INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------------------
1. Kindly submit a word document detailing your approaches and inferences
2. Kindly submit your runnable, reproduicble codes along with the word doc and any other results/documents and modules deemed necessary.

INPUT
---------------------------------
CORPUS_ONE.txt , CORPUS_TWO.txt AND TEST_CORPUS.txt 

Details:
Each file contains three columns;
COLUMN 1 - UNIQUE ID
COLUMN 2 - TEXT referred to as 'title' of individual documents (rows) in the corpus
COLUMN 3 - TEXT referred to as 'abstract' of individual documents (rows) in the corpus

TASKS
----------------------------------
1. Treat each file as individual corpus and run a clustering algorithm on each of the corpus
2. Test it against 'TEST_CORPUS.txt' 
3. You may combine both 'CORPUS_ONE.txt' and 'CORPUS_TWO.txt' as one corpus and repeat the task
4. You may please employ any preprocessing on the text in all CORPUS files befre training or employing a model (There are embedded xml tags like <strong>, </strong> etc., which may be cleaned)
5. Report your findings against different algorithms (at least two different algorithms) and an inference of which worked best with these corpus and why?
