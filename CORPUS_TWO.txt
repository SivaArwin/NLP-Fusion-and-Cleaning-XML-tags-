1	Magnetic Field Effect of Near-field Radiative Heat Transfer for SiC Nanowires/Plates	We demonstrate the near-field radiative transfer between two aligned SiC nanowires and plates under different magnetic field intensity, in which the Lorentz-Drude equations of dielectric constant tensor are proposed to describe the dielectric constant as magnetic field applied on the SiC structure. Using Local effective medium theory (EMT) and fluctuation-dissipation theorem, we evaluate the near-field radiation between SiC nanowires/plates with different filling ratio and gap distance under extent magnetic field. Compared to the near-field heat flux between two SiC plates, the one between SiC nanowires can be enhanced with magnetic field intensity, high filling ratio and small gap distance. The results of this work can further improve the study of near-field radiative transfer and beneficial to explore more approaches to enact the near field radiative transfer of nanostructure.
2	<strong>Plasmonic nanoparticle lithography: Fast resist-free laser technique for large-scale sub-50 nm hole array fabrication</strong>	Cheap large-scale fabrication of ordered nanostructures is important for multiple applications in photonics and biomedicine including optical filters, solar cells, protection marks, and membranes. Existing methods are either expensive or have strict limitations on the feature size and fabrication complexity. Here we present a new laser-based technique, plasmonic nanoparticle lithography, which is capable of rapid fabrication of large-scale arrays of sub-50 nm holes on various substrates. It is based on near-field enhancement and melting induced under ordered arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles, which are brought in contact or in close proximity with a desired material and acting as optical near-field lenses. The nanoparticles are arranged in ordered patterns on a flexible substrate and can be attached and removed from the patterned sample surface. They are not affected by the patterning process and can be reused multiple times as permanent near-field masks. This new resist-free nanolithography technique provides a simple and cheap solution for large-scale nanofabrication.
3	<strong>Spin coating of silver nanoparticle ink for semi-transparent and colored solar cells</strong>	This letter reports on the fabrication of colored and semi-transparent silver nanoparticle layers, and their optical properties for use in semi-transparent solar cell applications. A spin coating method, using silver nanoparticle inks (nanoinks), is used to deposit silver nanoparticle layers onto substrates. The transmittance, reflectance, and color of the silver nanoparticle layers, spin-coated with nanoinks, are significantly dependent on the spin speed and the nanoink concentration. However, similar optical effects do not occur with typical silver colloids. With semi-transparent silver nanoparticle layers, transmittances of over 20 % at visible light wavelength are obtained by increasing the spin speed. Different nanoink concentrations cause variations in the size and distribution of the nanoparticles, which significantly changes the optical properties of the silver nanoparticle layer. These results are associated with the excitation of the dipole or quadruple plasmon modes of the nanoparticles. The characteristic properties of the silver nanoparticles lead to a color variation of the substrates on which the nanoparticles are spin-coated. Furthermore, both color variation and efficiency improvement via light trapping are achieved with the application of silver nanoparticles to semi-transparent Si thin film solar cells. This concept, based on a metal plasmonic layer, fundamentally differs from the application of the color adjusting oxide films, which only induce color variation by the control of optical interference with different film thicknesses. The beneficial effect of spin-coated silver nanoparticle layers can be applied to other semi-transparent photovoltaic devices, due to the simplicity and the cost-effectiveness of the spin coating method.
4	Substrate-molecule decoupling induced by self-assembly &ndash; Implications for graphene nanoribbon fabrication	Interactions between conjugated organic molecules and metal surfaces are often very strong, resulting in extensive hybridization between the molecule and surface and the loss of well-defined frontier orbitals on the molecule. In this Letter, we use density functional theory calculations to show that, for the case of graphene nanoribbon precursor molecules adsorbed to copper surfaces <em>via</em> van der Waals forces, the surface-molecule interaction is weakened upon molecular self-assembly. This phenomenon, which we abbreviate as SAID (Self-Assembly Induced Decoupling), results in a partial recovery of frontier orbital density on the molecules. The SAID phenomenon opens a new topic in the field of organic-metal interface physics, and may have broader implications for thin film devices and catalysis.
5	Essential role of enhanced surface electron-phonon interaction on electrical transport of suspended polycrystalline gold nanofilms	The electrical resistivity of suspended polycrystalline gold nanofilms with different length has been measured in a temperature range of 2 K to 340 K, which dramatically increases compared with bulk gold and slightly increases with length. The classical size effect theories considering surface and grain boundary scatterings cannot explain the increased film resistivity, especially the temperature dependence of resistivity, in the whole temperature range. Considering the fact that the reduction of the coordination number of atoms at the surface and the interface leads to a decrease of the phonon spectrum frequency and consequently affects the surface phonon spectrum, the electron-phonon interaction as a relatively independent surface effect is taken into account. The theoretical predictions and the experimental measured film resistivity match very well in the whole temperature range and the extracted surface Debye temperature decreases significantly compared to the bulk value, which illustrates the essential role of enhanced surface electron-phonon interaction on electrical transport of the present gold nanofilms.
6	<strong>Fabrication of controllably variable sub-100 nm gaps in silver nanowires by photothermal-induced stress</strong>	A technique to fabricate nanogaps with controllably variable gap width in silver (Ag) nanowires (NWs) by photothermal-induced stress utilizing a focused continuous wave laser (532 nm) is presented. For the case of an Ag NW on gold thin film, a gap width starting from ~ 20 nm is achieved with a critical minimum power (CMP) of about 160 mW. Whereas in case of an Ag NW placed on top of a ZnO NW, the attained gap width is as small as a few nm (&lt; 10 nm) with a CMP of only ~ 100 mW. In both cases, the CMP is much lower as compared to the required CMP (~ 280 mW) for an Ag NW placed on a bare silica substrate. The photothermal-induced stress along with melting/sublimation of silver aids in breaking the Ag NW. In particular, the former one plays a key role in attaining extremely narrow gap. This technique to fabricate sub-100 nm nanogaps in metal NWs can be extensively implemented in fabrication and maintenance of nanomechanical, nanoplasmonic and nanoelectronic devices.
7	<strong>Resistive Switching study in HfO<sub>2</sub> based OxRAM by Conductive Atomic Force Microscopy in Vacuum</strong>	This study aims to characterize the oxide based Resistive Random Access Memory (OxRAM) memory cell at nanoscale. Resistive memory stacks were characterized by conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) under vacuum. The AFM tips served as top electrode. The effect of different tip material, polarity, bottom electrode and compliance current on resistive switching are described and compared with results obtained for devices at micrometric scale. The experimental results are then interpreted by a filament based model. An interpretation in term of conductive filament geometry is finally given.
8	<strong>Effect of CNT coating on the overall thermal conductivity of unidirectional polymer hybrid nanocomposites</strong>	The role of carbon nanotube (CNT) coating on the carbon fiber (CF) surfaces in the effective thermal conductivities of the unidirectional polymer hybrid nanocomposites is investigated by a newly presented multi-stage micromechanical method. The constructional feature of the hybrid nanocomposite is that randomly oriented CNTs grown on the CF surfaces. For simulating, a new version of the semi-empirical Halpin-Tsai (H-T) model is appropriately coupled with an analytical unit cell micromechanical model developed in the present research. The model captures the influences of the CNTs random dispersion, waviness, length, diameter, volume fraction and the CNT/polymer interfacial thermal resistance and also the CF cross-section shape parameters. The predicted results for the thermal conductivities of fibrous composites and polymer nanocomposites containing CNTs are verified with the available experimental data and a very good agreement is found. The results show that the longitudinal thermal conductivity of CF-reinforced hybrid nanocomposites is not affected by the CNTs coating. However, the nanocomposites transverse thermal conductivities are significantly enhanced over those of the conventional fibrous composites without the CNTs coating. An improvement in the nanocomposites transverse thermal conducting behavior can be observed with (i) increasing the CNTs volume fraction and length (ii) using straight CNTs and (iii) forming a perfect bonding interface.
9	<strong>Lattice thermal conductivity of graphitic carbon nanoparticles derived from pyrolytic glucose</strong>	The lattice thermal conductivity is reported for graphitic carbon nanoparticles (GCPs) carbonized from glucose by the solid-state pyrolysis route. Both the out-of-plane and the in-plane coherence length are calculated to increase with the carbonization temperature ranging from 700 &deg;C to 1200 &deg;C. Temperature and excitation power dependent Raman scattering measurements are performed to understand the thermal conductivity of GCPs related to the G-peaks. Unexpectedly, the thermal conductivities of the polymeric nanocomposites based on GCPs are also strongly dependent on the graphitization levels of GCPs, and a clear signature of thermal percolation threshold can be found.
10	Note: On the dielectric constant of nanoconfined water	Investigations of dielectric properties of water in nanoconfinement arehighly relevant for various applications. Here, using a simple capacitor model,we show that the low dielectric constant of nanoconfined water found inmolecular dynamics simulations can be largely explained by the so-calleddielectric dead-layer effect known for ferroelectric nanocapacitors.
11	Reversal time of jump-noise driven magnetization dynamics in nanomagnets via Monte Carlo simulations	The jump-noise is a nonhomogeneous Poisson process which models thermal e&#xFB00;ects in magnetization dynamics, with special applications in low temperature escape rate phenomena. In this work, we develop improved numerical methods for Monte Carlo simulation of jump-noise dynamics, and validate the method by comparing the stationary distribution obtained numerically against the analytic Boltzmann distribution. In accordance with the Ne&eacute;l-Brown theory, jump-noise dynamics display an exponential relaxation toward equilibrium with a characteristic reversal time, which we extract for nanomagnets with uniaxial and cubic anisotropy. We also identify an analytic upper bound on the strength of jump-noise: this bound establishes the regime of small noise in which an equivalent Gilbert damping coe&#xFB03;cient can be de&#xFB01;ned within the classical framework of magnetization dynamics.
12	<strong>Hierarchical Ag nanostructures on Sn-doped indium oxide nano-branches: Super hydrophobic surface for surface-enhanced Raman scattering</strong>	Herein, we fabricated a super-hydrophobic SERS substrate using Sn-doped indium oxide (Indium-tin-oxide: ITO) nano-branches as a template. ITO nano-branches with tens of nanometer diameter are first fabricated through the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth to provide roughness of the substrate. 10nm thickness of Ag thin film was deposited and then treated with the post-annealing process to create numerous air-pockets in the Ag film, forming a hierarchical Ag nanostructures. The resulting substrate obtained Cassie&rsquo;s wetting property with a water contact angle of 151<sup>&ordm;</sup>. Compared to the normal hydrophobic Ag nanoparticle substrate, increase of about 4.25-fold higher SERS signal was obtained for 7&mu;L of rhodamine 6G aqueous solutions.
13	The role of defects in the simple cubic phase of the C82 nano-crystal by using Ewald method	In conjunction with the local- field method and Ewald method, the complex non-Hermitian dielectric tensor is theoretically calculated by using Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model for the simple cubic (sc) phase of the C82 crystal with it defects. Via removing the hexagonal and the pentagon next to each other, the dielectric tensor changed and defects affect the optical properties of the C82 crystal. The removal of atoms or the C82 defected crystal reduces the intensity of the optical spectrum.
14	Molecular Dynamics Simulation for the impact of the Electric Field on the water condensation on the wall	A detailed analysis of the effects of the electric field (EF) intensity and the surface wettability on the condensation of the water on the wall is performed by Molecular dynamics simulations. The existence of the EF leads to the reorientation of the dipole moment of water molecules. The water molecules tend to the direction of the EF with its strength increasing. As leads to the morphology of the droplet condensed on the surface transforming from ellipsoid to nanocolumnar. The density of the clusters formed on the wall is affected by the EF. In addition, the deposition of water molecules on the surface will be suppressed with the EF to bate the energy exchange between the molecules and the wall. This leads to cutting down the rate of condensation. The strength of the wettability of the surface enhances the resistance of the wall for the reorientation of the dipole moment of water molecules. Moreover, the EF strength required for making the cluster deform will rise, and the rate of deposition of water molecules on the surface is suppressed as the EF elevates.
15	Analysis of Zn Substitution on Structure, Optical Absorption, Magnetization and High Temperature Specific Heat Anomaly of the Nano-Crystalline LaFeO<sub>3</sub>	Nano-crystalline LaFe<sub>1-x</sub>Zn<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (0 &le; x &le; 0.3) samples synthesized through sol-gel auto combustion technique have been studied. X-ray diffraction patterns reveal that the nanoparticles have orthorhombic crystal structure and exist in single phase with Zn doping.&nbsp; Bond lengths and bond angles change with concentration, leading to the modification of parent structure; the change in structure is reflected in the thermal measurements too. Optical properties have been studied using infra red spectroscopy in the wave number range of 400cm<sup>-1</sup>-4000 cm<sup>-1 </sup>and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in the wavelength range of 200nm-800nm. FTIR spectra show two strong active vibrational bands present at 564 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 410 cm<sup>-1</sup>, that are related to the functional groups present in the material. Optical bandgap has been determined and is found to decrease with the increase in concentration of Zn. The optical band gap lies in the range of 2.5eV-2.2eV. Raman study rules out the symmetry breaking or any other structural phase transition in the system. The Raman spectra reveal the strain present in the samples on increasing the concentration of Zn doping.&nbsp; The variation of specific heat at wide temperature range 30<sup>o</sup>C-900<sup>o</sup>C is reported. Specific heat has been found to be sensitive to magnetic ordering. The Neel temperature has been decreased with increasing Zn concentration from 411<sup>o</sup>C to 377<sup>o</sup>C, which is concomitant with the Rietveld analysis. Decreased density of material in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LaFe<sub>1-x</sub>Zn<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> samples leads to the increased specific heat. Hysteresis loops indicate that Zn doping increases the magnetic moment and decreases the coercivity.
16	<strong>Brillouin light scattering investigation of interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in ultrathin Co/Pt nanostripe arrays </strong>	Interface Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) is known to induce spin-waves non-reciprocity in ultrathin films. Indeed, Brillouin light scattering has been used to investigate how the lateral size reduction can affect the iDMI constant in Pt (6 nm)/Co (3 nm) based-nanostripe arrays. For this, 100 and 300 nm-width nanostripes have been fabricated using e-beam lithography and ion etching, and their behaviour has then been compared to a reference continuous film. The experimental data showed that the measured iDMI induced non-reciprocity is slightly different for the 100 nm-width nanostripes with respect to the other samples. This suggests that the width of the nanostripes can influence the strength of the apparent iDMI if this dimension is comparable to the spin waves attenuation length propagating within the nanostripes. Indeed, in contrast to the other samples, the linear frequency difference (non-reciprocity) behaviour versus wavenumber for the 100 nm-width nanostripes has been analysed and discussed through two approaches: either different iDMI constant or iDMI constant similar to one of the continuous film with a non-zero intercept for zero wavenumber.
17	Nanoscale stickiness of the hydrogen bond	The exclusion of water molecules surrounding a hydrogen bond modulates the dielectric response, thereby strengthening the underlying electrostatics. Thus, a nanoscale stickiness to nonpolar materials is apparent and has a mechanical equivalent accessible to molecular force probes. This "wrapping drag" is known to drive fundamental biological processes but its physical underpinnings have been lacking. As shown, quantification of the dielectric modulation requires a nanoscale dielectric theory and a thermodynamic ansatz yielding the reversible work required to unwrap a hydrogen bond. Theoretical computation and experimental validation of this parameter result from reconciliation of discrete molecular behavior with continuum electrostatics laws.
18	Static strain tuning of quantum dots embedded in a photonic wire	We use strain to statically tune the semiconductor band gap of individual InAs quantum dots (QDs) embedded in a GaAs photonic wire featuring very efficient single photon collection efficiency. Thanks to the geometry of the structure, we are able to shift the QD excitonic transition by more than 20 meV by using nano-manipulators to apply the stress. Moreover, owing to the strong transverse strain gradient generated in the structure, we can relatively tune two QDs located in the wire waveguide and bring them in resonance, opening the way to the observation of collective effects such as superradiance.
19	Measurement of anisotropic thermal conductivity of a dense forest ofsnanowires using the 3w method	The 3w method is a dynamic measurement technique developed for determining the thermal conductivity of thin films or semi-infinite bulk materials. A simplified model is often applied to deduce the thermal conductivity from the slope of the real part of the ac temperature amplitude as a function of the logarithm of frequency, which in-turn brings a limitation on the kind of samples under observation. In this work, we have measured the thermal conductivity of a forest of nanowires embedded in nanoporous alumina membranes using the 3w method. An analytical solution of 2D heat conduction is then used to model the multilayerssystem, considering the anisotropic thermal properties of the different layers, substrate thermal conductivity and their thicknesses. Data treatment is performed by fitting the experimental results with the 2D model on two different sets of nanowires (silicon and BiSbTe) embedded in the matrix of nanoporous alumina template, having thermal conductivities that differ by at least one order of magnitude. These experimental results show that this method extends the applicability of the 3! technique to more complex systems having anisotropicsthermally properties.
20	Interaction energy of a pair of identical coplanar uniformly charged nanodisks	We consider a nanosystem consisting of two coplanar uniformly charged nanodisks that are coupled via Coulomb forces. Such a model represents a typical situation encountered in two-dimensional semiconductor quantum dot systems of electrons.sWe provide an exact integral expression for the interaction energy between the two coplanar nanodisks as a function of their separation distance.sIt is found that the difference between a standard Coulomb potential and the current one has features reminiscent of a Lennard-Jones interaction potential.sThe results derived can be useful to understand formation of clusters and/or aggregates in systems of coplanar charged nanodisks that contain electrons.
21	Two-stage DNA compaction induced by silver ions suggests a cooperative binding mechanism	The interaction between silver ions and DNA plays an important role in therapeutic use of silver ions and in related technologies such as DNA sensors. However, the underlying mechanism has not been fully understood. In this study, the dynamics of Ag<sup>+</sup>-DNA interaction at a single-molecule level was studied using magnetic tweezers. AgNO<sub>3 </sub>solutions with concentrations ranging from 1 &#x00B5;M to 20 &#x00B5;M led to a 1.4-1.8 &#x00B5;m decrease in length of a single &#x03BB;-DNA molecule, indicating that Ag<sup>+</sup> has a strong binding with DNA, causing the DNA conformational change. The compaction process comprises one linear declining stage and another sigmoid-shaped stage, which can be attributed to the interaction mechanism. Considering cooperative effect, the sigmoid trend was well-explained using a phenomenological model. In contrast, addition of silver nanoparticle solution induced no detectable transition of DNA. The dependence of the interaction on ionic strength and DNA concentration were examined via morphology characterization and particle size distribution measurements. The size of the Ag<sup>+</sup> -DNA complex decreased with increase in Ag ionic strength ranging from 1 &#x00B5;M to 1 mM. Morphology characterization confirmed that silver ions induced DNA to adopt a compacted globular conformation. At a fixed [AgNO3]:[DNA base pairs] ratio, increasing DNA concentration led to increased sizes of the complexes. Intermolecular interaction is believed to affect the Ag<sup>+</sup>-DNA complex formation to a large extent.
22	Inhibition of High Shear Arterial Thrombosis by Charged Nanoparticles	Platelet accumulation under high shear rates at the site of atherosclerotic plaque rupture leads to myocardial infarction and stroke. Current antiplatelet therapies remain ineffective within a large percentage of the population, while presenting significant risks for bleeding. We explore a novel way to inhibit arterial thrombus formation by biophysical means without the use of platelet inactivating drugs. Our computational multi-scale dynamics model has identified that charged particles of a specific size can entangle vWF polymers and reduce the amount of elongation at high shear rates. We tested these predictions using negatively charged nanoparticles (CNP) to inhibit arterial thrombus formation. CNP of a particular size and charge inhibited thrombus formation, with a 10-fold peak inhibition over control conditions of thrombotic occlusion. Particles of differing material composition, size, and charge had little effect as predicted by computational studies. This study demonstrates a new antithrombotic agent with potentially greater safety and efficacy than current pharmaceutical therapies.
23	Unexpected large nanoparticle size of single dimer hotspot systems for broadband SERS enhancement	We have numerically demonstrated the feasibility and possibility to achieve broadband surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement in the visible and near-infrared wavelength range using single nanoparticle (NP) dimer hotspot systems. Instead of the conventionally reported sub-100 nm, we find that the optimal NP size is as large as 200 nm in diameter for both Ag and Au. The key lies in the continuous arising of the bonding dipole plasmon (BDP) mode and higher-order resonances at shorter wavelengths. Further, it is revealed that the near- and far-field optical responses of these hotspot systems correlate well with each other, despite of the intrinsic enormous near- to far-field redshift for individual large NPs. The physical principles demonstrated here benefit significantly the fundamental understanding and engineering optimization of broadband SERS substrates.
24	Response to Comment on "Water-processed carbon nanotube/graphene hybrids with enhanced field emission properties"	In this response, we explain the points mentioned by R. Rani and R. Bhatia in their Comment for our previous paper [AIP Advances 5, 097130 (2015); Ref. 1], that the high value of &#x03B2; obtained in Ref. 1 is misleading because it does not corroborate with the obtained Jmax, and the obtained value of Jmax is "low" in the mentioned study as compared to the reported values [J. Appl. Phys. 111, 044307 (2012) & Appl. Phys. Lett. 102, 033102 (2013); Ref. 2 & 3]. For the high value of &#x03B2;, the obtained current Jmax is corroborated but such high value is mainly due to the multistage effect when CNTs are deposited on the rough surface of reduced graphene. For the "low" Jmax, although this is true when compared with Ref. 2 and 3, but we believe that our value is a generally common value when compared with other reports [Diam. Relat. Mater. 47, 1 (2014); J. Alloys Compd. 610, 659 (2014); J. Nanomater. 2013, 5239 (2013); Ref. 4-6] using the similar method as described in Ref. 1. Therefore, the conclusions from the experimental results on field emission performance of CNT/graphene composite materials in Ref. 1 are reliable.
25	<strong>Guided mode resonance of nanoantenna to achieve enhanced Raman signal from blu-ray DVD</strong><strong>Guided mode resonance of nanoantenna to achieve enhanced Raman signal from blu-ray DVD</strong>	We report here the working of a simple yet highly reproducible surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate by efficiently guiding localized plasmon resonance mode from metal nanoantenna by trapping it in the channels of a blu-ray digital versatile disc (BR-DVD). The patterned structure of a blank BR-DVD which is made of polycarbonate material has a periodicity of 320nm with channel width of 100nm. Due to high refractive index (1.58) of the material, the locally generated resonance electromagnetic field in metal nanoparticles is efficiently guided by the channel of the disc. This would cause an overall enhancement of Raman signal intensity for any SERS based sensing studies. Using the proposed substrate, SERS based studies have been performed for two commonly used chemicals.
26	Enhanced chemotherapeutic efficacy of the low-dose doxorubicin in breast cancer via nanoparticle delivery system cross-linked hyaluronic acid	Despite the development of treatment options in breast cancer, many patients died of recurrence and metastasis. Owing to enhanced permeability and retention effect in solid tumor tissue, nanoparticles delivery systems have been emerged as novel strategy in cancer chemotherapy. As extracellular matrix glycosamino-glycan hyaluronan (HA) could bind its surface receptor adhesion molecule CD44 which strongly expressed on breast cancer. We have previously reported a DOX-loaded HA-Lys-LA X-NPs (X-NP-DOX) nanoparticles delivery system for breast cancer treatment. In the present study, we further investigated the antitumor effect of X-NP-DOX nanoparticles delivery system using low-dose DOX in both in vitro and in vivo systems. We demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX possessed the ability for inhibiting MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth, invasion and migration, and inducing apoptosis in vitro. In in vivo experiments, injection of low-dose X-NP-DOX into tumor-bearing mouse resulted in significant reduction of tumor size. TUNEL staining further revealed that low-dose X-NP-DOX induced higher percentage of apoptotic cells compared with free DOX or Saline. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX inhibited Notch1 and Ras/MAPK pathways, decreased cancer stem cells (CSCs) population, reduced tumorigenesis compared to free DOX in both in vitro or in vivo settings. Owing to its enhanced efficacy and higher targetability compared to free DOX, low-dose DOX delivered by nanoparticle system may be a promising novel strategy for breast cancer treatment.
27	AC impedance spectroscopy response of the effect of the modifier carbon chain length on the dielectric properties of Ag@TiO<sub>2</sub>/poly(vinylidene fluoride) nanocomposites	In this letter, poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-based nanocomposites filled with surface-functionalized Ag@TiO<sub>2</sub> core-shell nanoparticles were fabricated. High dielectric permittivity was realized by introducing Ag@TiO<sub>2</sub> core-shell nanoparticles into the PVDF. Using two phosphonic acids surfactants with different carbon&nbsp;chain&nbsp;lengths, octyl and octadecyl phosphonic acid, we modified the filler surface to improve the dispersion of the core-shell filler in the PVDF. Experimental results showed that the dielectric constant of the composite containing fillers modified by octyl phosphonic acid (148 at 1 KHz) was almost three times higher than that modified by octadecyl phosphonic acid (58 at 1 KHz) at the same filler loading. By introducing a circuit model based on AC impedance spectroscopy (AC-IS), we analyzed the mechanism of interfacial polarization between the modified core-shell filler and polymer matrix.
28	Study on A New Self-sensing Magneto-rheological Elastomer Bearing	The complexity of a semi-active vibration isolation system makes it could be difficult to play the role effectively on the impact load. A new self-sensing bearing based on the modified anisotropic magneto-rheological elastomer (MRE) which fabricated by dispersed multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and carbonyl iron particles (CIPs) into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix under a magnetic field was proposed. Firstly, the working conditions of bearing were analyzed and decoupled, an optimal structure size of bearing was selected and used for the build-up the experiment test system. Then, the self-sensing characteristic of the MRE bearing under the multi-field-coupling of load and magnetic fields was investigated by this test system. The results showed that the resistance of the modified MRE which has been applied a preload by the bearing also can be changed about 28%~56% under the extrusion force, mechanical force and external magnetic field. Finally, the mechanical properties of the magneto-rheological elastomer bearing (MRB) was also tested, and the stiffness and damping can increase 1~2.7 and 1~2.37 times under the external controlled current, respectively. This study confirms that the modified MRE of the MRB are potentially capable of being used as actuator and sensor simultaneously.
29	Magnetic polymer nanocomposites based on polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) and magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) nanoparticles &nbsp;for the absorption of high frequency electromagnetic waves	<em>In the presented work nanocomposites based on polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) and </em><em>magnetic </em><em>Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4&nbsp; </sub></em><em>nanoparticles </em><em>were prepared</em><em>. The structure and content of nanocomposite materials were studied by using SEM, TEM, AFM and X-Ray phase analysis. Magnetic properties of </em><em>PVDF+Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4&nbsp; </sub></em><em>nanocomposites have been studied&nbsp; upon increasing nanoparticle content in polymer matrix up to 20%,&nbsp; revealing a superparamagnetic behaviour as </em><em>Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub></em><em>nanoparticles in polymer matrix act out like single-domain particles. It has also been observed that, </em><em>PVDF+Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub></em><em> based nanocomposites can absorb the electromagnetic waves in the high frequency range 0,1-30 GHz. </em><em>It has been shown that </em><em>the absorption of electromagnetic waves by PVDF+</em><em>Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub></em><em> nanocomposites can be explained by the different molecular structures and also by the scattering of the electromagnetic waves at the boundary of nanoparticle-polymer matrix. It has been established that due to the different Maxwell relaxation times of the nanocomposite components, the energy refraction at the interface of two components is increased.</em>
30	A comparative study on phase locking of spin transfer nano-oscillators using commonsmicrowave sources	Phase-locking or synchronization is a typical nonlinear phenomenon which can be achieved insvery many ways. One of the most prominent ways of achieving it is by injection locking, that isslocking the oscillations to an external applied oscillating source of frequency nearly equal to thesoscillator frequency. For a spin transfer nano oscillator (STNO), one can apply an external sourcesby means of two ways: they are (i) through an alternating spin current and (ii) through an externalsmicrowave magnetic field. We have compared both the above methods of phase-locking by studyingsthe synchronization of STNOs and made a critical comparison to show the effectiveness of usingsmicrowave magnetic field as an external driving source.
31	<strong>Shape-memory photonic metamaterial</strong>	Non-volatile temperature-induced structural phase transitions such as those found in &nbsp;chalcogenide glasses and chalcogenide-based nanostructures are known to lead to strong changes in their optical properties and are widely used in rewritable optical disk technology. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that thermally-activated optical memory can be achieved with a fully metallic plasmonic metamaterial made from shape memory alloy. A Nickel Titanium film of nanoscale thickness structured on the subwavelength scale exhibits bistability of its optical properties upon temperature cycling between 30 &deg;C and 210 &deg;C. The structure which consists of an array of NiTi nanowires covered with a nanoscale thickness gold layer to enhance its plasmonic properties, shows two non-volatile states with an optical reflectivity difference of 12% associated with the nanoscale displacements of alternating nanowires in the structure. We argue that robust, all-metal shape memory photonic metamaterials can find applications in bistable optical devices.
32	<strong>Development of </strong><strong>solid-solid bonding with the super</strong> <strong>thickness of </strong><strong>porous </strong><strong>Ag in die-attached modules structure</strong>	Bonding technology with a super thickness (500&micro;m) of die-attached bonding layer was developed by using solid porous Ag in the die-attached module structure. In this technology, solid porous Ag structures was fabricated by sintering Ag-paste, the interface between two solid porous Ag were bonded together with the hillocks growth as well as Ag nanoparticles formation. The interface connection ratio achieved almost 90 % and the bonding strength over 30 MPa in the die-attached module structure. Most important, bonding strength did not change with the thickness of die-attached bonding layers various from 100 &micro;m to 500 &micro;m. Finite element simulation analyses confirmed that an increase of the bonding layer thickness will lead to a significant decrease of the occurred stress in the die-attached module structure. It provided a new bonding technology based on the solid porous Ag structure especially a method to fabricate the thicker die-attached bonding layer in the die-attached module structure for its high temperature applications.
33	Investigation of the expansion dynamics of silicon plasmas generated by double nanosecond laser pulses	A systematic investigation of the expansion dynamics of plasma plumes generated by two Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers at 1064 nm wavelength operating on a silicon target was undertaken for the inter-pulse delay times of 0, 100, 200, and 400 ns using a technique involving fast-gated intensified charge-coupled device imaging. Our results indicate that the plasmas exhibit free expansion in a vacuum environment at an inter-pulse delay time of 0 ns. With increasing inter-pulse delay time, the plasma front becomes sharpened and an interaction boundary is formed. Moreover, using to the radiation intensity distribution along the plasma axis of symmetry, the formation and evolution mechanism of the plasmas generated by the double pulses was analyzed at different inter-pulse delay times. Finally, the experimental results of the expansion of the plasma core and front were compared with a radiation hydrodynamics model and a drag model, and were found to be generally in good agreement.
34	Quantitative Comparison of Closed-Loop and Dual Harmonic Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy Techniques	Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) is a widely used technique to map surface potentials at the nanometer scale. In traditional KPFM, a feedback loop regulates the DC bias applied between a sharp conductive probe and sample to nullify the electrostatic force (closed-loop operation). In comparison, open-loop techniques such as dual harmonic KPFM (DH-KPFM) are simpler to implement, less sensitive to artefacts and offer the unique ability to probe voltage sensitive materials and operate in liquid environments. Here, we directly compare the two techniques in terms of their bandwidth and sensitivity to instrumentation artefacts. Furthermore, we introduce a new correction for traditional KPFM termed 'setpoint correction', which allows us to obtain agreement between open and closed-loop techniques within 1%. Quantitative validation of DH-KPFM may lead to a wider adoption of open-loop KPFM techniques by the scanning probe community.
35	Analytical Study On Effects Of Mn Substitution In Cobalt Ferrite	Ferrites are usually ferromagnetic materials consisting of iron oxide phases combined with one or more metallic oxides. They are being now used in diversified fields owing to possibility of synthesizing them in the form of nanoparticles. Cobalt ferrites are best known candidate for use in various sensor applications. Recently Mn2+ doped Cobalt ferrites have received renewed attention for understanding of their tenable behavior and tuning of fundamental magnetic properties to optimize them in advanced applications as revealed from various literature reviews. Three compositions of Mn doped Cobalt ferrites have undertaken for analytical study to understand effects of Mn substitutions on their fundamental magnetic properties. Impact of Mn content on lattice constant, hoping and bond lengths, magnetic moment, Curie temperature and porosity has been discussed in this analytical study to predict the controlling of magnetization, magnetomechanical property and superparamagnetism (SPM) by adjusting dopant content. The lattice constant found to decrease and effective magnetic moment &mu; to increase with the Mn content, substituted for Co, which may be significant to the tunability of the Curie temperature, TC and have influence on SPM. On the other hand, the compositions where Mn substituted for Fe may increase the porosity due to their increased bond lengths with Mn content and thus may optimize them for applications in gas sensors. However, the analysis and findings are completely based on theoretical aspect in this paper and needs verification experimentally to confirm and supplement the prediction.
36	<strong>Enhanced thermoelectric performance through grain boundary engineering in quaternary chalcogenide Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnSe<sub>4</sub></strong>	Quaternary chalcognide Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnSe<sub>4</sub> (CZTSe) is a promising wide band-gap p-type thermoelectric material. The structure and thermoelectric properties of lead substituted Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSn<sub>1-x</sub>Pb<sub>x</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> are investigated. Lead primarily exists in the framework of PbSe as demonstrated by x-ray diffraction and calculation of x-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy. The second phase distributes at the boundaries of CZTSe with thickness in several hundreds of nanometer. With appropriate grain boundary engineering, the enhancement of power factor and a decrease of thermal conductivity can be achieved simultaneously. As a result, a maximum figure of merit zT of 0.45 is obtained for the sample with x=0.02 at 723K.
37	Strong Correlation between the Magnetocaloric Properties of Nanotubes of La0.325Pr0.3Ca0.375MnO3 and their Diameters.	Under 0.01 T applied magnetic field variation, the calculation of magnetocaloric properties for 200 and 800 nm nanotubes of La0.325Pr0.3Ca0.375MnO3 (LPCMO) perovskite such as magnetic entropy change, full-width at half-maximum, relative cooling power, and magnetic specific heat change. MCE of 800 nm nanotubes of LPCMO is more than MCE of 800 nm ones. LPCMO nanotubes have hopeful application for MR in an extended high-temperature range due to high values of &#x03B4;TFWHM. Therefore, nanotubes of LPCMO are very significant for MR applications, especially nitrogen liquefier.
38	<strong>Low intrinsic c-axis thermal conductivity in PVD grown epitaxial Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> films<sup></sup></strong>	Accurate determination and comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic c-axis thermal conductivity of thermoelectric layered Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> is of high importance for the development of strategies to optimize the figure of merit in thin film devices via heterostructures and defect engineering. We present here high precision measurements of &nbsp;of epitaxial Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> thin films on Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> substrates grown by physical vapor deposition (PVD) in the temperature range of 100 K to 300 K. The Kapitza resistances of the involved interfaces have been determined and subtracted from the film data, allowing access to the intrinsic thermal conductivity of single crystalline Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>. At room temperature, we obtain = 1.6 W/mK, being much smaller than the in-plane thermal conductivity of &nbsp;= 5 W/mK and even lower than the thermal conductivity of nanocrystalline films of k<sub>nc</sub> &asymp; 2.0-2.6 W/mK published by Park et al.[i]. High crystallinity and very low defect concentration of the films were confirmed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Our data reveal that the phonon mean free path &nbsp;is not limited by defect scattering and is of intrinsic nature, i.e. due to phonon-phonon scattering similar to other soft van der Waals type bonded layered systems.s<p>[i] N.-W.

39	<strong>Characterization of Floating-gate Memory Device with Thiolate-Protected Gold and Gold-Palladium Nanoclusters</strong>	The floating-gate memory characteristics of thiolate-protected gold (Au:SR) and palladium doped Au (AuPd:SR) nanoclusters, Au<sub>25</sub>(SR)<sub>18</sub>, Au<sub>24</sub>Pd(SR)<sub>18</sub>, and Au<sub>38</sub>(SR)<sub>24</sub> (R = C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>25</sub>), were investigated by capacitance-voltage (<em>C&ndash;V</em>) measurements in vacuum. Monolayer films of Au:SR nanoclusters were formed as floating-gate memory layers on p-type Si substrates by the Langmuir-Schaefer method with surface pressure - area (&pi;-<em>A</em>) isotherm measurements. A fluoropolymer (CYTOP, ~15 nm thick) was spin-coated on top to form a hydrophobic insulating layer. Using an Au pad (~40 nm thick) as the gate electrode, <em>C&ndash;V</em> measurements exhibit clockwise hysteresis curves originating from the Au:SR and AuPd:SR nanoclusters against the reference measured in each sample, and the hysteresis widths were dependent on the composition and sizes of the Au:SR nanoclusters. The positive and negative voltage shifts in the hysteresis can be explained in terms of electronic structures in Au:SR and AuPd:SR-based devices.
40	A novel bonding method for fabrication of PMMA nanofluidic chip with extremely low deformation of the nano-trenches	All PMMA-based nanofluidic chips are becoming increasingly important for biological and medical applications. To fabricate PMMA nanofluidic chips, the open nano-trenches should be sealed by thermal bonding method. However, the present thermal bonding method suffers from high deformation of nano-trenches due to PMMA softening near glass transition temperature. In this work, a novel bonding technique, based on acetone and ethanol (v:v, 8:2) treatment, is developed to adjust the Young's modulus of PMMA in its surface layer. By optimizing nanoimprinting and bonding process, PMMA nanofluidic chip was fabricated without undesired nano-trench deformation. The integrity of the enclosed PMMA nanofluidic system was verified by a fluorescence filling experiment.
41	A universal mechanism for enhancing the thermoelectricity of nanoribbons by branching	Inspired by the novel mechanism of reducing thermal conductivity by local phonon resonance instead of by inducing structural defects, we investigate the effect of side branching on the thermoelectric properties of $\rm{MoS_{2}}$ nanoribbons, and prove that side branching is a highly efficient mechanism for enhancing the thermoelectricity of different kinds of nanoribbons. For both armchair and zigzag $\rm{MoS_{2}}$ nanoribbons, the side branches result in not only significant reduction of thermal conductance but also notable increase of the Seebeck coefficient. Consequently, the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of the armchair $\rm{MoS_{2}}$ nanoribbon is boosted from 0.72 to as high as 1.93, and the originally non-thermoelectric metallic zigzag $\rm{MoS_{2}}$ nanoribbon is turned into a thermoelectric material due to the appearance of the band gap induced by the side branches. These results mean that the mechanism of branching is not only very efficient, but also takes effect regardless of the original properties of the nanoribbons, and thus will hold great promise for its application in the thermoelectric field.
42	<strong>Strain engineering on electronic structure and carrier mobility in</strong><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong><strong><strong>monolayer GeP</strong></strong><strong><sub><strong>3</strong></sub></strong>	Using density functional theory coupled with Boltzmann transport equation with relaxation time approximation, we have studied the strain effect on the electronic structure and carrier mobility of two-dimensional (2D) monolayer GeP<sub>3</sub>.&nbsp;We find that the energies of valence&nbsp;band maximum and conduction&nbsp;band minimum are nearly linearly shifted with biaxial strain, and the band structure experience a remarkable transition from semiconductor to metal with appropriate compression (-5% strain). Under biaxial strain, the mobilities of electron and hole in monolayer GeP<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;reduce and increase by more than one&nbsp;order of magnitude,&nbsp;respectively.&nbsp;It is suggested&nbsp;that it is possible to perform successive transitions from <em>n</em>-type semiconductor (-4% strain)&nbsp;to good performance <em>p</em>-semiconductor (+6% strain)&nbsp;by applying strain in monolayer GeP<sub>3</sub>, which is potentially useful for flexible electronics&nbsp;and nanosized mechanical sensors.
43	<strong>Optical Extinction Efficiencies for Metallic Single Wall Carbon Nanotubes in the Infrared Spectral Region</strong>	The extinction efficiency (mass normalized extinction cross section) of a sample of metallic single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) has been measured in the infrared spectral region. The tubes were obtained from Nano-Integris Inc. and measured while suspended in propanol. Calculation of the extinction efficiency based on a computational code for fibers of finite length shows good agreement with the experimental results. The computation involved convolution over the SWCNTs&rsquo; length and diameter distributions. The results emphasize the potential of SWCNTs as efficient obscurants of electromagnetic radiation in the infrared spectral region.
44	Phenomenological modelling of light transmission through nanowires arrays	A phenomenological model has been developed and is discussed. The model is able to describe the experimentally measured light transmission of nanowires arrays. A slab of nanospheres and rough layers with thickness waviness were combined to simplify the nanowires structure description. This phenomenological description was proven to be feasible by fitting experimental data. As a conclusion, light transmitted through randomly distributed nanowires can be explained by the combination of volume and surface scatterings using respectively Mie theory and rough Fresnel coefficients at the interfaces.
45	Novel facets of multifunctional Ag@Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;core-shell nanoparticles for multimodal imaging applications	Multifunctional biocompatible nanoparticles, with magnetic core and optically active shell, acting as multifunctional nanoparticles with core size 6 nm encapsulated by varying silver shell thickness were synthesized through novel single phase microemulsion method. Incorporation of silver shell on to the magnetite core enhances the intensity of highest luminescence peak observed for magnetite up to very significant luminescence enhancement factor. A blue photoluminescence (PL) peak observed in the visible region of spectrum, brighten further with the increase in the thickness of silver shell. The magnetic properties of these core- shell nanomaterials shows superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature, which is a mandatory criteria for MRI contrast enhancement agents. The hyperthermic response of synthesized magnetite nanoparticles elevates its temperature to 43&deg; C in a sharp span of time, which is above the desired temperature for therapeutic application of these multifunctional nanomaterials. &nbsp;These excellent optical and magnetic properties, in the material having size range suitable for cellular uptake, make it a potential candidate for both diagnostic and therapeutic use in biomedical applications.
46	Mg3F7: a superatom with potential for new nanomaterials design	The superhalogen features of polynuclear structures are theoretically investigated here for Mg3F7 clusters. At the CCSD(T) and OVGF level, the Mg3F7 cluster has been confirmed to be superhalogen due to its high electron affinity (7.9 eV). The corresponding daughter anionic species (Mg3F7&#x2212;) displays a highly symmetric (C3v) umbrella-like structure and magic cluster stability. The enlarged stability of the Mg3F7&#x2212; nonstoichiometric system is the result of its electronic shell saturation and superhalogen nature of its neutral parent. The extra electron of the Mg3F7&#x2212; anion aggregates on the terminal fluorine ligands with non-negligible distribution occurring on the bridging F units too. These two properties lower both the kinetic and potential energies of the extra electron respectively and thus lead to large electron binding energy. When interacting with the fullerene nanoparticle (C60), the radical neutral Mg3F7 superhalogen captures an electron and forms stable and strongly bound "binary salt" consisted of Mg3F7&#x2212; anion and C60&#x2022;+ radical cation. In other words, the C60Mg3F7 compound resembles a diatomic molecule with an ionic bond (such as sodium chloride). Thus Mg3F7 can be used as an effective oxidizing agent to construct new ionized nanomaterials.
47	Buongiorno's model for fluid flow of 3D Oldroyd-B magneto nanofluid with nonlinear thermal radiation-A series solution	This study examines the flow of 3D Oldroyd-B magneto nanofluid under the influence of nonlinear thermal radiation and convective heat and mass boundary conditions. Temperature dependent thermal conductivity with Joule heating and viscous dissipation are also added to novelty of the problem. Buongiorno's model featuring Brownian diffusion and thermophoresis is adopted here. Renowned Homotopy Analysis method (HAM) is adopted to obtain the convergent series solutions. Effects of varied arising parameters on involved distributions are reflected through graphical illustrations. From this study, it is perceived that strong magnetic field hinders the fluid motion and lead to rise in temperature that eventually lowers heat transfer rate from the surface. Further, decrease in heat transfer rate is also observed for enhanced values of thermal radiation parameter. Validation of presented results is done by comparing them with an already published paper and excellent consensus is achieved; thus trustworthy results are being presented.
48	<strong>Charge Transfer Dynamical Processes at Graphene-Transition Metal Oxides/Electrolyte Interface for Energy Storage: Insights from In-Situ Raman Spectroelectrochemistry</strong>	Electrochemical assembled hybrids consisting of two-dimensional supercapacitive functionalized graphene (graphene oxide; GO reduced graphene oxide; rGO multilayer graphene; MLG, electrochemically reduced GO; ErGO) and three-dimensional graphene scaffold (rGO<sub>HT</sub>; hydrothermally prepared) decorated with pseudocapacitive cobalt nanoparticles (CoNP), nanostructured cobalt oxide (CoO and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) and manganese oxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>) polymorphs, were prepared to facilitate chemically bridged interfaces with tunable properties. Since Raman spectroscopy can capture various spectral features, variations in chemical structural bonding, in-situ Raman spectroelectrochemistry is employed (1) to probe dynamical interfacial processes, (2) to monitor and quantify the spectral changes with successive redox reactions, and (3) to quantify the associated parameters including electron transfer properties. Raman spectroscopy can capture variations in structural bonding of &lsquo;hybrid&rsquo; electrodes in aqueous electrolytes with applied bias. The transverse optical (TO) and longitudinal optical (LO) phonons above 500 cm<sup>&minus;</sup><sup>1</sup> belonging to Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, CoO and MnO<sub>2</sub> and carbon-carbon bonding (D, G, and 2D) bands occurring at 1340 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 1590 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> and 2670 cm<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, are analyzed. Consistent quasi-reversible variation in Raman intensity and band position reveal structural modification, combination of charge transfer due to localized orbital re-hybridization and mechanical strain resulting in finely tuned electronic properties. Moreover, the heterogeneous basal and edge plane sites of graphene hybrids reinforce efficient interfacial electron transfer and available electronic density of states for enhanced performance. We estimated the extent and nature of charge transfer (n- or p-) complemented with Density Functional Theory calculations affected by hydration and demonstrating the synergistic coupling between graphene, cobalt (and manganese) oxide polymorphs for energy storage.
49	Freestanding Triboelectric-Structure based Three-Dimensional Spherical Nanogenerator	In this paper, we report a three-dimensional spherical triboelectric nanogenerator based on freestanding triboelectric-structure (FS-TENG) for converting full space mechanical energy into electric energy, which consists of freestanding polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) balls, a transparent spherical shell and aluminum conductive layers attached to the inner surface of the spherical shell. On the basis of the coupling of triboelectric and electrostatic effects, the potential difference between the conjugated aluminum electrodes is generated, can efficiently harvest the full space mechanical energy in all directions. The as-fabricated FS-TENG can deliver a maximal output voltage up to 120 V, and an instantaneous current of 0.4 &#x03BC;A, and a corresponding output power of 48 &#x03BC;W, which can be used to directly drive tens of blue light-emitting diodes. This study proves the possibility to harvest mechanical energy by FS-TENG from all directions for applications such as self-powered vibration sensors.
50	Plane shock loading on mono- and nano-crystalline silicon carbide	The understanding of the nanoscale mechanisms of shock damage and failure in SiC is essential for its application in effective and damage tolerant coatings. We use molecular-dynamics simulations to investigate the shock properties of 3C-SiC along low-index crystallographic directions and in nanocrystalline samples with 5 nm and 10 nm grain size. The predicted Hugoniot in the particle velocities range 0.1 km/s - 6.0 km/s agree well with experimental data. The shock response transitions from elastic to plastic, predominantly deformation twinning, to structural transformation to the rock-salt phase. Predicted strengths from 12.3 to 30.9 GPa, at the Hugoniot elastic limit, are in excellent agreement with experimental data.
51	Inter-layer and Intra-layer Heat Transfer in Bilayer/Monolayer Graphene van der Waals Heterostructure: Is There a Kapitza Resistance Analogous?	Van der Waals heterostructures have exhibited interesting physicalproperties. In this paper, heat transfer in hybrid coplanar bilayer/monolayer(BL-ML) graphene, as a model layered van der Waals heterostructure, was studiedusing non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Temperature profileand inter- and intra-layer heat fluxes of the BL-ML graphene indicated that,there is no fully developed thermal equilibrium between layers and the drop inaverage temperature profile at the step-like BL-ML interface is notattributable to the effect of Kapitza resistance. By increasing the length ofthe system up to 1 $\mu$m in the studied MD simulations, the thermallynon-equilibrium region was reduced to a small area near the step-likeinterface. All MD results were compared to a continuum model and a good matchwas observed between the two approaches. Our results provide a usefulunderstanding of heat transfer in nano- and micro-scale layered 2D materialsand van der Waals heterostructures.
52	<strong>MHD natural convection and thermal radiation of micropolar nanofluid within a porous enclosure including elliptic heater utilizing KKL model</strong>	This work studies the natural convection heat transfer and thermal radiation of micropolar nanofluid within a porous cavity under the effects of uniform magnetic field and internal elliptic heater taking into account the single-phase nanofluid approach, local thermal equilibrium model and Darcy law for the transport processes inside a porous medium. The Galerkin finite element method with the structured non-uniform grid is used to solve the formulated non-linear equations. The governing parameters are Darcy&ndash;Rayleigh number <em>Ra</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10&ndash;1000, porosity <em>&epsilon;</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.1&ndash;0.9, Darcy number <em>Da</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10<sup>&ndash;5</sup>&ndash;10<sup>&ndash;1</sup>, radiation parameter <em>R<sub>d</sub></em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0&ndash;2, volume fraction of the nanoparticles <em>&phi;</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0&ndash;0.04, vortex viscosity parameter &Delta;&nbsp;=&nbsp;0&ndash;2, Hartmann number <em>Ha</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0&ndash;50. It has been revealed the heat transfer enhancement with thermal radiation parameter, Darcy&ndash;Rayleigh number, porosity and nanoparticles volume fraction.
53	<strong>Deep traps in nanodielectrics and their impact on charge transport</strong>	Nanodielectrics have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications as the improved dielectrics in high voltage direct current (HVDC) power transmission. One of the improved properties widely reported is the suppression of space charge in nanodielectrics when subject to higher DC electric fields. The proposed mechanism for the suppression in space charge is the introduction of deep traps due to the interaction between nanoparticles and polymer matrix. However, the supporting experimental results that lead to the deep trap formation are not rigorously examined. In this letter, a simple and more direct approach has been adopted based on the isothermal surface potential decay (ISPD) measurements to prove the presence of deep traps introduced by nanoparticles. The observed phenomenon also allows one to explain the mechanism of charge suppression in nanodielectrics.
54	Dynamics of electron-phonon coupling in bicontinuous nanoporous gold	The nano-size effect on electron-phonon interaction in free-electron noble metals has been a subject of intense discussion because of their important applications in physics, chemistry and biomedicine. However, the interference from supports of dispersive nanoparticulate metals has led to controversial observations. We utilize free-standing, bicontinuous nanoporous gold (NPG) films to investigate electron-phonon interaction dynamics using ultrafast MeV electron diffraction. Compared to solid gold films, NPG shows faster electron-phonon interaction and thus noticeably higher electron-phonon coupling constant. The results demonstrate that surface states of electrons and phonons play an important role in electron-phonon coupling of nanostructured materials.
55	Effect of Rise Time and Pulse Width on the Characteristic of Nanosecond Surface Dielectric Barrier Discharge Actuator	Nanosecond pulsed surface dielectric barrier discharge (ns-SDBD) actuator is a novel technology for active flow control due to its high control capability and low power consumption. In this paper, effects of pulse parameters on the ns-SDBD actuator with a two-electrode SDBD geometry structure are investigated. In particular, the electrical and optical characterizations of the ns-SDBD are investigated by changing the rise time and pulse width of the applied voltages. Experimental results show that short rise time leads to high current amplitude and diffuse-like plasma layer, while pulse width has slightly effect on the current amplitude and discharge uniformity. The deposited energy can reach up to the maximum at the rise time of 50 ns, whose value is 9.26 mJ, and then it slumps down, and finally decreases to a small value when the rise time increases from 150 ns to 500 ns. Whereas the longer pulse width deposit more energy on the surface of dielectric layer. Furthermore, the schlieren image shows the heat released by the ns-SDBD results in the generation of a circular arc wave and a plane wave. The intensity of the circular arc wave increases when the rise time decreases and the propagation distance of induced pressure wave in the vertical direction is approximately to linear growth. There is almost no change in the intensity of induced pressure waves under varying pulse width within the nanosecond range. However, two waves are produced while the pulse width is long enough. Vortex which finally develops into a jet is observed in a relatively long-time period after discharge. The vortex in schlieren picture is sharp and dark with long pulse due to the decrease of deposited energy and tangential acceleration ability.
56	<strong>Three-dimensional super-resolution correlation-differential confocal microscopy with nanometer axial focusing capability</strong>	We present a correlation-differential confocal microscopy (CDCM), a novel method that can simultaneously improve the three-dimensional spatial resolution and axial focusing capability of confocal microscopy (CM). CDCM divides the CM imaging light path into two paths, where the detectors are before and after the focus with an equal axial offset in opposite directions. Then, the light intensity signals received from the two paths are processed by the correlation product and differential subtraction to improve the CM spatial resolution and axial focusing capability, respectively. Theoretical analyses and preliminary experiments indicate that, for the excitation wavelength of &lambda; = 405 nm, numerical aperture of NA = 0.95, and the normalized axial offset of <em>u<sub>M</sub></em> = 5.21, the CDCM resolution is improved by 26.7% and 35.3% in the lateral and axial directions, respectively, compared with that of the CM. Also, the axial focusing resolution important for the imaging of sample surface profiles is improved to 1 nm.
57	<strong>Flow and heat transfer over a permeable bi-axial stretching/shrinking sheet in a nanofluid</strong>	This paper studies the bi-axial boundary layer flow of a nanofluid past a stretching/shrinking sheet. A suitable similarity transformation simplifies the system of partial differential equations into a system of ordinary differential equations. The obtained system of the governing ordinary differential equations is then solved numerically by using the bvp4c function from MATLAB. The generated numerical results are presented graphically and discussed in the relevance of the governing parameters. Dual solutions are found as the sheet is shrunk in the horizontal direction. Stability analysis shows that the first solution is physically realizable whereas the second solution is not practicable.
58	<strong>Hafnium Oxide Nanoparticles Fabricated by Femtosecond Laser Ablation in Water</strong>	We report the fabrication of colloidal hafnia (HfO<sub>2</sub>) nanoparticles (NPs) and nanoribbons in deionized water by femtosecond laser ablation. It is observed that the particle size and the density of nanoribbons increase with an increase in laser energy which was varied from 200 to 500 &micro;J in steps of 100 &micro;J. &nbsp;A pellet of sintered HfO<sub>2</sub> powder at 500<sup>0</sup> C was used for ablation process. The estimated average NPs size varied from 13.5 to 18.0 nm with varying input laser energy. The average nanoribbon size varied from 10 nm to 20 nm for all the laser energies. At lower input energies the generated NPs were observed to be in monoclinic phase (pure HfO<sub>2</sub>) while at higher input energies both monoclinic and hexagonal phases (pure HfO<sub>2</sub> and Hf<sub>6</sub>O) were observed. The structural variation is further confirmed by Selective Area Electron Diffraction, Raman and Grazing Incident X-Ray Diffraction measurements.

The morphological properties of the films were studied by scanning microscopy. The electric and photoelectrical properties of p-Si/Cd<sub>1-<em>x</em></sub>Zn<em><sub>x</sub></em>O heterojunctions and optical properties of Cd<sub>1-<em>x</em></sub>Zn<em><sub>x</sub></em>O films were investigated depending on the electrochemical deposition potential and films composition. It is found out that heterojunctions of p-Si/Cd<sub>1-<em>x</em></sub>Zn<em><sub>x</sub></em>O with nano-structured surface, which deposited at cathode potential of -1.2 V, shows good rectification (k&raquo;1640). Under AM1.5 conditions (W = 100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) the maximal values of open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, fill factor and efficiency of our best nano-structured cell, were <em>U</em><sub>oc </sub>= 442&nbsp;mV, <em>J</em><sub>sc </sub>= 19.9&nbsp;mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, <em>ff</em> = 0.59 and h = 5.1 %, respectively.

First-performed neutron powder diffraction investigation of <em>P</em> and <em>Pr</em> samples<sub> </sub>of KDP:Ti<sup>4+</sup> crystal allowed to reveal<sub> </sub>vacancies in the K and H sites for both samples, their number being larger in the <em>Pr</em> structure compared to the <em>P</em> one. Taking into account a deficiency of the K and H sites, full occupation of the O site, presence of Ti<sup>4+</sup> ions in the structure, and the electroneutrality condition, a partial substitution of (PO<sub>4</sub>)<sup>3-</sup> anion by (SO<sub>4</sub>)<sup>2-</sup> one, larger for the <em>Pr</em> sample, was observed. The real compositions of <em>P</em> and <em>Pr</em> samples, correlated with the cation-anion internuclear distances, were refined. The dielectric permittivity of the <em>Pr</em> sample was significantly lower than that of the <em>P</em> one; it decreases with the decreasing &#x041A;&ndash;&#x041E;, &#x0420;&ndash;&#x041E;, and &#x041E;&middot;&middot;&middot;&#x041D; distances and increasing deficiency of the K and H sites.

62	Vapor-deposited octadecanethiol masking layer on copper to enable Area Selective HfNx ALD on dielectrics studied by in-situ spectroscopic ellipsometry	Area-selective atomic layer deposition (AS-ALD) has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years for self-aligned accurate pattern placement with sub-nanometer thickness control. We demonstrate a methodology to achieve AS-ALD by using undecanethiol and octadecanethiol masking layers deposited selectively in vapor phase on copper vs. low-&#x03BA;. Our approach has been demonstrated in combination with an in-situ HfNx ALD. In-situ spectroscopic ellipsometer was performed to investigate the blocking ability of the thiols on the copper surface against ALD nucleation. A considerable growth inhibition up to 480 cycles for HfNx deposited at 170&#x00BA;C has been observed on the copper surface, while the same functionalization did not inhibit the nucleation on the dielectric surfaces.
63	Reversal time of jump-noise driven magnetization dynamics in nanomagnets via Monte Carlo simulations	The jump-noise is a nonhomogeneous Poisson process which models thermal e&#xFB00;ects in magnetization dynamics, with special applications in low temperature escape rate phenomena. In this work, we develop improved numerical methods for Monte Carlo simulation of jump-noise dynamics, and validate the method by comparing the stationary distribution obtained numerically against the analytic Boltzmann distribution. In accordance with the Ne&eacute;l-Brown theory, jump-noise dynamics display an exponential relaxation toward equilibrium with a characteristic reversal time, which we extract for nanomagnets with uniaxial and cubic anisotropy. We also identify an analytic upper bound on the strength of jump-noise: this bound establishes the regime of small noise in which an equivalent Gilbert damping coe&#xFB03;cient can be de&#xFB01;ned within the classical framework of magnetization dynamics.
64	Energy transfer between molecules in the presence of a graphene-coated plasmonic nanoshell	In this study&lrm;, &lrm;we investigate the transfer of energy from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule close a spherical multilayer nanoparticle consisting of a core surrounded by two shells. We obtain general expression for the interaction energy in a hybrid plasmonic nanoshell-molecular system by considering the role of dipolar, quadrupolar&lrm;, &lrm;octupolar&lrm;, &lrm;hexadecapolar&lrm;, &lrm;triakontadipolar plasmonic modes. &lrm;Owing to high tunability of multishell nanoparticles, the resonance energy transfer can be enhanced and strongly tuned by adjusting and controlling the size of core and the thickness of shells. Also, the impact of graphene-coated multilayer spherical nanoparticles on the energy transfer from donor to acceptor molecules is studied, because by covering nanoparticles in graphene it becomes possible to achieve tunable nanophotonic and graphene nanoplasmonics devices. It is found that this kind of nanostructures can provide high intermolecular sensitivity of the resonant energy, which is important for some applications such as biosensing and molecular dynamics.&lrm;
65	Controlled Synthesis of 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Heterostructures and Alloys	The advent of two-dimensional (2D) materials and van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures has been a boon for the nanoscience community, enabling the fabrication of nanostructures with atomic-scale precision, resulting in high performance opto-electronic devices. Yet, while vdW heterostructures have been widely studied, their fabrication remains rudimentary, relying upon physical stacking and <em>ad hoc </em>collections of recipes, rather than a rational framework. Here, we report our work on the synthesis of a collection of vdW heterostructures and monolayer alloys of the 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and the creation of a unifying, diagrammatic approach to heterostructure growth, which we call Time-Temperature-Architecture (TTA) diagrams. We demonstrate the temperature tunable synthesis of in-plane, vertical, and hybrid heterostructures, as well as monolayer alloys within the MoS<sub>2</sub>-WS<sub>2</sub> and MoSe<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub> systems. We use the TTA framework to add previously unexplored entries to this collection: the first ever single-step growth of MoSe<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub> vertical heterostructures and Mo<em><sub>1-x</sub></em>W<em><sub>x</sub></em>Se<sub>2</sub> alloys, and a new hybrid architecture that combines the morphologies of both vertical and in-plane heterostructures. The TTA diagrams are a simple framework for vdW heterostructure and alloy growth, representing a novel nano-modular synthesis platform, which we believe may be a crucial enabler of capitalization of TMD heterostructures&rsquo; emergent properties.
66	Space charge mitigation effect on dielectric breakdown in polyimide nanocomposites through trap density enhancement	From a novel empirical power law between the DC breakdown field and the DC conductivity, an analysis of the trapping characteristics in polyimide/boron nitride (PI/BN) nanocomposites is presented based on space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements. The impact of the total trap density <em>H<sub>t</sub></em> enhancement (up to 1.1&times;10<sup>17</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>) induced by the BN nanoparticles on the space charge mitigation, the DC conductivity reduction and the DC breakdown field increase is clearly reported. This work proves that an efficient control of the trapping parameters allows huge enhancement of the insulating properties of PI films.
67	<strong>Enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting of BiVO<sub>4</sub> photonic crystal photoanode by decorating with MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets</strong>	Bismuth vanadate (BiVO<sub>4</sub>) has been considered as one of the promising Photoelectrochemical (PEC) photoanode materials. However, the performances remain poorly rated due to inefficient carries separation, short carrier diffusion length and sluggish water oxidation kinetic. Herein, a photoanode consisted of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets coating on the three-dimensional ordered BiVO<sub>4</sub> inverse opal is fabricated by a facile combination of nanosphere lithography and hydrothermal methods. By taking the advantage of the photonic crystal and two-dimensional material, the optimized MoS<sub>2</sub>/BiVO<sub>4</sub> inverse opal photoanode exhibits a 560% improvement of the photocurrent density and threefold enhancement of the incident photon-to-current efficiency than that of the pristine BiVO<sub>4 </sub>film photoanode. Systematic studies reveal that the excellent PEC activity should be attributed from enhanced light harvesting and charge separation efficiency.
68	Environmentally friendly nanofabrication of ultra-low reflectivity black silicon photovoltaics by high density inductively coupled plasmas	Photovoltaics (PV) as a renewable source of energy has received renewed interest in the immediate provision of sustainable energy to meet market demand in recent years. A key challenge in clean energy research is to ensure that the technology not only provides a sustainable energy source during device operation, butis also environmentally sustainable during the manufacturing phase of the device lifecycle. Plasma sources have been conventionally employed in numerous PV processes due to highly controllable process parameters that enable precise control of material properties at the nanoscale. However, these processes usually employ toxic feedstocks as a means to obtain favourable PV characteristics, such as nanotexturing. In this work, an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) system was employed for fabrication of highly efficient nanotextured PV cells. A 2-step process was developed to use a high density N<sub>2</sub> discharge for high density plasma immersion ion implantation (HD-PIII) in group V doping of c-Si samples for high quality junction formation. Subsequently, an Ar + H<sub>2</sub> discharge was utilized for the simultaneous nanotexturing of the surface as well as passivation of surface defects through intense hydrogenation from the plasma generated radical flux. The resulting black silicon (b-Si) PV cells fabricated through this process typically has ultra-low reflectance of &lt; 1.8 %, V<sub>oc</sub> of ~ 540 mV, and J<sub>sc</sub> of ~ 24 mA&times;cm<sup>-2</sup>. In-situ plasma diagnostics were also performed to enable a truly deterministic method for obtaining optimal material properties based on plasma parameters instead of process parameters, which may vary for different reactor geometries.
69	<strong>Probing of interface optical phonon modes in AlGaN multi-quantum wells using tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy</strong>	Group III nitride based 2D multi-quantum well (MQW) nanostructures find remarkable applications in the visible to ultraviolet light sources. The interface (IF) optical phonon modes in a superlattice of [Al<em><sub>0.35</sub></em>Ga<em><sub>0.65</sub></em>N (~1.75 nm)/Al<em><sub>0.55</sub></em>Ga<em><sub>0.45</sub></em>N (~2 nm)]<sub>20 </sub>MQWs using tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is reported. The far-field (without TERS probe) and near-field, with TERS probe decorated by Au spherical nanoparticle of ~ 200 nm&nbsp;diameter, measurements were carried out at ambient conditions using the scanning probe microscope coupled with the laser Raman spectrometer showing enhancement in the Raman intensities in the later.&nbsp; The IF phonon mode belonging to <em>E</em><sub>1</sub> symmetry [IF(<em>E</em><sub>1</sub>)]&nbsp; beating normal to the <em>c</em>-axis of MQWs appeared to be more prominent in the case of TERS measurement compared to that of other optical phonon modes. The confined electric field of the electro-magnetic excitation using vertically polarized laser source parallel to the plane of the film using TERS probe is made responsible for the plasmonic enhancement of IF(<em>E</em><sub>1</sub>) phonon mode.
70	<strong>Electronic and Mechanical properties of doped W-Re nanostructues &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash; A DFT study</strong>	The electronic and mechanical properties of Tungsten (W), Re doped W (W-Re), La doped W-Re and Cu doped W-Re nanostructures were explored using density functional theory (DFT). The electronic properties were studied in terms of density of states spectrum. For exploring mechanical properties, elastic constants, Young&rsquo;s modulus, Bulk modulus and Shear modulus are observed. Furthermore, the ductility and hardness of the nanostructures are also studied at the atomistic level. The results reveal that W<sub>0.81</sub>Re<sub>0.14</sub>Cu<sub>0.05 </sub>nanostructures show the best combination when compared to factors like ductility and Young&rsquo;s modulus.
71	MD simulation and nanoindentation study of thermally annealed glassy Ni-Zr alloy thin films	Thin films of Ni-Zr glassy alloy (Ni78Zr22) were deposited at room temperature by D.C. magnetron co-sputtering from individual high purity Ni and Zr targets. The alloy films were vacuum annealed in steps of 200 {degree sign}C up to 800 {degree sign}C; where devitrification was observed to occur through grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements. Thin films of metallic glass are known to exhibit useful mechanical properties, which can vary significantly with the structure of the film; influenced through thermal annealing. Tuning of these mechanical properties are of particular interest to engender suitability of glassy films for various technological applications. Mechanical properties of Ni-Zr glassy alloy thin films were measured after each thermal anneal, through nanoindentation technique. The hardness values thus obtained were observed to steadily increase with annealing temperature, as the alloy films underwent an amorphous to crystalline transformation. The resistance of the soft as-deposited and hard annealed films to plastic deformation were obvious from a comparison of GIXRD patterns before and after nanoindentation. The results of a rising trend of hardness with temperature could be adequately supported through Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations of the nanoindentation process applied to a thermally annealed Ni78Zr22 film. The resultant  variation in elastic moduli of this alloy film with annealing could also be gauged. Moreover through MD simulations, properties of high hardness and low brittleness of the crystalline annealed film could be established. This is a desirable combination for many practical uses which require the film material to withstand deformation and be sufficiently wear resistant. Studies on structure-property relationships in thin film metallic glasses are important to recognize how best to tune their properties to suit specific applications.
72	<strong>Magneto Jeffrey nanofluid bioconvection over a rotating vertical cone due to gyrotactic</strong><strong> microorganism</strong>	The particular inquiry is made to envision the behavioral characteristics of gyrotactic microorganism effects on the MHD flow of Jeffrey nanofluid. Together the nanoparticles and motile microorganism are inducted into the modeled non-linear differential equations. The optimal solutions for the governing equations are tackled by Optimal Homotopy Analysis Method. The physical characteristics of the relatable parameters are explored and deliberated in the terms of graphs and numerical charts. Also, the precision of the present findings is certified by equating them with the previously published work.
73	XRD analysis of sol-gel prepared nanoparticles of &#x03B1;-alumina using aqueous and non-aqueous sols: A mathematical approach	Nanoparticles of &#x03B1;-alumina were prepared by aqueous and non-aqueous sols using aluminium isopropoxide as a precursor dissolved in distilled water and propanol respectively at calcination temperatures of 1100&#x1D52;C and 1200&#x1D52;C. The synthesized &#x03B1;-alumina nanoparticles were characterized by XRD and TEM. XRD and TEM revealed that the nanoparticles were highly crystalline. TEM image shows uniform and spherical structure having an average crystallite size of 30nm. The crystallite size and microstrain was evaluated using X-ray diffraction line profiles (XRDLP) by applying Williamson-Hall method for both isotropic and anisotropic behaviour of the crystallite. The other physical parameters such as Young's modulus, stress and energy density were calculated using uniform deformation model (UDM), uniform deformation stress model (UDSM) and uniform deformation energy density model (UDEDM). The Williamson-Hall analysis results were discussed with the obtained results of Scherrer's analysis and TEM images.
74	Doubly stratified MHD squeezing flow of convectively heated Maxwell nano-fluid	This article is made to discuss the effect of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) on squeezing flow of the nanoparticles between two confined boundaries. Constitutive expressions are utilized for convectively heated Maxwell nano-fluid using Buongiorno's model in the mathematical development of considered flow problem. Here system of transport equations incorporates the combined effects of thermophoresis diffusion, Brownian diffusion and double stratification. Coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations are transformed by employing suitable similar transformations. The formulated non-linear system is evaluated successfully via convergent approach. The graphical analysis is carried out for different active physical flow parameters. Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are also treated graphically. The results portray that the velocity profile is increasing function of material parameter in the region 0{less than or equal to}&#x03B7;<0.5 while it shows reverse behavior in the domain0.5<&#x03B7;{less than or equal to}1.0. Further there is no variation in the flow velocity at &#x03B7;=0. Moreover, for larger values of Biot number, convective effects dominant on plate surface and help the temperature and nanoparticle concentration to increase rapidly near the surface.
75	<strong>Magnetic nanoparticle in a rotating magnetic field</strong>	The article describes the conditions needed to meet the parameters of magnetite nanoparticles, the liquid medium and the magnetic field required in the phenomenon of magnetic hyperthermia with a rotating magnetic field. The minimum amplitude of the magnetic field intensity was theoretically determined and the thermal power released by the rotating spheres in the viscous medium was estimated. The estimates were based on the assumption that the magnetic relaxation times meet the condition:<em>t</em><sub>N</sub>&gt;&gt;<em>t</em><sub>B</sub>. The general construction of apparatus generating a rotating magnetic field is described. Experimental research was carried out with the use of an oil-based magnetic liquid with magnetite particles with a magnetic core diameter <em>d</em><sub>m</sub> = 11.8 nm. The specific absorption rate (<em>SAR</em>) value was determined in the experiment and the amplitude of the magnetic field intensity required in the medical &nbsp;therapy for a given magnetic fluid and for the frequency <em>f</em> = 41.9 kHz should be determined.
76	Advanced photonic filters based on cascaded Sagnac loop reflector resonators in silicon-on-insulator nanowires	We demonstrate advanced integrated photonic filters in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) nanowires implemented by cascaded Sagnac loop reflector (CSLR) resonators. We investigate mode splitting in these standing-wave (SW) resonators and demonstrate its use for engineering the spectral profile of on-chip photonic filters. By changing the reflectivity of the Sagnac loop reflectors (SLRs) and the phase shifts along the connecting waveguides, we tailor mode splitting in the CSLR resonators to achieve a wide range of filter shapes for diverse applications including enhanced light trapping, flat-top filtering, Q factor enhancement, and signal reshaping. We present the theoretical designs and compare the CSLR resonators with three, four, and eight SLRs fabricated in SOI. We achieve versatile filter shapes in the measured transmission spectra via diverse mode splitting that agree well with theory. This work confirms the effectiveness of using CSLR resonators as integrated multi-functional SW filters for flexible spectral engineering.
77	<strong>Half-metallicity in Tetrapyrroles Modified Graphene Nanoribbons</strong>	We predict existence of the half-metallicity in porphin modified graphene nanoribbons based on first-principle density functional theory calculations. The porphin modified graphene nanoribbons are constituted by coupling porphin molecules to the graphene nanoribbons in one side based on the recent experiment (Y. He et al., Nat. Chem., 2017, 9, 33&ndash;38). We found that the porphin modified zigzag graphene nanoribbons exhibit half-metallicity, and their band gaps are fixed at about 0.3eV for the spin-up channel regardless the variation of graphene width and porphin modified densities. For the armchair graphene nanoribbons, porphin modification will influence their band gaps and break up the original rules of 3n+1. These findings open a new avenue to the graphene based electronic and spintronic devices.
78	SPR-Enhanced Fluorescence and Protein-Improved Blood Compatibility of Quadruple Core/Shell Nanostructure of Ag@SiO2@Eu3+(tta)3Phen@Protein	This study presents a quadruple core/shell nanostructures of Ag@SiO2@Eu3+(tta)3Phen@protein with both excellent fluorescent property and blood compatibility. In this quadruple nanostructure, surface-plasma resonance (SPR) was utilized to enhance the fluorescence of europium (Eu3+) complexes. In this situation, the fluorescence of Eu3+(tta)3Phen in the triple Ag@SiO2@Eu3+(tta)3Phen nanostructure is greatly enhanced. In order to increase the biocompatibility in blood, lysozyme was used to modify the surface of above triple nano-structure to get the quadruple nanostructure of Ag@SiO2@Eu3+(tta)3Phen@lysozyme. Then, through the clinical anti-coagulation tests of this quadruple nanostructure in human blood, the blood compatibility of Ag@SiO2@Eu3+(tta)3Phen@lysozyme is largely improved comparing with the triple nanostructure of Ag@SiO2@Eu3+(tta)3Phen, and the values of PT-S, APTT-S, TT-S, and AT-III of quadruple nanostructure blood sample with the modification of protein have the high correlation coefficients, 0.993 to 0.994, which means that the quadruple nanostructure of Ag@SiO2@Eu3+(tta)3Phen@lysozyme is close to the anti-coagulation property of physiological saline state (0.9% NaCl aqueous solution). Thus, this work provides two key properties of the quadruple nanostructure of Ag@SiO2@Eu3+(tta)3Phen@lysozyme: the excellent fluorescence and the excellent blood compatibility. This nanomaterial can be applied to bio-imaging and bio-sensing in blood.
79	Fractal superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors with reduced polarization sensitivity	We demonstrate the superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) based on a fractal design of the nanowires to reduce the polarization sensitivity of detection efficiency. We patterned niobium-titanium-nitride thin films into Peano curves with a line width of 100 nm and integrated the nanowires with optical micro-cavities to enhance their optical absorption. At the base temperature of 2.6 K, the fractal SNSPD exhibited a polarization-maximum device efficiency of 67% and a polarization-minimum device efficiency of 61%, at the wavelength of 1550 nm. Therefore, the polarization sensitivity, defined as their ratio, was 1.1, lower than the polarization sensitivity of the SNSPDs in the meander design. The reduced polarization sensitivity of the detector could be maintained for higher-order spatial modes in multi-mode optical fibers and could tolerate misalignment between the optical mode and the detector. This fractal design is applicable to both amorphous and polycrystalline materials that are commonly used for making SNSPDs.
80	<strong>Plasmonic nanobump-assembled platform for absorption enhancement of upconversion materials</strong>	We numerically investigate a plasmonic nanobump and upconversion (UC) layer incorporated metal&ndash;insulator&ndash;metal (MIM) platform as a light absorber. The hemispherical nanobump array situated over a substrate can serve as an optical nanoantenna in a broadband wavelength range. By precisely engineering the design and optical parameters of the insulating spacer layer sandwiched by the top nanobumps and back reflecting metal film, we can manipulate the light absorption inside the upconversion layer. The optical near-field distribution of the nanobump-assembled plasmonic platform is studied using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to probe the origin of enhanced absorption within the thin UC layer. A suggested mathematical model considering plasmonic and quenching effects of the MIM configuration to analyze the near-field maximum as a function of an insulator thickness is in good agreement with the FDTD result.&nbsp; The 30-fold enhanced light absorption within the UC layer is observed for the MIM plasmonic platform compared to the reference sample. Well-established optical field confinement at the nanoscale gap and excitation of surface plasmons (SPs) near the nanobumps can be attributed to increased light absorption inside the plasmonic MIM platform. The plasmonic nanobump array platform can be an alternative strategy to apply a highly efficient light absorber to an UC device.
81	<strong>Optical properties of wurtzite silicon nanowires: A promising material for optoelectronic applications</strong>	Wurtzite silicon has exhibited a wealth of interesting properties but known to have PL at room temperature. Several researchers have reported the limitations of diamond cubic silicon in the area of optoelectronic devices due to its indirect band gap. Therefore, different phases of silicon are investigated worldwide for the substitute of diamond silicon to overcome its limitation. Recently, wurtzite silicon nanowires (w-SiNWs) have suggested as a potential material for optoelectronic applications. Therefore, optical properties of the w-SiNWs are investigated here. The w-SiNWs are synthesized using top down fabrication method. Presence of the w-SiNWs is confirmed by first-order and second-order Raman spectra. Furthermore, observed second-order Raman active optical modes and acoustic modes of w-SiNWs are analyzed using phonon dispersion curve of wurtzite silicon. Absorption coefficient of SiNWs is remarkably enhanced due to phase transformation from diamond structure to wurtzite structure. Moreover, greenish-yellow photoluminescence (PL) is observed here from w-SiNWs.
82	<strong>Investigation of corrugated channel performance with different wave shapes: Nanofluid as working media</strong>	A two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (2-D CFD) study on turbulent forced convection of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-water nanofluid flow inside the heated corrugated channel is carried out. The mixture model, which has been verified to be the appropriate model to simulate nanofluids behavior, is employed to model nanofluids, and the governing equations are solved by means of finite volume method (FVM). The effects of wave shape (triangular, trapezoidal, and sinusoidal), phase shift (0, <em>&pi;</em>/2, and <em>&pi;</em>), nanoparticle volume fraction (0 to 4%), and Reynolds number (6,000 to 22,000) on the thermal-hydraulic performance of the corrugated channel are investigated. The results indicate, while the trapezoidal corrugated channel has the highest values of Nusselt number, the sinusoidal corrugated channel offers the optimum performance. Based on the considered performance evaluation criterion (PEC), the lower phase shifts present a better thermal-hydraulic performance (higher PEC). Also, the rate of heat transfer and PEC values enhance with the increase in Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticle volume fraction. Finally, correlations are proposed to predict Nusselt number and friction factor of the water and nanofluids flows in the corrugated channel.
83	<strong>Low temperature synthesis of complex solid solution (1-x)Bi<sub>0.5</sub>Na<sub>0.5</sub>TiO<sub>3</sub>&ndash;xBaTiO<sub>3 </sub>system: BT induced structural and dielectric anomalies in NBT</strong>	(1-x)Bi<sub>0.5</sub>Na<sub>0.5</sub>TiO<sub>3</sub>&ndash;xBaTiO<sub>3</sub> (NBT-BT) complex solid solutions with different composition of BT (x = 0 &ndash; 0.08, Dx = 0.02) were synthesized by low temperature hydrothermal-combustion route. BT-induced structural distortion in NBT are analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy (RS) studies. XRD result confirms the presence of morphotrophic phase boundary (MPB) by co-existence of (202) rhombohedral peak and (002)/(200) tetragonal peaks at x = 0.06. However, arisen of new vibration modes at A-site and splitting of bands at B sites at the MPB region are revealed by RS study. Microstructural features of as-developed NBT-BT system exhibit rod-like and cuboid-shape mixed morphology; however BT is found inhibiting grain growth of NBT. The broadening of the dielectric peak with deviation from Curie&ndash;Weiss law proves the dielectric dispersion near the MPB region of NBT&ndash;BT. BT in NBT causes enhancement in remnant polarization (P<sub>r</sub>), suppression in coercive field (E<sub>c</sub>) with giant strain (0.27%) at MPB region. Study exhibits potential of nanostructure NBT-BT system to be used as actuators.
84	<strong>A novel fabrication method of two-photon luminescent organic nano-architectures using electron-beam irradiation</strong>	Optical recording on organic thin films with a high spatial resolution is promising for high-density optical memories, optical computing, and security purposes. The spatial resolution of the optical recording is limited by the diffraction of light. Electrons can be focused to a nanometer-sized spot, providing the potential for achieving better resolution. In conventional electron-beam lithography, however, optical tuning of the fabricated structures is limited mostly to metals and semiconductors rather than organic materials. In this article, we report a novel fabrication method of luminescent organic architectures using a focused electron beam. We optimized the fabrication conditions of the electron beam to generate chemical species showing visible photoluminescence via two-photon near-infrared excitations. We utilized this fabrication method to draw nanoscale optical architectures on a polystyrene thin film.
85	Saturable absorption by carbon nanotubes on silica microtoroids<strong> </strong>	Saturable absorption is a key technology for shaping the waveform of light such as in passive mode-locking. The combination of high-<em>Q</em> optical microcavities with a saturable absorber allows stable lasing and soliton formation. This work describes saturable absorption by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on silica microtoroids. CNTs, which are saturable absorbers capable of a fast response time and broadband absorption, were grown on silica microtoroids by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Raman spectroscopy revealed that the CNTs are in good quality (G/D ratio ~7) and about 1.0 nm in diameter, thus confirming that a sample for use in the telecommunication band can be prepared by CVD. A counter-propagating pump-probe experiment enabled us to investigate the characteristics of CNTs as saturable absorbers while suppressing thermo-optic bistability in a microcavity system. The results revealed a saturable absorption coefficient of 0.042&nbsp;cm<sup>-1</sup>, a saturable intensity of 25.9&nbsp;MW/cm<sup>2</sup>, and a modulation depth of 28%. This is the first step toward the demonstration of the robust mode-locking in a silica microtoroid consisting of CNTs.
86	<strong>Pulsed photo-ionization spectroscopy of traps in as-grown and neutron irradiated ammonothermally synthesized GaN</strong>	GaN-based structures are promising materials in applications for production of radiation&nbsp;&nbsp; detectors and high-voltage high-frequency devices. In this work, the wafer pieces of the GaN grown by ammonothermal technology have been studied to reveal the dominant defects introduced by growth procedures and reactor neutron irradiations in a wide range 10<sup>12</sup> - 5&times;10<sup>16</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> of fluences.&nbsp; Several defects in the as-grown and in the irradiated material have been revealed by using the pulsed photo-ionization spectroscopy (PPIS) technique. The PPIS measurements have been performed by combining femtosecond (40 fs) and nanosecond (4 ns) laser pulses emitted by optical parametric oscillators to clarify the role of electron-phonon coupling.
87	<strong>Nickel-doped ferrite nanoparticles substituted in fiber optic clad Structure: A modified magnetic fluid to enhance magnetic sensory </strong>	A simple structure of wide-range magnetic field sensor is proposed and experimentally established using a tapered polymer optical fiber (POF) coated with Nickel &ndash;doped magnetic fluid (MF) containing ferrite nanoparticles formulated as &nbsp; for x=0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 suspended in ester. The proposed sensor functions based on intensity modulation of the evanescent field technique, i.e. the sensory manner is as a result of exposing the evanescent field from the clad region of the optical fiber to the surrounding environment. The middle segment of &nbsp;&nbsp;the POF was tapered with the waist diameter of 0.5 mm and tapering length of 10 mm and then surrounded with MF. The coated MF around this segment provides the sensitivity for the proposed sensor as it modifies the effective refractive index of the cladding corresponding to the applied magnetic field and consequently offers a keen method for magnetic sensing. In order to evaluate the best MF content influence on the sensing performance, four different samples of &nbsp; for x=0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5.&nbsp; were tested and the optimized ratio for the dopant is proposed. All the pure and doped ferrite samples were characterized by X-Ray Diffraction pattern (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Characteristic Results confirm that by doping Nickel cation in ferrite nanoparticle, the saturation magnetization increases from 65 emu/gr to 75 emu/gr, which enhances the sensory capability of the MF.
88	Laser-Induced Formation of Bismuth Nanoparticles	In the current letter, the synthesis of metallic Bi nanoparticles with coexisting crystallographic structures (rhombohedral, monoclinic, and cubic), obtained by direct femtosecond laser irradiation of NaBiO<sub>3</sub> is demonstrated for the first time. The procedure is performed under non-special ambient conditions, providing a pathway ahead to prototype and scale-up the manufacture of Bi-based nanomaterials. By exploring the use of high laser power values, it is revealed that the promoted laser-mediated reactions lead to the synthesis of coexisting phases in metal nanoparticles, which may be a widely occurring phenomenon in other materials under femtosecond laser irradiation.
89	Micromagnetic evaluation of the dissipated heat in cylindrical magnetic nanowires	Magnetic nanowires (NW) are promising candidates for heat generation under AC-field application due to their large shape anisotropy. They may be used for catalysis, hyperthermia or water purification treatments. In the present work we theoretically evaluate the heat dissipated by a single magnetic nanowire, originated from the domain wall dynamics under the action of an AC-field. We compare the Permalloy NWs (which demagnetize via the transverse wall propagation) with the Co fcc NWs whose reversal mode is via a vortex domain wall. The average hysteresis loop areas &ndash;which are proportional to the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR)&ndash; as a function of the field frequency have a pronounced maximum in the range 200MHz-1GHz. This maximum frequency is smaller in Permalloy than in Co and depends on the nanowire length. A simple model related to the nucleation and propagation time and domain wall velocity (higher for the vortex than for the transverse domain wall) is proposed to explain the non-monotonic SAR dependence on the frequency.
90	Magnetic flux-closure domains in high aspect ratio electroless-deposited CoNiB nanotubes	Magnetic azimuthal (flux-closure) domains in nanotubes could be interesting for data storage, sensors or spin waveguides with non-reciprocity of propagation induced by curvature. However, as expected from theory and recently confirmed experimentally, azimuthal domains could be found only in small aspect ratio tubes (large diameters or short lengths). Using magnetic X-ray microscopies, we show that electroless-plated CoNiB tubes can sustain series of azimuthal domains also for high aspect ratios thanks to an additional material-related magnetic anisotropy.  The anisotropy and thus the magnetic state can be tuned by annealing or adjusting the chemical composition to yield either azimuthal, or axial magnetization.
91	Mechanical properties and deformation behaviors of surface modified silicon: A molecular dynamic study	A fundamental knowledge of mechanical properties and deformation behaviors of surface modify silicon is necessary to explore for understanding remove mechanism during Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process. In this work, nanoindentation of monocrystalline silicon covered with an amorphous SiO2 film with different thickness is carried out by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. It is found that the calculated indentation modulus increases with the growing indentation depth for both pure and composite samples, while the modulus decreases with increasing film thickness at the same indentation depth. The derived hardness during indentation process, which is more sensitive to amorphous SiO2 film thickness, is complex due to deformation behaviors of SiO2 film. Its deformation behaviors consist of four periods during indentation process, containing densification, densification-rupture transition, rupture and unloading stages, which is verified by CN number of silicon atoms within SiO2 film and number of Si-O bond as a function of indentation depth. It is concluded that the SiO2 film servers as a media to dissipate the stress and transmit the stress from indenter to underlying silicon substrate and MD results show that the difference of phase distribution between pure and composite silicon at the same penetration depth is drove by the Von Mises stress.
92	Full-wave Theory Combined with Analytical Closed-form Expressions Applied to Whispering-Gallery-Mode Lasing of Fully Anisotropic Nanoparticles beyond Visible	A full-wave theory for the prediction of the complex whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) resonances beyond visible, of fully anisotropic nano/microresonators, is presented. The theory is based on the volume integral equation (VIE) method, supported by appropriate perturbation theory which enables analytical closed-form expressions valid for extremely large indices of the involved spherical wavefunctions. These closed-form expressions allow for the instant computation of the eigenbasis required for the solution of the VIE. The theory is applied to the calculation of WGM spectra of uniaxial semiconductor crystals beyond visible. Combined with a state-of-the-art open-source algorithm for complex roots computation, this theory constitutes a rigorous tool for the interpretation of experimental data obtained from photonic applications, including WGM lasing of fully anisotropic nanoresonators.
93	Morphological characterization of GaAs and AlAs islands grown on InGaAs by droplet epitaxy	In this work, we investigated the droplet epitaxy (DE) of Ga droplets and Al droplets son In0.53Ga0.47As lattice-matched to InP substrates via molecular beam epitaxy as a means to extract adatom diffusion information.  We previously demonstrated that In droplets on In0.53Ga0.47As form a central droplet surrounded by a thinner halo with radius directly related to the adatom diffusion length.  However, for Ga or Al droplets on In0.53Ga0.47As which are explored in this work, the morphology was significantly different.  We observed anisotropic mounds, etched tracks and pits, and quantum dot-like features.  To develop an understanding of the formation of these nanostructures, we explored various substrate temperatures, growth rates, and As-crystallization conditions.  While unexpected, this morphology could have implications toward interesting nanostructure formation, enabling drastically different morphologies than previously observed.  We extracted the Ga droplet density as a function of both growth rate and substrate temperature to estimate diffusion trends.  These results indicate that these Ga droplets still follow conventional nucleation trends for substrate temperatures below 500 {degree sign}C.  Furthermore, by comparing these results with our previous work with In droplets on In0.53Ga0.47As, we find that Ga adatoms diffuse slower than In adatoms on the In0.53Ga0.47As surface.
94	Development of effective stochastic potential method using random matrix theory for efficient conformational sampling of semiconductor nanoparticles at non-zero temperatures	The relationship between structure and property is central to chemistry, and enables the understanding of chemical phenomena and processes. Need for an efficient conformational sampling of chemical systems arises from the presence of solvents and the existence of non-zero temperatures. However, conformational sampling of structures to compute molecular quantum mechanical properties is computationally expensive because a large number of electronic structure calculations are required. In this work, the development and implementation of the effective stochastic potential (ESP) method is presented to perform efficient conformational sampling of molecules. The overarching goal of this work is to alleviate the computational bottleneck associated with performing a large number of electronic structure calculations required for conformational sampling.  sWe introduce the concept of a deformation potential and demonstrate its existence by the proof-by-construction approach. sA statistical description of the fluctuations in the deformation potential due to non-zero temperature was obtained using infinite-order moment expansion of the distribution.  The formal mathematical definition of the ESP was derived using functional minimization approach to smatch the infinite-order moment expansion for the deformation potential.  Practical implementation of the ESP was obtained using the random-matrix theory method. The developed method was applied to two proof-of-concept calculations of the distribution of HOMO-LUMO gap in water molecule and solvated CdSe clusters at 300K. The need for large sample size to obtain statistically meaningful results was demonstrated by performing 10<sup>5</sup> ESP calculations. The results from these prototype calculations demonstrated the efficacy of the ESP method for performing efficient conformational sampling. We envision that the fundamental nature of this work will not only extend our knowledge of chemical systems at non-zero temperatures but will also generate new insights for innovative technological applications.
95	Effect of the plasma channel velocity on the diode parameters during breakdown in a highly inhomogeneous electric field	Here, continuing our research in the breakdown of a gas diode with a highly inhomogeneous electric field, we present an analytical model which relates the diode current and voltage to the plasma channel velocity from cathode to anode in an axisymmetric statement. It is shown that the voltages cross- and lengthwise the diode can differ greatly and that the difference increases as the channel moves faster. This effect should be taken into account when analyzing subnanosecond pulsed breakdowns in a highly inhomogeneous electric, otherwise a large discrepancy is possible between measured and actual diode voltage. The analytical model is based on charge conservation laws and Lorentz transforms for electric field strengths and coordinates and is verified using the KARAT particle-in-cell (PIC) and xoopic particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo (PIC/MC) codes. The simulation results agree well with the analytical model developed.
96	Room temperature operable ammonia gas sensor based on nanostructured SnO2 synthesized by polyol technique	SnO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by low temperature polyol route and calcined at 700{degree sign}C. XRD studies confirmed the tetragonal phase and nanocrystalline nature of SnO2 particles. Gas sensors were fabricated by spin coating of SnO2 nanoparticles on gold interdigitated electrodes. The gas sensors showed high sensitivity, excellent selectivity and repeatability at room temperature for NH3. The high sensitivity and reversibility at room temperature of the nanostructured SnO2 sensor could be attributed to the intrinsically small particle size and high surface-to-volume ratio.
97	Energy spectrum and wave functions for a 1D quantum dot with strong spin-orbit coupling	For a semiconductor nanowire quantum dot with the confining potential modeled by both the infinite and the finite square wells, we exactly obtain the energy spectrum and the corresponding wave functions in the strong spin-orbit coupling regime. The energy levels in the quantum dot can be specified with respect to the $Z_{2}$ symmetry. There exists at least two bound states in the finite square, one has the $\sigma^{x}\mathcal{P}=-1$ symmetry and the other has the $\sigma^{x}\mathcal{P}=1$ symmetry. A strong enhancement of the spin-orbit effect is demonstrated by tuning the well height of the confining potential. Also, there exists a critical well height $V^{c}_{0}$, at which the spin-orbit effect is enhanced to maximal.

The basic partial differential equations include momentum and energy for this problem are reduced to the ordinary differential equations which are solved numerically by using finite element method (FEM) in the FlexPDE software package. For validity, the results is compared with 4th order Runge-Kutta numerical solution.

With rising the amount of Biot numbers, the dimensionless temperature decreases and dimensionless gradient temperature profiles increases. By increasing in nanoparticle fraction volume, the dimensionless temperature profiles of flow is increased and enhances the heat transfer coefficient. By increasing in nanoparticle fraction volume, the convection on walls increases within the channel. Also, with increasing in Eckert number, the dimensionless temperature profile increases and the convection inside the channel on upper wall decreases and on lower wall increases.</span>
99	Synthesis and Characterization of Novel TiO2/Cdse Core-Shell Nanoparticles by Surface Functionalization Route	In this work we report the synthesis of the Titanium dioxide/ Cadmium Selinide (TiO2/CdSe) core-shell (CS) nanoparticles. TiO2 nanoparticles are surface-functionalized using citric acid. These modified nanoparticles are then treated with aqueous solution of Cadmium chloride, CdCl2 and Sodium selenosulphate, Na2SeSO3 to obtain TiO2/CdSe core-shell nanoparticles. The effect of citric acid amount on the resulting structure was studied using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The optical properties and the shell growth were studied using by UV-Vis absorption spectra and photoluminescence (PL) spectra.
100	<strong>The Uniformity Analysis of NbN Nanowires Based on Element Mapping</strong>	Superconducting nanowire with super large ratio of length to width is the core component of superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD).The uniformity of these nanowires directly affects key parameters of SNSPD, like the detection efficiency, dark counts and time jitter. It is also a significant factor contributing to the uniformity and the product yield of final devices. In this letter, we have made Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) mapping and statistical analysis of NbN nanowires with different widths. Based on this, we established a method to evaluate the homogeneity of superconducting nanowires from the perspective of elemental distribution. With the help of AES element imaging, we drew the distribution images of N, Nb, Si and O on the nanowires. Based on graphic analysis, the uniformities of element distribution in both transverse and vertical dimensions were discussed, which can provide an intuitive criterion for optimizing the processing technique of SNSPD to improve the consistency and product yield.

102	Ultra-flexible transparent electrodes by embedding silver nanowires into polyimide thin films to achieve smooth surface, pronounced thermal stability, and strong adhesion	Silver nanowires (AgNWs) percolated films are considered as promising candidates for alternative transparent electrodes (TEs). However, due to their high surface roughness, poor adhesion and thermal stability, their use in TE application is still heavily limited. Herein, we report an ultra-flexible TE by imbedding AgNWs into polyimide (PI) to achieve smooth surface, pronounced thermal stability, and high adhesion. Besides the excellent electrical conductivity of about 7-13&#x03A9;/&#x25A1; in sheet resistance, the obtained AgNWs/PI films also have excellent transparency and mechanical resilience. The AgNWs/PI films show extraordinary stability in terms of electrical conductivity after arbitrary twisting and thermal heating test, respectively.
103	Multi-directional emission and detection of spin waves propagating in yttrium iron garnet with wavelengths down to about 100 nm	We performed broadband spin-wave spectroscopy on 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet containing arrays of partially embedded magnetic nanodisks. Using integrated coplanar waveguides (CPWs) we studied the excitation and transmission of spin waves depending on the presence of nanomagnet arrays of different lateral extensions. By means of the grating coupler effect we excited spin waves propagating in multiple lateral directions with wavelengths down to 111 nm. They exhibited group velocities of up to 1 km/s. Detection of such short-wavelength spin waves was possible only in symmetrically designed emitter/detector configurations, not with a bare CPW. The effective propagation distance amounted to several 10 &mu;m. We report spin waves propagating between grating couplers under oblique angles. This was not shown before and substantiates the versatility of the grating coupler effect when implementing nanomagnonic circuits.
104	<strong>Effect of the surface wettability changes on nanostructured polymer film for heat exchanger applications</strong>	Polymer heat exchangers have drawn attention due to their special characteristics such as flexibility, low weight, corrosion and bio-fouling resistance, as well as their ease of manufacturing. However, since their thermal conductivity is low, polymer heat exchangers require a way to increase their heat transfer rate. We investigated the effect of modifying the surface wettability of polymer films on the heat transfer rate during the condensation process, both theoretically and experimentally. Condensed water formation on the film surface depends on the surface wettability control, thus hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces can induce film-wise and drop-wise condensation of water, respectively. Generally, the polymer surface shows a hydrophobic property due to the intrinsic C-C and C-H bonding of polymer frames. Here, we used four different types of polymer films, which have different thermal conductivity and controlled wettability properties, including: polyimide film, polyimide film containing aluminum nanoparticles, and both films with super-hydrophobic treatment. The experimental results shows that nanostructured polymers with hydrophobic treatment have a 25% lower wetted area fraction than that without hydrophobic treatment, independent of the thermal conductivity of the polymer films. To compare the heat transfer rates for different samples, we designed a thermal resistance model considering vapor convection, vapor-water interfaces and curvatures, and conductions of the droplet, nanostructure, and polymer. Through a theoretical approach, we found that the convective thermal resistance dominantly affects the heat transfer rate and treated polymers showed a 200% higher total heat transfer than bare polymer.
105	Structural evolution and electrical properties of carbon ion implanted ultrananocrystalline diamond films	We have investigated the structural evolution and electrical properties of carbon ion implanted ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) films. The results show that both nanocrystalline diamond grains and amorphous carbon grain boundaries (GBs) make contributions to the conductivity in C<sup>+</sup>-implanted UNCD films by impedance spectroscopy measurements. The impedance value of diamond grains is relatively stable, whist that of grain boundaries (R<sub>b</sub>) dramatically increases after C<sup>+</sup> implantation and decreases as annealing temperature (T<em><sub>a</sub></em>)<sub> </sub>increases from 650 to 1000 <sup>o</sup>C. This means that C<sup>+</sup> implantation has more significant impact on the conductivity of GBs. Conductive atomic force microscopy results evidence that the number of conductive sites increases in GB regions at T<em><sub>a </sub></em>above 900 <sup>o</sup>C, which is originated from the formation of nanographitic phase confirmed by high resolution transmission electronic microscopy. Visible Raman shows that resistive trans-polyacetylene oligomers desorb from GBs at T<em><sub>a </sub></em>above 900 <sup>o</sup>C, which also results in the lower R<sub>b</sub> values of samples C12900 and C121000.
106	<strong>Various Magnetic features and Magnetocaloric effect of spinel type Cobalt ferrite nanoparticles tuned by annealing temperature</strong>	Cobalt ferrite (CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) nanoparticles synthesized by chemical co-precipitation method were studied to see the effect of annealing temperatures on the structural parameters and magnetic properties of the sample. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and SAD pattern demonstrated that single face (fcc) spinel structure of CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> has been formed showing particles in completely crystalline state which was further confirmed by the lattice parameter and the unmixed hkl values. The particle size are in the range of about 5-10 nm depending on the annealing temperature from 200&deg;C to 400&deg;C. The grain growth occurred monotonically with the increase of annealing temperature. The magnetic properties demonstrated a strong dependence on particle size. The saturation magnetization M<sub>s</sub>, remanent ratio M<sub>r</sub>/M<sub>s </sub>and coercivity H<sub>c</sub> increased with the increase of particle size. The hysteresis curves for samples of different grain size showed the ferrimagnetic behavior which are completely analogous to the slow relaxation sextet peaks of M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy. Other parameters such as chemical shift, quadruple splitting and hyperfine field and site occupancy of Fe<sup>3+</sup> were determined by M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy. Ferrimagnetic to superparamagnetic transition temperature known as blocking temperature T<sub>B</sub> was determined from the temperature dependent magnetization curves. With the increase of grain size, Blocking temperature also increases. Maximum entropy changes due to magnetic phase transition was 0.9257 J/kg/<sup>o</sup>C for the samples annealed at 400<sup>o</sup>C in the context of Magnetocaloric effect.
107	Electronic and Magnetic Studies in Heteroepitaxial Self-assembled BaTiO3-Fe2O3 Nanostructures	Self-assembled vertical growth of BaTiO3 nanostructures in the matrix of Fe2O3 is described. Array of well controlled and systematically ordered nanostructures of composite phases were grown on MgO and SrTiO3 single crystal substrate by using pulse laser deposition technique with optimised conditions. The phase purity of composite structures was characterized by using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Surface topographical and morphological measurements are carried out for confirming the nanostructure growth in the composite thin films. Ferroelectric properties are probed by polarization versus electric field (P-E) measurements. The electronic and magnetic properties of the composite is studied by employing X-ray absorption spectroscopy and magnetization study. The presence of strain state in nanostructures play an important role to modify the crystal field effect and magnetic properties of the composite compound. It is shown that the vertical self-assembly of nano rods of BaTiO3 can be grown in the matrix layer of Fe2O3 on MgO substrate by co-ablation.
108	Monolithic integration of BaTiO3 thin film MOSCAPs on Ge wafers	Titanates exhibit electronic properties highly desirable for field effect transistors such as very high permittivity and ferroelectricity. However, the difficulty of chemically etching titanates hinders their commercial use in device manufacturing. Here, we report the selective area in finestra growth of highly crystalline BaTiO3 within photolithographically defined openings of a sacrificial SiO2 layer on a Ge (001) wafer by molecular beam epitaxy. After the BaTiO3 deposition, the sacrificial SiO2 can be etched away, revealing isolated nanoscale gate stacks circumventing the need to etch the titanate thin film. Reflection high-energy electron diffraction in conjunction with scanning electron microscopy is carried out to confirm the crystallinity of the samples. X-ray diffraction is performed to determine the out-of-plane lattice constant and crystal quality of the BTO film. Electrical measurements are performed on electrically isolated Pt/BaTiO3/SrTiO3/Ge capacitor devices.
109	Study of transport property in micro/nano-crystalline silicon films grown using 27.12 MHz assisted PECVD process	Investigation of electrical properties in hydrogenated micro/nano-crystalline (nc-Si:H/&#x03BC;c-Si:H) thin films deposited using 27.12 MHz assisted Plasma Enhanced Chemical vapor Deposition (PECVD) process were presented. In the present study, we use Steady State Photo-carrier Grating (SSPG) technique for the estimation of diffusion length of holes (Lh) in silicon thin films. The Lh found to vary from 0.190 &#x03BC;m to 0.080 &#x03BC;m for 41 % - 22 % crystalline fraction in nc-Si:H/&#x03BC;c-Si:H thin films. In addition to that measurement of temperature dependent dark conductivity and time induced photo-conductivity also conducted for the estimation of activation energy (Ea), coefficient of the variable range hopping process (To) and light induced degradation. From these results, lowest value of Ea (&#xF07E; 0.58 eV), To (&#xF07E; 0.016 &#x00D7; 108 K) with no degradation were observed for the film having 41 % - 32 % crystalline fraction due to the presence of high fraction of crystallites which can create conductive percolation pathway. Moreover, efforts were also also made to understand the light induced volume expansion which has been observed in 38 % &#x03BC;c-Si:H.
110	Sub-nano Crystalline Silicon Thin Films as Active Layer in Solar Cells	The investigation presents the atypical aspects of silicon thin films in terms of growth under variation of applied power using Radio frequency Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition technique (RF-PECVD). The corresponding material found to maintain the typical properties of amorphous without compensating the structural modification in terms of crystallinity and has been defined as a material having the "sub-nano crystalline phase". To explore the characteristics of the existing sub-nano crystalline form of silicon, characterizations like, UV-Visible spectroscopy, Photoluminescence and Temperature dependent conductivity analysis have been effectively made to map the structural details along with the electrical and optical properties. These results conclude the formation of sub-nano crystalline regime which found to be separated via transition regime at 30 W applied power. The article presents sub-nano crystalline silicon thin films as one of the alternative for hydrogenated amorphous silicon in various applications.
111	Coherent transmission of&nbsp; superconducting carriers through a&nbsp; ~ 2 micron&nbsp; polar semiconductor	Coherent transmission of Cooper pairs through a non-superconducting medium is a key challenge for hybrid electronics with superconductors, normal metals and semiconductors. While superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SNS) junctions have been known for quite sometime,<br />including a low carrier density region or&nbsp; a 2 dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the path of superconducting electrons is relatively less explored. Indeed, this is&nbsp; due to the limited choice of materials that would make ohmic contacts to such systems, while simultaneously&nbsp; supporting a superconducting phase. In this paper we show a coherent transmission of supercurrent through a degenerate semiconductor over a length&nbsp;&nbsp; $\approx$ 2~$\mu$m with a critical magnetic field $B_c&nbsp; \approx 8~{\rm T}$ at 1.6~K and $T_c$ $\approx$ 5~K at zero magnetic field. This length scale is much larger than the typical thickness of a Josephson junction.&nbsp; Our system is a fragment of a GaN nanowall network that has been shown to support a&nbsp; high mobility 2DEG ($\mu_n &gt; 10^4 \rm{cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}}$). The current and voltage probes were&nbsp; superconducting Tungsten-Gallium composite electrodes and the measurements could be done in&nbsp; four-probe geometry.&nbsp; We demostrate ballistic type carrier transport with a near ideal transparency of 1 and a critical current ($I_c$) large enough such that the Josephson coupling parameter ${\hbar}{I_c}/e{k_B}T_c &gt;&gt; 1$
112	<strong>An analytical method for calculation of interlaminar normal/shear stresses in micro and nano laminated composite beams</strong>	In this manuscript, a mono dimensional displacement model for micro and nano laminated composite Timoshenko beam is presented. In order to calculate interlaminar stresses correctly, the layer-wise displacement model is refined. In the presented model, the behavior of displacements at the interface of adjacent layers is modeled by transverse and tangential springs of high stiffnesses. The reaction of different springs in different directions indicates an approximation of transverse and tangential interactions between adjacent layers of the laminated beam. Using the presented model and also modified couple stress theory, the in-plane stresses of the laminated composite Timoshenko beam subjected to different boundary conditions including simply - simply supported, clamped - clamped and clamped - free are studied. In addition, the effects of material length scale parameter and elastic foundation on the stresses are investigated. The advantage of this method is accurate calculation of interlaminar stresses without using the equilibrium equations.
113	Reduced thermal conductivity of nanoscale three-dimensional Si phononic crystal with ellipsoidal pores<sup></sup>	In this work, a nanoscale three-dimensional Si phononic crystals (3D Si PnCs) with ellipsoidal pores is proposed and its thermal conductivity is studied through equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) simulations. The results show that 3D Si PnCs with ellipsoidal pores could have much lower thermal conductivity than 3D Si PnCs with spherical pores. When&nbsp;<em>&phi;</em>=60% and&nbsp;<em>&rho;</em>=0.7, the calculated thermal conductivity of 3D Si PnCs with ellipsoidal pores at&nbsp;<em>x</em>&nbsp;direction is merely 0.15 W&middot;m<sup>-1</sup>&middot;K<sup>-1</sup>, which is about 47.65% of the corresponding 3D Si PnCs with spherical pores and is merely 0.10% of bulk Si. For 3D Si PnCs with spherical pores, the low thermal conductivity primarily resulted from increased phonon mode localization. Meanwhile, further reduced thermal conductivity of 3D Si PnCs with ellipsoidal pores mainly caused by phonon backscattering with pore boundaries perpendicular to&nbsp;<em>x</em>&nbsp;direction. Comparing with 3D Si PnCs with spherical pores, the proposed nanoscale 3D Si PnCs with ellipsoidal pores could have extremely low thermal conductivity at&nbsp;<em>x</em>direction even when its porosity is small. This work suggests that 3D Si PnCs with ellipsoidal pores is a promising thermoelectric material for large-scale utilization.
114	Study of Transparent Electrodes Based on Thin Films of Metallic Nanostructures.	Abstract- Transparent electrodes are a necessary component in many modern devices such as touch screens, LEDs and solar cells, all of which are growing in demand. This role has been served by doped metal oxides like indium tin oxide. Now a days, advances in nanostructures have opened the door for other transparent conductive materials, each with unique properties. In this paper metal nanostructures are discussed in which nanowires and grids have relatively large film apertures, and so may need to be combined with another more continuous transparent electrode. The emerging metallic nanomaterials discussed in this paper will continue to allow these same minds to flex their creative capacities to design a revolutionary new breed of transparent and flexible electronics.
115	Mn-doped SnS<sub>2</sub> nanostructure as a potential efficiency CO catalyst:a first-principles study	Abstracts<p>The SnS<sub>2</sub> is a new class of 2D materials with unique properties, which are still largely unexplored in the CO catalyst field. The modulation of electronic structures and chemical activities of the Mn atom substituted for S atom in SnS<sub>2</sub> monolayer sheet is studied based on density functional theory. The electrons of doped Mn are introduced to the dangling bond of monovacancy SnS<sub>2</sub> system, which can enhance the stability of Mn-Sn bond. The Mn-SnS<sub>2</sub> monolayer sheet prefers good catalytic activity for the CO oxidation via the more favorable Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism with a two-step route to the Eley-Rideal or the latest report of termolecular Eley-Rideal mechanisms. In summary, we show first-principles evidence toward the realization of SnS<sub>2 </sub>based catalyst for CO catalytic oxidation which can be facilitating the applications of SnS<sub>2</sub> in the fields of catalysis and air pollution prevention.
116	<strong>An Optimised Way for Extraction of Optical Band Gap Energy from Tauc Plot using Zinc based Nanomaterials </strong>	The application of Zn-based semiconductor nanostructures is developing at an astounding pace due to its size and shape dependent optoelectronic properties. A method to calculate the optical band gap energy (&Delta;E) from Tauc plot using UV-Vis spectra is usually a practice. However, finding the accurate value of &Delta;E by extrapolating the linear segment of the graph may include eye-estimation error. Use of Wang&rsquo;s equation with XRD data to determine &Delta;E may serve as a reference through which accuracy in its estimation may be achieved. This letter compares the values of &Delta;E using Wang&rsquo;s equation with one achieved from the Tauc plot. Discrepancy of the &Delta;E values as-obtained using two above methods may be removed considering the intersection of two tangents in Tauc plot for Zn based nanomaterials<strong>.</strong>
117	Synthesis and characterization of CuInSSe nanoparticals via simple and low cost technique	In this study, we report on the preparation and study of the structural, surface morphology and optical properties of copper indium sulphoselenide (CuInSSe) nanoparticles. CuInSSe nanocrystals are prepared by a wet chemical route using low cost solution precursors for low cost solar cells. The nanoparticals are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/EDAX (Energy Dispersive Analysis of X-ray), TEM (transmission electron microscope) and optical study and the results indicate that the particles crystallize in the chalcopyrite structure, single phase, showing smooth morphology in form of clusters and the optical band gap value is 1.23 eV.  The average crystallite size is calculated from X-ray spectral peaks with Scherrer's formula and it is in the range 30 to 40 nm.
118	Imaging graphene nanoribbons using bimodal dynamic scanning force microscopy	We have performed topographic measurements on graphene nanoribbons after on-surface synthesis using scanning force microscopy. We have excited the cantilever both at its first and second flexural eigenfrequency. While we used the first harmonic for topographic measurements we used the second eigenmode for high-resolution imaging in the frequency channel. The amplitude of the second eigenmode oscillation was only 50~pm to make it sensitive to the measurement of short-ranged forces. The sample was cooled down to liquid nitrogen temperatures while the tip remained at room temperature. We observe the serrated edge of the nanoribbon caused by the armchair configuration of the nanoribbon. In addition we see stripe-like contrast that marks the onset of intramolecular contrast. The edges of the graphene nanoribbons appear much brighter than their center and are sensitive to the atomic-scale configuration of the edge.

The suitable similarity transformations reduced the governing non-linear partial differential equations into the system of coupled ordinary differential equations and are solved by using Finite element method. The sway of various pertinent parameters on velocity, temperature and concentration profiles is examined and the results are shown graphically. Furthermore, the values of local skin-friction coefficient, Nusselt and Sherwood number is also studied for various values of non &ndash; dimensional parameters and the results are shown in tabular form.
120	Computational analysis of heat, mass transfer and entropy generation in Casson nanofluid with thermal radiation and viscous dissipation	This article studies the heat, mass transfer and entropy analysis of Casson nanofluid under the influence of thermal radiation and viscous dissipation over a stretching sheet. This problem is modeled with slip and thermal boundary conditions. Entropy produced, is also discussed. The governing nonlinear PDEs are converted to a set of ODEs using appropriate similarity transformations. Hence resulting system of ODEs are solved by an efficient numerical technique, called the finite difference scheme that is the Keller box method. It is seen that the greater entropy is generated by increasing the values of the thermophrosis parameter, Brownian motion parameter, Biot number and Prandtl number. While it is reduced by increasing the values of Casson fluid parameter, slip parameter and Lewis number. Nusselt number (heat transfer index) and Sherwood number (mass transfer index) have been computed. It is observed that by increasing the values of thermal radiation parameter and Eckert number, the Nusselt number increases. The Sherwood number shows an increasing behaviour for thermal radiation parameter but is a decreasing function of Eckert number.
121	Opto-structural properties of microcrystalline silicon films deposited using 60 MHz assisted VHF-PECVD process	The silicon thin film has been deposited using VHF (60 MHz) plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process. The structural transition along with their variable grain distribution within amorphous silicon matrix has been discussed with the help of optical and structural measurements. Raman characterization along with photoluminescence (PL) and micro-ellipsometry spectroscopy have been investigated to recognize transitions in these silicon films including the microstructure mainly related with crystallite fraction and optical constants. From Raman results, the structural transition from amorphous to microcrystalline growth occurs as indicated by narrow band observed at 515 cm-1 observed at 10 W powers. With increasing power the crystallinity increases and the films are highly crystalline in nature. The contribution of nano-sized crystallites increases the crystalline volume fraction from 32 to 84%. The peak observed nearly at 2 eV in photoluminescence emission spectra (PL) confirms the presence of nanocrystallites in the deposited films. The shift in refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) were also observed at different power variation. The investigation of results obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry explains the microstructure of deposited film with changes in crystallite sizes and their volume fractions.
122	<strong>Quasi-Frenkel-exciton near-UV luminescence with large Stokes shift in trigonal wide-bandgap Cs<sub>4</sub>PbCl<sub>6</sub> nanocrystals</strong>	Inorganic lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have attracted great interest due to their superior luminescent and optoelectronic properties. Compared with ordinary cubic CsPbCl<sub>3</sub> with visible-region luminescence, trigonal Cs<sub>4</sub>PbCl<sub>6</sub> has much wider bandgap and distinct optical properties. Unlike the case of cubic perovskite NCs, little has been known about the luminescence properties of trigonal perovskite NCs. In this study, the well-crystallized Cs<sub>4</sub>PbCl<sub>6</sub> NCs with sizes of 2.2&ndash;11.8 nm are synthesized, which exhibit stable near-UV luminescence with remarkable quantum confinement effect at room temperature. In comparison with negligible Stokes shift in the CsPbCl<sub>3</sub> NCs, the Cs<sub>4</sub>PbCl<sub>6</sub> NCs exhibit very large Stokes shift (0.91 eV). The experiments in combination with first-principles calculations reveal that the near-UV luminescence stems from the quasi-Frenkel excitons trapped in the isolated PbCl<sub>6</sub><sup>4&ndash;</sup> octahedrons of the Cs<sub>4</sub>PbCl<sub>6</sub> NCs; this is different from the CsPbCl<sub>3</sub> NCs whose luminescence originates from the free Wannier excitons. These wide-bandgap Cs<sub>4</sub>PbCl<sub>6</sub> NCs with near-UV luminescence have strong application potential in short-wavelength optoelectronic nanodevices.

The composite thin films are prepared by spincoater with PVDF & Bi25FeO40 nano powder solution mixture. The surface microstructure, confined domain structure & its corresponding d33 coefficient is explored with PFM under poling and no-poling.
124	Enhanced Discharging Energy Density in rGO/PVDF Nanocomposites: the Role of Heterointerface	Recent reports of conductive-filler/polymer composites with large dielectric permittivity K have made them potential candidates for flexible capacitors. Hence, an interesting yet unrevealed question is how these high K composites behave under strong operational electric field strengths. In this letter, we use in-situ-reduced-graphite-oxide (rGO)/Poly(vinylidene fluoride) nanocomposites as an example to study the energy storage behaviour of these high K materials. We show that the dielectric behaviour is contrasting between weak and strong field, and high K materials inevitably become lossier with increasing field strength. Simultaneously, we found the in-situ reduction temperature can affect the energy storage performance, and much enhanced energy storage performances are achieved in nanocomposites reduced at moderate temperatures. For instance, a nanocomposite reduced at 160&deg;C with an rGO volume fraction of 1.5 vol.% possesses a discharging energy density of 0.67J/cm<sup>3</sup> at 50MV/m, corresponding to 2.9 times increase over the pure PVDF. A model is proposed to explain this behaviour involving a reduced electrical contrast of the rGO/PVDF heterointerface that minimizes the recombination of localized charge carriers. The findings of this research have elucidated both the potential and limitation of high K nanocomposites, and has shed light on the optimisation of the design and fabrication of high discharging energy density flexible capacitors for microelectronic devices.
125	Synthesis of CdS nanoparticle by sol-gel method as low temperature NO2 sensor	Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is important to be detected because it is poisonous and dangerous, still at very low concentration. However, most of the NO2 gas sensors based on CdS, not as much of sensitivity at operate high temperatures. Thin film based NO2 gas sensor of Cadmium sulphide (CdS) nanostructures were prepared by the chemical route and deposited over the Pt Inter Digital Electrodes (IDEs) substrates. CdS thin film prepares by spin coating technique with different speed (1000, 2000 and 3000 rpm) and film was annealed at 500 &#xF0B0;C. The CdS thin film was characterized by different techniques, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Ultraviolet-Visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), which offered the information about the chemical structure of CdS, whereas electron microscopy images provided information regarding the morphology of the thin film material. CdS thin film observed maximum response (1.73&#x00D7;102) at 70 {degree sign}C operating temperature towards 20 ppm NO2 gas.
126	Synthesis and characterization of CdTe thin films deposited by electrochemical route	Electrodeposition is a low-cost and environment friendly method for the synthesis of semiconductor thin films and nanostructures. In this work, we synthesized cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin films on indium tin oxide coated glass substrate using an electrodeposition technique from an acidic sulphate aqueous electrolyte at the deposition temperature of 70{degree sign}C. The films were potentiostatically deposited at a constant potential of -0.70V with respect to saturated silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode as reference electrode. These films were characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-Visibe (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) and probestation attached with Keithley source meter to investigate  structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern revealed that the films have cubic structure and are polycrystalline in nature. The average crystallite size and texture coefficient of the film were also calculated. Surface morphology of thin films was analysed using Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The deposited films were homogeneous, uniform. The band gap of CdTe thin films was found to be 1.45 eV from the UV-Vis spectroscopy measurement. From photoluminescence spectrum, emission peak of prepared film was observed at 820 nm. The Electrical studies of films were done with keithley 2400 series source meter and current-voltage behavior was demonstrated. These semiconducting thin films may have broad applications in future optoelectronic based devices.
127	Future of Battery Energy Storage Systems	Growing needs of energy all over the world along with the integration of renewables and introduction of hourly tariff require energy storage in bulk. Li-Ion batteries are most efficient energy storage with energy cost of 400 $/kWh. High cost of Li-Ion batteries is significant barrier to deploy them at large scale. Salt water and redox flow batteries have moderate cost currently used at grid level due to moderate cost have an energy cost of only around 200 $/kWh. A lot of research is needed to reduce the cost to make these batteries viable for grid scale energy storage. This paper highlights key developments achieved in the battery energy storage technology during last 15 years. Along with the cost reduction size and weight reduction are also very important in mobile applications of energy storage like Plugin Hybrid Electrical Vehicles (PHEV). The use of many nano-materials has resulted in increase of energy density of existing battery technologies specially Li-Ion batteries. However, to commercialize the manufacturing of nanomaterial based batteries, a lot of new processes and techniques need to be introduced in the current battery industry.
128	<strong>Radiation stability of CBD grown nanocrystalline CdS films against ion beam irradiation for solar cell applications</strong>	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 200%;">Here we investigate the effect of swift heavy ion irradiation (SHII) on various properties of chemical bath deposited nanocrystalline CdS (nCdS) thin film. For this purpose, nCdS films are exposed to the varying ion fluences (1&times;10<sup>11</sup>-1&times;10<sup>14</sup> ion/cm<sup>2</sup>) of 80 Mev O<sup>+6</sup> ions. Glancing angle x-ray diffraction (GAXRD) and micro-Raman studies confirm the almost negligible structural transformation in CdS after ion irradiation even at highest fluence i.e. 1&times;10<sup>14</sup> ion/cm<sup>2</sup>. GAXRD, micro-Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and UV-Visible spectroscopy studies suggest that the structure, shape and size of particles as well as band gap of the nCdS films remain unaltered upon irradiation. The quality of the films and their radiation hardness is investigated by optical as well as electrical properties using photoluminescence spectroscopy and Hall measurements respectively. The films are found to be radiation resistant for 80 MeV O<sup>+6</sup> ion irradiation as compared to other heavy radiations. The stability of various properties of nCdS films under the impact of SHII may be due to lesser or comparable value of electronic energy loss (S<sub>e</sub>) to the threshold value of S<sub>e</sub>. Radiation hardness of nCdS thin films is a good sign for fabrication of high performance, radiation stable and long lasting solar cell for extraterrestrial applications.</span>
129	Synthesis and characterization of biodegradable cellulose nanowhiskers thin-film structures for flexible electronic devices and packaging application	Environmentally friendly cellulose nanowhiskers are cellulose crystallite rods having 3 - 70 nm dia, 25 nm to >1000 nm in length. Due to some of their properties like high specific surface area to weight ratio, mechanical,low density (1.6g/cm3), surface functionalization potential allowing it to achieve desired properties, and show great promise to biodegradable solutions in market such as packaging, healthcare, textiles, filtration, rheology modifiers, 3D printing & flexible electronics,etc. This work reports the chemical synthesis of cellulose nanowhiskers (CNWh) films from non edible part of cauliflower and were characterized by TGA, DSC, FTIR and electrical conductivity parameters. The 30, 40 and 50 wt% concentration dried cauliflower waste powder (CWP) hydrolysis by H2SO4 and water to split the &#x03B2;-l, 4-glucosidic bonds chain lengths while preserving the basic structure to possesses excellent strength, stability. Uniform flexible thin films of CNWhs were successfully prepared on glass plate at ambient temperature by solvent casting and dried at 50-60{degree sign}C for 120 min in hot air oven. The FTIR showed the glycosidic bonds breakage, peaks disappearance at 1200-1300 cm&#x2212;1 ascribed to lignin removal. CNWh films of 30% and 40% showed the lowest thermal expansion and highest thermal stability. DSC studies revealed that the H2SO4 treated samples are more stable than untreated sample, due to their high glass transition temperature. TGA analysis revealed the better thermal stability upto 190{degree sign}C, initial degradation at 260{degree sign}C and complete degradation at 460{degree sign}C. Conductivity study by four probe method showed the lowest resistivity of 0.755 Ohm.cm in 40% CNWh. The films studied properties showing the excellent device fabrication , packaging,etc applications.
130	Mg doped ZnO nanostructures for efficient Organic Light Emitting Diode	ZnO and Mg-doped ZnO nanostructures have been synthesized by a hydrothermal method for its potential application in Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLED). Studies have been undertaken for structural as well as optical properties of ZnO after Mg doping with various concentrations. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis indicated the rod-like structure for ZnO and with doping it's converted into the tetrapod structure. X-ray diffraction reveals the pure hexagonal phase of the wurtzite structure of ZnO and also finds other peaks related to Mg. UV-Visible suggested the exciton characteristic at room temperature and band gap variation while Photoluminescence spectra reveal two different regions (ultraviolet and blue). Synthesized materials have been blended with Poly [9, 9-dioctylfluorenyl-2, 7-diyl] (PFO) and prototype OLED has been fabricated using these materials as an emissive layer. Electroluminescence spectra show prominent blue emission at 433nm, 460 nm and 490 at 10V. Current-Voltage (I-V) curve reveal that the stability of OLED device at 20% of doping as compared with pristine PFO device.
131	Laser Molecular Beam Epitaxial Growth and Characterization of AlGaN Nanowall Network Structure on Sapphire (0001)	Self-assembled AlGaN nanowall networks have been epitaxially grown on sapphire (0001) by laser molecular beam epitaxy (LMBE) technique. The effect of growth temperature on the formation of AlGaN nanowall network structure has been studied in the range 600-700 &#xF0B0;C. It is found that growth of AlGaN under a strong N-rich growth condition at high growth temperature of 700 &#xF0B0;C is conducive for the formation of self-assembled nanowall network. The AlGaN nanowall network is highly oriented along c-direction as observed by in-situ reflection high energy electron diffraction and high-resolution x-ray diffraction measurements. The nanowall width and pore size are measured to be 20-50 and 30-70 nm, respectively, by using field emission scanning electron microscopy. From room temperature photoluminescence measurement, a strong UV emission at about 3.52 eV due to band-to-band transition is obtained for AlGaN nanowall structure with a high UV-to-yellow luminescence intensity ratio indicating good optical quality. The grown AlGaN nanowall network can find applications in field emitters, photo-detectors, and other nitride based optoelectronic devices.
132	Depth-Profiling X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Analysis of Colloidal ZnO-CdSe Nanocomposites	X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy owing to its short inelastic mean free path of core-level electrons is the most consistent technique for the in-depth analysis of nanoparticles and with the layer-to-layer-depth profiling technique, helpful information regarding state and distribution of constituting elements along the depth of the sample. In this present work, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been used to study the core level of ZnO nanoparticles synthesized by wet chemical route at different calcination time. Composition ratio for Zn:O and various oxidation states are determined to find the best possible ZnO nanocrystals. 1hr calcined ZnO nanoparticles are chosen for synthesizing ZnO-CdSe nanocomposites as these particles were of large size ~ 20 nm, nearly monodispersed and of high purity. These nanocrystals are integrated with CdSe qdots of varied size (5nm and 8nm) via MPA (mercaptopropionic acid) as a linker to develop hybrid nanocomposites for application in Quantum Dot sensitized solar cells QDSSC's. Here, XPS technique has been used as a probe to pictorially model the compositional, structural and morphological aspects of ZnO-CdSe nanocomposites. On the basis of XPS and other complimentary techniques, it was found that high quality of nanocomposite can be synthesized with smaller sized quantum dots, as compared to larger sized quantum dots because of unbounded phosphorus (P) and selenium (Se). Also, it confirms the role of linker that strengthens the binding  of CdSe quantum dots on the surface of ZnO thus making it hard to separate the anchored, interstitial CdSe completely which paves the way for the development of stoichiometric, structurally & morphologically-stable ZnO-CdSe nanocomposites.
133	Influence of solute concentration on the properties of  sol-gel spin coated  Zinc oxide thin films	Zinc Oxide (ZnO) is a versatile material with unique properties, finds variety of application in microelectronics and photonics associated technologies. ZnO thin films have been developed by Sol-gel spin coating method. ZnO thin films have been deposited on to mineral glass substrate under optimized coating conditions, using the sol solution containing different solute concentration viz., 0.27, 0.36, 0.46 and 0.56 mole %. The crystallographic parameters have been evaluated from the XRD data and its variation with solute concentration is investigated. Optical constants and band gap energy of the ZnO thin films have been determined from the transmittance measurement in the UV-Visible region. Higher optical transmittance of 88.3 % have been observed for the ZnO thin film coated with the sol solution containing 3.6 mole % of solute. Atomic force microscopy image of the ZnO films illustrates with uniformly spaced nano structured grains and cylindrical rods. Photoluminescence studies of the ZnO film coated with sol solution containing 0.36 mole % demonstrate three emission peaks at 420 nm, 480 nm and 520 nm respectively for the excitation wavelength 350 nm.  The influences of solute concentration of the ZnO sol solution on the structural, optical and surface properties of the spin coated ZnO thin films have been analyzed and elaborately discussed. This study aimed to develop device quality ZnO thin films for photovoltaic applications.
134	Superconducting properties of NbN film, bridge & meanders	The transport properties of superconducting NbN nanostructures in the form of thin film, bridge of width (w) = 50 &#x00B5;m and three meanders of w = 500, 250 and 100 nm have been investigated by resistance (R) measurements in temperature (T) range = 2 -300 K and magnetic field (B) range = 0 - 7 Tesla. The nano-structuring was carried out using Focused Ion Beam (FIB) milling. Reduction of sample width results in significant changes in the normal and superconducting state properties. For instance, the observed metallic behavior in the thin film sample is lost and the normal state resistance increases drastically from 2.4 &#x03A9; to 418 k&#x03A9; for the 100 nm meander. In the superconducting state the value of critical temperature Tc (upper critical field Bc2 at T = 0 K) reduces gradually with width reduction, it changes from 13.15 K (42.8 Tesla) in the case of thin film sample to 5.7 K (12.7 Tesla) for the 100 nm meander sample. The superconducting transitions are found to get broader for the bridge sample and the meanders additionally show low-temperature resistive tails. In case of all the samples with reduced width, the transition onsets are found to be rounded at surprisingly high values of T ~ 25 K >> Tc. These results are discussed in terms of the possible intrinsic effects due to reduced dimensions and extrinsic effects due to the FIB milling process.
135	Plasma Induced Nanostructures on the Surface of Tungsten Anode in Atmospheric Pressure Glow	Nanostructures such as "fuzz", holes, and flakes were observed on anode electrodes made of stainless steel and tungsten that were exposed to an atmospheric pressure, helium Direct current (DC) glow discharge.  The structures exhibited morphology similar to the tungsten fuzz growth observed in experiments that simulate wall conditions in fusion reactors, suggesting similar physics may be present in both scenarios.  The anode surface temperature ranged between 1000 and 1300 K with an ion fluence rate of order of 1024 s-1m-2.  In this work, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the evolution of nanostructure formation as a function of time.  Observed nanostructures were found to vary with the morphology of the discharge plasma attachment. The composition of the structures was found to be predominantly the native metal. This work gives some insight into the formation of nanostructures at atmospheric pressure which has not only applications for material processing but also provides potentially another avenue to study fuzz formation processes relevant to fusion.
136	Studies of the mechanism and characteristics of the anodic aluminum oxide thin film-enabled fluorescence enhancement	The mechanism of the anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) thin film for the fluorescence enhancement is reported for the first time. It has been found that the main contributing factor to the fluorescence enhancement is the plasmonic Al nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in the film, while the nanopore size and porosity have limited contribution. The characteristics of the enhancement have also been studied. It has been found that the enhancement is highly related to the gap between the fluorophore and the surface of the AAO thin film. Different excitation wavelength also results in somewhat different fluorescence enhancement. Using a simple model with Al NPs uniformly distributed in the thin film, the calculated the enhancement factor and characteristics of the fluorescence enhancement show the similar trend to the experimental results.
137	Effects of electron-electron interaction on the collinear indirect exchange coupling in graphene nanoflake	Using the Hubbard model in the framework of the tight-bonding formulation, We study the effects of the&nbsp;electron-electron (e-e) interaction on the indirect magnetic exchange coupling between the magnetic impurities&nbsp;embedded in triangular graphene nanoflakes.The results show that the magnitude of the coupling enhances&nbsp;in the presence of the e-e interaction and Rashba spin-orbit interaction(RSOI). Also, the RKKY coupling&nbsp;magnitude depends on the impurity positions in nanoflake and the size of the system.
138	<strong>Determining the polarity of AlGaN nanostructure by piezoresponse force microscopy</strong>	The electronic property of the materials can be tuned with the application of mechanical strain to materials having both semiconducting and piezoelectric character leading to a new research area of piezotronics. Group III nitride falls in this category along with its excellent optoelectronic behaviour. The present report demonstrates the piezoresponse force microscopic imaging of the Al<sub>0.97</sub>Ga<sub>0.03</sub>N nanostructures oriented in different crystallographic directions. Al<sub>0.97</sub>Ga<sub>0.03</sub>N nanostructures are grown by the plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy technique. The phase formation is investigated by the Raman spectroscopic analysis. Spatial distribution of piezoresponse for Al<sub>0.97</sub>Ga<sub>0.03</sub>N nanostructures was mapped and the polarities of the different crystalline planes of <em>m</em> and <em>c</em> are determined. The corresponding piezoresponse is explained on the basis of spontaneous and induced polarization in a unit cell of the hexagonal crystal, which is further confirmed using piezoresponse spectroscopy. An unusually high value of d<sub>33 </sub>~ 9.0 pm/V for nanosize Al<sub>0.97</sub>Ga<sub>0.03</sub>N is attributed to the availability of free boundary for volume expansion or contraction at the nanoscale.
139	Oxidation facilitated antimicrobial ability of laser micro-textured titanium alloy against gram-positive staphylococcus aureus for biomedical applications	Micro-textures were engineered on titanium samples by rapid, highly repeatable and cost effective nanosecond laser texturing process. The controlled and repeatable micro-texture was effective in reduction of adhesion and proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus. However, the adhesion and proliferation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells was found unaffected. We observed time-delayed saturation of oxidation on laser micro-textured Ti6Al4V as compared to pristine material yielding super-hydrophobic surface (contact angle of ~158.2&#x02DA;). An in-house setup was designed to expose a 3 dimensionally laser micro-textured Ti6Al4V sample to S. aureus-spiked-nutrient-broth for 24 hours in a closed loop continuous flow system. We observed 50 % reduction of S. aureus adhesion and proliferation over laser micro-textured surface than pristine samples. In-vitro tests confirmed that blood coagulation remain largely unaffected, while protein adsorption was decreased by four folds on the micro-textured surfaces; a desirable property for surgical tools. Nanosecond laser micro-textured surfaces were effective in reducing S. aureus adhesion and its proliferation due to phase evolution, oxidative transformation of Ti6Al4V as well as due to reduction of surface potential. In addition, laser based micro-texturing is a non-toxic, environment friendly green process that also provides cost effective alternative over conventional surface modification techniques such as mechanical micromachining and chemical treatments.
140	Effect of MWCNT-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Water Hybrid Nanofluid on the Thermal Performance of Ribbed Channel with Apart Sections of Heating and Cooling	Two-dimensional (2D) numerical simulation is performed to &nbsp;simulate the laminar force convection of nanofluid in a ribbed channel with apart heating (cooling) sources using lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The multi-wall carbon nanotubes-iron oxide nanoparticles/water hybrid nanofluid (MWCNT-Fe3O4/water hybrid nanofluid) used in this simulation. &nbsp;The velocity field, temperature distribution and heat transfer rate are analyzed numerically with the streamlines and isotherm patterns by a house-code. Also, the effect of Reynolds number (Re=25, 50, 75 and 100), nanoparticle solid volume fraction (&#x03D5;=0, 0.001, 0.003) and ratio of the height of blocks (A=0.2, 0.3, 0.4) considered in this paper. The computational method is validated with the results reported in the literature and a good agreement is founded. The obtained results showed a maximum value 16.49% increase in average heat transfer coefficient for all the considered cases compared to the base fluid. Moreover, the local Nusselt number showed that the use of blocks on the channel's walls could increase the amount of heat transfer. Finally, averaged Nusselt number shows a linear dependence by increasing the ratio of the height of blocks for constant solid volume fraction. The results of this study are &nbsp;applicable in industrial equipment heating and cooling applications.
141	<strong>Non-volatile memory and negative photoconductivity in a metal-insulator-semiconductor diode with embedded Co nanoparticles</strong>	We describe a new metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) device in which Cobalt based nano particles (NPs) in a core-shell structure (Co &ndash; core and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> - shell) are embedded between a thermally grown SiO<sub>2</sub> layer and a HfO<sub>2</sub> film deposited by atomic layer deposition. Two additional structures were prepared for comparison. One had no NPs and the other included the Fe NPs, prepared using the same procedure as used for the Co film. All devices exhibited the classic behavior of a voltage variable MIS capacitor with or without a large hysteresis as in non-volatile memory systems. However, only the device with Co core-shell structure exhibits a negative photoconductivity (NPC) effect as well as non-volatile memory (NVM) capabilities in both the capacitance-voltage (<em>C-V)</em> and current-voltage (<em>I-V) </em>characteristics. The dependence of <em>C-V</em> and current voltage <em>I-V</em> characteristics on illumination intensity and wavelength (from ultraviolet to near infrared) as well as on temperature were characterized. Illumination enhances the NPC effect as well as the flat-band voltage shift determined from C-V characteristics and hence the memory width. Illumination in the wavelength range of 735-780 nm caused a current decrease, at a given voltage, by up to a factor of two. The NPC effect stimulates an annihilation of the stored charges and therefore erases the system instantly at small applied bias. The main cause of NPC effect under illumination is the photo excitation of supplementary trap channels in the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> shell, which lowers the free carrier density and hence the conductivity of the MIS structure.
142	<strong> Width and strain effect on quantum transport in MoS2 armchair nanoribbons </strong>	Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC), which in its monolayer form has the direct bandgap of 1.8 eV. This large bandgap makes MoS2 a good candidate for using in transistors. The density-functional study of strain and width effects on the electronic band structure and transport properties of the MoS2-bare and MoS2-passivated armchair nanorib- bons are presented. We focused on the quantum conductance and band structures of the MoS2-bare and MoS2-passivated armchair nanoribbons applying Wannier function and Non-Equilibrium Green Function in different width, and for width 7 and 8 under strain in -15% to +15%. Our results indicate that MoS2-passivated armchair nanoribbons are good candidates for using in transistors, composites and for fabrication of flexible electronic devices.
143	Probing Patchy Saturation of Fluids in Nanoporous Media by Ultrasound	Nanoporous materials provide high surface area per unit mass and are capable of fluids adsorption. While the measurements of overall amount of fluid adsorbed by a nanopororus sample are straightforward, probing the fluid spacial distribution is non-trivial. We consider published data on adsorption and desorption of fluids in nanoporous glasses reported along with the measurements of ultrasonic waves propagation. We analyse these using Biot's theory of dynamic poroelasticity, approximating the patches as spherical shells. Our calculations show that on adsorption the patch diameter is on the order of 10-20 pore diameters, while on desorption the patch size is comparable to the sample size. Our analysis suggests that one can employ ultrasound to probe the uniformity of fluid spatial distribution in nanoporous materials.
144	<strong>Ignition and self-propagating reactions in Al/Pt multilayers of varied stoichiometry</strong>	The propensity of Al/Pt multilayers to undergo high temperature, self-propagating reactions has been evaluated across broad ranges of stoichiometry and bilayer thickness. Freestanding, ~1.6 mm-thick Al/Pt multilayers having nanometer-scale layer thicknesses ignite and exhibit rapid exothermic reactions when the molar ratio of reactants is in the range of 1Al:4Pt to 4Al:1Pt. &nbsp;Reactive Al/Pt structures have heats of reaction (<em>&#x2206;H<sub>rxn</sub></em>) between -30 and -95 kJ/mol.at. with equimolar forms showing the largest calorific output. Ignition occurs at temperatures below the melting point of both reactants (and eutectics) demonstrating that initiation occurs via solid-state mixing.&nbsp; Equimolar multilayers exhibit the lowest ignition temperatures when comparing structures having a specific bilayer thickness.&nbsp; Equimolar Al/Pt multilayers also undergo the most rapid self-sustained reactions with wavefront speeds as large as 73 m/s. &nbsp;Al- and Pt-rich multilayers react at reduced rates (as low as 1 m/s), consistent with reduced |<em>&#x2206;H<sub>rxn</sub></em>| and lower adiabatic temperatures. &nbsp;Nearly all of the reactive multilayers undergo stable, propagating reactions characterized by a smooth wavefront morphology.&nbsp; Only multilayers made with a 1Al:4Pt molar ratio and large bilayer thickness of 800 nm exhibit a 2-D instability.&nbsp; An analytical model that accounts for key thermodynamic properties, preliminary mixing along interfaces, and thermal/mass transport is used to predict the wavefront speed dependencies on bilayer thickness.&nbsp; Good fits to experimental data provide estimates for thermal diffusivity of premixed interfacial volumes and activation energy associated with mass transport.&nbsp; We suggest that Pt dissolution in to molten Al is a rate-limiting step underlying propagating reactions in many forms of Al/Pt.
145	Nanometer Growth of Marine Bio-films of Different Metallic Alloys in Seawater by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy	The main purpose of this study was to monitor the growth of the marine bio-film, of micro/macro-organisms, on the surface of different metallic alloys in seawater by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The alloys used in this study were; UNS 1020 carbon steel, stainless steel 304, stainless steel 316L, Sanicro 28, Cu-Ni 70-30, Hastelloy G-30, and titanium. The EIS was used to measure the A.C. Impedance (Z) and the double layer capacitance (Cdl) of the formed bio-film in seawater on a frequent basis. The total exposure time of the tests was ranged between 90 days to 180 days. The visual inspection of the tested samples showed a bio-film formation on the surface of these samples.  The microbiologically influenced (induced) corrosion(MIC) was observed only on the carbon steel.   Monitoring the growth of the bio-film formation was accomplished by the EIS during the 90-180 days exposure of the tested samples.   A gradual monitoring of the growth of the bio-film formation was achieved by mathematically correlating the obtained the A.C. Impedance (Z) and the double layer capacitance (Cdl) of the bio-film to the thickness of the bio-film formation.   The advantage of EIS is a non-invasive technique with a sensing (spatial) resolution in a nanometer scale in a comparison to other techniques of monitoring the growth of bio-films on metallic alloys in aqueous solutions.
146	Transmitted optical spatial differentiator based on subwavelength high-contrast gratings	A transmitted optical spatial differentiator based on subwavelength high-contrast gratings (HCG) is proposed experimentally. The spatial differentiation property of the subwavelength HCG is analyzed by calculating its spatial spectral transfer function based on the periodic waveguide theory. By employing the FDTD solutions, the performance of the subwavelength HCG spatial differentiator was investigated numerically. The subwavelength HCG differentiator with thickness at nanoscale was fabricated on the quartz substrate by the electron beam lithography and the Bosch deep silicon etching. Observed under an optical microscope with a CCD camera, the spatial differentiation of the incident field profile was obtained by the subwavelength HCG differentiator in transmission without Fourier lens. By projecting the images of slits with different widths and letter `X' on the subwavelength HCG differentiator, edge detections of both kinds of images were obtained in transmission. With the nanoscale HCG structure and simple optical implementation, the proposed optical spatial differentiator provide the prospects for application in optical computing systems and parallel data processing.

Here, it is interesting&nbsp;that the electron crystals&nbsp;can be built on plasma surface induced by intensive faster photons&nbsp;on silicon, which is similar with&nbsp;Wigner crystal&nbsp;in intensive electric field or intensive magnetic field. In the two-dimensional&nbsp;(2D)&nbsp;Bravais lattices, the electron crystals of three-fold, four-fold and six-fold symmetry lattices can be observed on plasma surface by using the reflecting&nbsp;Talbot effect images. On these surface period lattices, the decay spectrum&nbsp;of faster emission on the&nbsp;2D transient&nbsp;electron crystal was measured, which is related to&nbsp;the faster decay peak with lifetime of 100ns. These new phenomena have a good application in preparing the PN junction&nbsp;of photo-electronic devices, where the surface electron gas on plasma surface can inject into the top layer to build N type region, and the positive ions under plasma can inject into the bottom layer for forming P type region on silicon&nbsp;in vacuum.
148	A new application area of C<sub>60</sub>: overall improvement of insulating oil&rsquo;s electrical performance	A new nano-C<sub>60</sub> based insulating oil was found which is considered could overcome the barriers to the application of nano-modified insulating oil. We found nano-C<sub>60</sub> based insulating oil has an excellent stability and its electrical performance increased by 17.9%, 9.3% and 8.3%, respectively, for AC and positive/negative lightning impulse voltage. We believe C<sub>60</sub> molecules have a strong capacity to absorb electrons and they can capture photons in the streamer, which may weaken the photo ionization in streamer and thereby improve the electrical performance of insulating oil.
149	<strong>Tunable Magnetic Properties and Valley Splitting in Layered Ferrovalley 2H-VSe<sub>2</sub>: Strain and Layer Thickness Effects</strong>	Geometry structure, band structure, magnetic moment and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy of layered 2H-VSe<sub>2</sub> are investigated by first-principles calculations. It is found that the VSe<sub>2 </sub>are intrinsic ferromagnetic with an in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy no matter how the change of the strain and layer thickness is. Additionally, the valley splitting in monolayer VSe<sub>2</sub> can be modulated by strain due to the modulated intrinsic exchange interaction of V 3<em>d </em>electrons. Interestingly, the valley splitting decreases and the V magnetic moment monotonously increases as a strain increases, showing that the valley splitting is related to the magnetic moment. Furthermore, the slight effect of interlayer coupling on V magnetic moment appears. The tunable magnetism and valley splitting may provide novel applications in multifunctional nanoelectronics.
150	<strong>Large negative thermal expansion in highly strained multiferroic films</strong>	In contrast to bulk BiFeO<sub>3</sub> (BFO), highly strained BFO films (nearly tetragonal phase, T-like phase) possess many more characteristics favorable for device applications, such as colossal ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties, nanoscale shape memory effect, persistent photoconductivity and an electromechanical response. Here, we identify novel negative thermal expansion (NTE) behavior in highly strained BFO films. Through La doping, the N&eacute;el temperature can be further adjusted over a broad range of temperatures. The lattice parameters show anomalies at the spin order-to-disorder transition point that are driven by spin-lattice coupling. For the Bi<sub>0.9</sub>La<sub>0.1</sub>FeO<sub>3</sub> film, NTE is observed from room temperature to 673 K or even higher, with a giant negative coefficient of linear thermal expansion of <strong>&alpha;</strong> = -12.8&times;10<sup>-6</sup> /K occurring over 370 K. Furthermore, we find that the NTE effect is greatly enhanced by phase coexistence in T-like BFO films. A giant negative coefficient of linear thermal expansion of <strong>&alpha;</strong> = -22.3&times;10<sup>-6</sup> /K is observed at T = 400-673 K for a 50 nm mixed-phase T-like BFO film. Our findings have broad application prospects for functional materials to display not only good physical properties but also controllable thermal expansion.
151	<strong>The origin of photoluminescence in &beta;-Ga&shy;<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></strong>	&beta;-Ga&shy;<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, a candidate material for power electronics and UV optoelectronics, shows strong room temperature photoluminescence (PL). In addition to the three well known bands of as-grown samples in the UV, blue and green, also red PL was observed upon nitrogen-doping. This raises the possibility of applying &beta;-Ga&shy;<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanostructures as white phosphors. Using an optimized, Koopmans-compliant hybrid functional, we show that most intrinsic point defects, as well as substitutional nitrogen act as deep acceptors, and each of the observed PL bands can be explained by electron recombination with a hole trapped in one of them. We suggest this mechanism to be general in wide band gap semiconductors which can only be doped <em>n</em>-type. Calculations on the nitrogen acceptor reproduce the observed red luminescence accurately. Earlier we have shown that not only the energy, but the polarization properties of the UV band can be explained by self-trapped hole states. Here we find that the blue band has its origin mainly in singly negative Ga&ndash;O divacancies, and the green band is caused dominantly by interstitial O atoms (with minor contribution of Ga vacancies to both). These assignments can explain the experimentally observed dependence of the PL bands on free electron concentration and stoichiometry. The information provided here paves the way for the conscious tuning of light emission from &beta;-Ga&shy;<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.
152	Simultaneous growth of diamond and SiC/graphene nanolaminate: Formation of a triple hybrid material	A diamond, 3C-SiC and graphene composite material is synthesized via microwave chemical vapor deposition on a cemented tungsten carbide substrate. The deposited composite material consists of a microcrystalline diamond phase and a second phase, a SiC/graphene nanolaminate structure. The formation of this triple hybrid structure was confirmed by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The growth mechanism is discussed.
153	Nanoscale patterning of electronic devices at the amorphous&nbsp;LaAlO<sub>3</sub>-SrTiO<sub>3</sub> oxide interface using an electron sensitive polymer mask	A new approach is presented for designing complex oxide mesoscopic electronic devices based on the conducting interfaces of room temperature grown LaAlO<sub>3</sub>/SrTiO<sub>3</sub> heterostructures. The technique is based entirely on methods known from conventional semiconductor processing technology and we demonstrate lateral resolution of ~100 nm. We study the low temperature transport properties of nanoscale wires and demonstrate the feasibility of the technique for defining in-plane gates allowing local control of the electrostatic environment in mesoscopic devices.
154	<strong>Momentum-quantization induced band splitting in semiconductor nanostructures: Observation of emission lines in InP nanotubes</strong>	The effect of spatial confinement-induced momentum quantization on the band structure of semiconductor nanotubes is investigated by developing a theoretical model with subsequent experimental verification on MOCVD-grown InP nanotubes. The incorporation of momentum quantization in sp<sup>3</sup>s*-model with spin-orbit coupling indicates the splitting of &Gamma;-point into two different symmetric points, &Gamma;' and &Gamma;", which emit two spectral lines as confirmed by cathodoluminescence spectra. The observation provides novel insight into the band structure based transport behavior of semiconductor quantum devices.
155	<strong>Femtosecond Two-photon Absorption Spectroscopy of Copper Indium Disulfide Quantum Dots: A Structure-Optical Properties Relationship</strong>	We have interpreted the two-photon absorption spectrum of water-soluble Cu<sub>0.18</sub>In<sub>0.42</sub>S<sub>2</sub> QDs with an average diameter of approximately 2.6 nm. For that, we employed the wavelength-tunable femtosecond Z-scan technique and the parabolic effective-mass approximation model, in which the excitonic transition energies were phenomenologically corrected due to the stoichiometry of the nanocrystal. This model considers a conduction band and three valence sub-bands allowing excitonic transitions via centrosymmetric (<em>&Delta;l = &plusmn;1</em>, where <em>l </em>is the angular momentum of the absorbing state) and noncentrosymmetric (<em>&Delta;l = 0</em>) channels. In such case, this became relevant because the CuInS<sub>2</sub> QDs with chalcopyrite crystal structure is a noncentrosymmetric semiconductor. Thus, our experimental results pointed out two 2PA allowed bands located at 715 nm (2hv =3.47 eV) and 625 nm (2hv =3.97 eV) with cross sections of (6.3 &plusmn; 1.0) x 10<sup>2</sup> GM and (4.5 &plusmn; 0.7) x 10<sup>2</sup> GM, respectively. According to the theoretical model, these 2PA bands can be ascribed to the 1P<sub>1/2</sub>(h<sub>3</sub>) &rarr; 1S<sub>3/2</sub>(e) (lower energy band) and 1P<sub>1/2</sub>(h<sub>heavy</sub>) &rarr; 1S<sub>3/2</sub>(e) <strong>(90%)</strong>/<strong>(10 %)</strong>1P<sub>1/2</sub>(h<sub>split-off</sub>) &rarr; 1P<sub>3/2</sub>(e) (higher energy band) excitonic transitions. A good agreement (magnitude and spectral position) between the experimental and theoretical data were obtained. However, our experimental data suggest that the higher-energy 2PA band may have other contributions due to the mixing between the heavy- and the light-hole bands, which the effective mass model does not take into consideration.
156	Bilayered graphene nanoribbons with closed edge holes: atomic structures and electronic properties	Here we presented results which may be considered as a first step to initiate the fundamental interest to the perforated bilayered nanoribbon structures with close edges based on graphene. Theoretical investigations of a novel bilayered graphene nanoribbon (BGNR) structures with periodically arranged hole using <em>ab initio</em> calculations is presented. BGNRs with various type of stacking (AA, AB and 30&deg;) were considered. If was found that such structures could display different electronic properties (from semiconducting to metallic) depending on the geometry configuration of the holes.
157	Computational analysis of Joule-heating and viscous dissipation effects on magnetohydrodynamic flow and heat transfer of Cu-water Jeffrey nanofluid over a stretching sheet	The purpose of the present study is to examine  the impact of copper nanoparticles on the steady 2D magnetohydrodynamic boundary layer  flow and heat transfer  of Jeffrey fluid over a stretching sheet with viscous dissipation. Copper nanoparticles  are suspended with water, kerosene and ethylene glycol  as the base fluids. The governing non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) are reduced to the non-linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by using  appropriate dimensionless variables and then solved numerically by using Keller-box technique. The impacts ofsnanoparticle volume fraction,  magnetic parameter, Deborah number,  Prandtl number and Eckert number  on the velocity and temperature profiles, local Nusselt number and skin friction %drag coefficient%s are investigated with the assistance of graphs and tables. Results indicate that the  velocity, skin friction and local Nusselt number for the  copper-water nanofluid are comparatively less than those of the base fluid, however the temperature is enhanced through the addition of nanoparticles.  It is found that both the skin friction and the Nusselt number increase by increasing the  Deborah number whereas they decrease by increasing the magnetic parameter. It is noticed that the copper-water Jeffrey nanofluids has higher skin friction and heat transfer rate as compared to copper-ethylene glycol and copper-kerosene Jeffrey nanofluids.
158	<strong>Perpendicular Anisotropy in the Heusler Compound Co<sub>2</sub>TiSi</strong>	Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, a property of utmost importance in magnetic nano&shy;techno&shy;&shy;logies, is relatively easy to create in ultrathin films due to surface and interface contributions. In films of Co<sub>2</sub>TiSi on MgO, which are of interest for high-density magnetoresistive random-access memories (MRAMs), perpen&shy;dicular anisotropy has been achieved for film thicknesses of a few atomic layers, but thermal stability in nanoelectronic devices requires perpendicular anisotropy in thicker films. Here we report robust perpendicular anisotropy of 0.5 MJ/m<sup>3</sup> in 100 nm epitaxial films of Co<sub>2</sub>TiSi on MgO(001). This result is surprising for several reasons. First, surface and inter&shy;face aniso&shy;tropies are too small to explain perpendicular anisotropy in such films. Second, Co<sub>2</sub>TiSi has a substantial magnetization and crystallizes in a cubic Heusler struc&shy;ture, so that conventional wisdom predicts a preferential magnetization direction in the film plane rather than perpendicular. Third, the films have lattice constants a = b &raquo; c and the cor&shy;responding strain is unable to account for the perpendicular anisotropy. We explain the per&shy;pendicular anisotropy as a symmetry-breaking chemical-ordering effect promoted by the substrate.
159	Tuning nanostructures and optical properties of undoped and N-doped ZnO by supercritical fluid treatment	It has been reported that supercritical fluid can improve the performance of ZnO based devices, while the mechanism of this improvement is still unclear. In this paper we study the transformation of surface morphologies and emission properties of ZnO films before and after supercritical fluid treatment, connecting the two structures together, which can tune the performance of ZnO films or ZnO films based device, such as catalytic, opto-electronic performance. Both undoped and N-doped ZnO nanostructures obtained by supercritical fluid (SCF) treated films are investigated by the surface morphology techniques (scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force morphology (AFM)), as well as room temperature photoluminescence (RT-PL). It is found that, the W-SCCO2 technology can be used to effectively obtain the nanostructures in ZnO films with self-catalyzed process due to the Zn rich condition in ZnO films, and can promote the inhibition of defect luminescence by inducing -OH into the films. Two models are proposed to interpret the supercritical processes. This work demonstrates that the water-mixed supercritical CO2 (W-SCCO2) technology could be used as a novel effective tool for nano design and for improving the properties of functional metal oxides.
160	Pattern formation on ion-irradiated Si surface at energies where sputtering is negligible	The effect of low energy irradiation, where the sputtering is&nbsp; imperceptible, has not been deeply studied in the pattern formation. In this work, we want to address this question by analyzing the nanoscale topography formation on Si surface, which is irradiated at room temperature by Ar<sup>+</sup> ions near the displacement threshold energy, for incidence angles ranging from 0 to 85<sup>o</sup>. The transition from smooth to ripple patterned surface, i.e. the stability/instability bifurcation angle is observed at 55<sup>o</sup>, whereas the ripples with their wave-vector is parallel to the ion beam projection in the angular window of 60-70<sup>o</sup>, and with 90<sup>o</sup>&nbsp;rotation with respect to the ion beam projection at the grazing angles of incidence. A similar irradiation setup has been simulated by means of molecular dynamics, which made it possible, firstly, to quantify the effect of the irradiation in terms of erosion and redistribution using sequential irradiation and, secondly, to evaluate the ripple wavelength using the crater function formalism. The ripple formation results can be solely attributed to the mass redistribution based mechanism, as erosion due to ion sputtering near or above the threshold energy is practically negligible.
161	Efficient correction of wavefront inhomogeneities in X-ray holographic nanotomography by random sample displacement	In X-ray tomography, ring-shaped artifacts present in the reconstructed slices are an inherent problem degrading the global image quality and hindering the extraction of quantitative information. To overcome this issue, we propose a strategy for suppression of ring artifacts originating from the coherent mixing of the incident wave and the object. We discuss the limits of validity of the empty beam correction in the framework of a simple formalism. We then deduce a correction method based on two-dimensional random sample displacement, with minimal cost in terms of spatial resolution, acquisition and processing time. The method is demonstrated on bone tissue and on a hydrogen electrode of a ceramic-metallic solid oxide cell. Compared to the standard empty beam correction we obtain high quality nanotomography images revealing detailed object features. The resulting absence of artifacts allows straightforward segmentation and posterior quantification of the data.
162	Orthogonally polarized self-mixing grating interferometer for two-dimensional displacement measurement	In this paper, we present an orthogonally polarized self-mixing grating interferometer (SMGI) for simultaneous measurement of in-plane and out-of-plane displacements. The measurement ranges in both directions are limited only by the length of grating. The orthogonally polarized lights emitted from a birefringent He-Ne laser are separated and enter the grating at {plus minus}1st-order Littrow diffraction angles, respectively. The diffraction beams return to the laser cavity then self-mixing interference effect occurs. To differentiate the orthogonally polarized lights and obtain high resolution, phase modulation technique is introduced to extract phases from the orthogonally polarized SMGI signals. Based on mode competition effects, balanced detection is applied to avoid the laser internal noise in the signal. Measurement results show that the proposed system can reach a nanoscale resolution and submicron accuracy in both two directions. The work provides a good way to achieve high precision two-dimensional displacement measurement with a robust system configuration.
163	Study of buckling behavior at the nanoscale through capillary adhesion force	This paper presents mechanical actuation experiments performed on ultrathin suspended nanoscale silicon devices presenting Euler buckling. The devices are fabricated by a combination of focused ion beam (FIB) implantation and selective wet etching. By loading the center of curved nanobeams with an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip the beams can be switched from an up-buckled position to the opposite down-buckled configuration. It is possible to describe the entire snap-through process thanks to the presence of strong capillary forces that act as physical constraint between the tip and the device. The experiments conducted recall the same behavior of macro and microscale devices with similar geometry. Curved nanobeams present a bistable behavior, i.e. they are stable in both configurations, up or down-buckled. In addition to that, by the method presented, it is possible to observe the dynamic of a mechanical switch at the nanoscale.
164	Spectroscopy of gold atoms and gold oligomers in helium nanodroplets	The 6p <sup>2</sup>P<sub>1/2</sub> &#x2190; 6s <sup>2</sup>S<sub>1/2</sub> and 6p <sup>2</sup>P<sub>3/2</sub> &#x2190; 6s <sup>2</sup>S<sub>1/2</sub> transitions (D lines) of gold atoms embedded in superfluid helium nanodroplets have been investigated using resonant two-photon ionization spectroscopy. Both transitions are strongly blue-shifted and broadened due to the repulsive interaction between the Au valence electron and the surrounding helium. The in-droplet D lines are superimposed by the spectral signature of Au atoms relaxed into the metastable <sup>2</sup>D states. These features are narrower than the in-droplet D lines and exhibit sharp rising edges that coincide with bare atom transitions. It is concluded that they originate from metastable <sup>2</sup>D state AuHe<sub>n</sub> exciplexes that have been ejected from the helium droplets during a relaxation process. Interestingly, the mechanism that leads to the formation of these complexes is suppressed for very large helium droplets consisting of about 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> He atoms, corresponding to a droplet diameter on the order of 50 nm. The assignment of the observed spectral features is supported by <i>ab-initio</i> calculations employing a multiconfigurational self consistent field (MCSCF) method and a multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) calculation.sFor large helium droplets doped with Au oligomers, excitation spectra for mass channels corresponding to Au<sub>n</sub> with n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 are presented. The mass spectrum reveals even-odd oscillations in the number of Au atoms that constitute the oligomer, which is characteristic for coinage metal clusters. Resonances are observed close by the in-droplet D1 and D2 transitions, which, surprisingly, exhibit a very similar shape independent of the cluster size.
165	FREE ENERGY OF WATER HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEATION IN THE FIELD OF NANOSCOPIC DEFECTS ON BASAL FACE OF  &#x03B2;-AgI CRYSTAL	The free energy, the formation work and the entropy dependences for water condensate formed from the vapor over the defect-free and containing surface defects basal face of &#x03B2;-AgI crystal at initial stage of adsorption at temperatures of 260 K and 400 K are calculated using the bicanonical statistical ensemble method, with Ewald summation for long-range electrostatic and polarization interactions with the substrate. The effect of surface defects in form of rectangular "towers" as a part of regular structure on the adsorption capacity of the surface is investigated. In contrast to the small-scale structures, relatively larger coarse-grained nanostructure on crystal surface demonstrates unconditional advantages in adsorption properties with respect to defect-free surface. The adsorption on the surface with multiple defects begins at vapor pressures 5-6 orders of magnitude lower than on the defect-free surface. The increased adsorption capacity of nanostructured surface is resistant to temperature variations. The adsorbate on the surface of the crystal is thermodynamically stable, both on defect-free and nanostructured surfaces, with the exception of short initial stage of the monomolecular film on the defect-free surface.
166	<strong>Effects of Laser Wavelength on Aluminum Plasma in Transverse Magnetic Fields</strong>	The influence of laser wavelength on nanosecond laser-produced Al plasma in transverse magnetic field is studied. A Q-switch Nd:YAG pulsed laser is used to ablate an aluminum sample at 50 mJ at 1064 nm, 532 nm, and 266 nm wavelengths. A permanent magnetic trap is used with nearly uniform magnetic field of 0.8 T to confine plasma expansion, reduce both fast and slow components of plasma velocity, and increase signal intensity. Fast photography is performed using an Intensified Charged Coupled Device (ICCD) camera to study the plume hydrodynamics as it evolves through the magnetic field. Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) is used to determine the effect of laser wavelength on key ionic and neutral emission lines, including enhancement and reduction of certain emission lines in the presence of a magnetic field. Fast photography results confirm that laser wavelength has a significant effect on plume hydrodynamics, especially as it evolves through the magnetic field which confines both fast and slow components of the plasma as early as ~45 ns after laser impact for all laser wavelengths used, as well as reducing the velocity of the plasma by about 4 to 5 times. It is shown that 266 nm laser wavelength under magnetic field enhanced both ionic and neutral lines by up to 11 times while 532 nm laser plasma only showed enhancements in ionic lines with reduction in neutral. Laser wavelength of 1064 nm showed a slight enhancement of ionic lines with a significant reduction in neutral lines under the same conditions.
167	Buffer Insensitive Optoelectronic Quality of InP-on-Si with Templated Liquid Phase Growth	As Moore's Law comes to an end, the search for additional integrated circuit functionality has shifted from scaling lateral dimensions down to combining multiple materials onto a single substrate. However, the quality of crystalline semiconductors is highly sensitive to the substrate upon which it is grown, preventing multiple materials from being directly grown on single substrates. To circumvent this challenge, many complex growth strategies have been developed, such as strain relaxation buffer-layers, nanostructure growth, and template selective epitaxy.  However, even with these advanced growth technique, the growth of manufacturable crystalline materials is still limited to crystalline surfaces. Here, we show that using templated liquid phase (TLP) growth, single crystalline indium phosphide on Si can be using a variety of buffers, both crystalline and amorphous. However, by performing detailed optoelectronic characterization, we find that the quality of the grown material not only closely matches commercial single crystalline InP wafers but is also highly insensitive to the buffer layer used. This unique feature of TLP growth could enable the next generation of crystalline material integration.
168	Glasses of three alkyl phosphates show a range of kinetic stabilities when prepared by physical vapor deposition	In situ AC-nanocalorimetry was used to characterize vapor-deposited glasses of three phosphates with increasing lengths of alkyl side chains: trimethyl phosphate, triethyl phosphate, and tributyl phosphate. The as-deposited glasses were assessed in terms of their reversing heat capacity, onset temperature, and isothermal transformation time. Glasses with a range of kinetic stabilities were prepared, including kinetically stable glasses, as indicated by high onset temperatures and long transformation times. Trimethyl phosphate forms highly stable glasses, similar to many other organic molecules, while triethyl phosphate and tributyl phosphate do not. Triethyl phosphate and tributyl phosphate present the first examples of non-hydrogen bonding systems that are unable to form stable glasses via vapor deposition at 0.2 nm/s. Based on experiments utilizing different deposition rates, we conclude that triethyl phosphate and tributyl phosphate lack the surface mobility required for stable glass formation. This may be related to their high enthalpies of vaporization and the internal structure of the liquid state.
169	Heating rate dependent ignition of Al/Pt nanolaminates through pulsed laser irradiation	Direct laser irradiation of sputter deposited Al/Pt nanolaminate multilayers results in rapid local heating and exothermic mixing of reactant layers. Milli- and microsecond pulsed laser irradiation under certain test conditions leads to single-point ignition of rapid, self-propagating, formation reactions. Multilayers having bilayer thicknesses of 328 nm, 164 nm, and 65 nm are characterized by their ignition onset times and temperatures. &nbsp;Smaller bilayer thickness multilayers require less laser intensity for ignition compared with larger bilayer designs (when utilizing a particular pulse duration). The relationship between laser intensity and ignition onset time is used to calibrate an activation energy for ignition within a finite element reactive heat transport model. The local heating rate is varied from 10<sup>4</sup> K/s to 10<sup>6</sup> K/s by selecting a laser intensity. &nbsp;Kissinger analysis was performed on the heating rate-dependent ignition temperatures measured with high speed pyrometry to experimentally determine an activation energy in the foils of (6.2 &plusmn; 1.6 x 10<sup>4</sup> J/mole atoms). This value is then compared to an activation energy produced from model fits to ignition onset time of 7.2 x 10<sup>4</sup> J/mole atoms.
170	Improved electrical conductivity of poly(ethylene oxide) nanofibers using multi-walled carbon nanotubes	Highly conductive nanofibers with 1570 S/m were obtained from electrospinning of a polymer solution containing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Homogeneous dispersion of high concentrations of MWCNTs was achieved by attaching poly(styrenesulfonic acid <em>graft</em> aniline) (PSS-<em>g</em>-ANI), an amphiphilic surfactant, to the MWCNT surface. The hydrophilic sulfonic acid group facilitated the dissolution of PSS-<em>g</em>-ANI-grafted MWCNTs in a polyethyelene oxide solution up to 6.7 wt% MWCNT. To our knowledge, this is the highest level of MWCNT doping attained in a solution designed for electrospinning. With the incorporation of PSS-<em>g</em>-ANI, the concentration of MWCNTs embedded in the electrospun nanofibers increased. More importantly, the alignment of MWCNTs along the nanofiber axis increased significantly, as confirmed by observed birefringence under crossed polarizers. The combination of higher doping levels and better alignment afforded highly conductive nanofibers suitable for electronic nanodevices.
171	Gelatin coated magnetic nanowires as highly detectable optical labels	This work proposes the elaboration of magnetic nickel nanowires (NiNWs) coated with gelatin as highly optical detection labels. Incorporation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) into the gelatin matrix helps amplify detection limits. Our approach takes advantage of the use of NiNWs that act as preferential light dispersant and the use of an inexpensive gelatin coating; this coating helps impregnate AgNPs by simultaneously increasing the composite plasmonic contrast and as an antimicrobial protector. Synthesized nanocomposiste exhibits superior detection performance in the pico g/mL range when compared with light scattering techniques; the best detection limit of our optical label is <em>ca.</em> 140 pg/mL (0.14 ppb). Obtained detectability compares with sophisticated expensive state-of-art detection levels suggesting that our nanocomposite may be used in many fields of study including medicine, microbiology and chemistry of materials.
172	<strong>Effects of Surface Tension and Viscosity on Gold and Silver Sputtered onto Liquid Substrates </strong>	In this paper we study DC magnetron sputtering of gold and silver onto liquid substrates of varying viscosities and surface tensions. We were able to separate the effects of viscosity from surface tension by depositing the metals onto silicone oils with a range of viscosities. The effects of surface tension were studied by depositing the metals onto squalene, poly(ethylene glycol), and glycerol. It was found that dispersed nanoparticles formed on liquids with low surface tension and low viscosity whereas dense films formed on liquids with low surface tension and high viscosity. Nanoparticles formed on both the liquid surface and within the bulk liquid for high surface tension liquids. &nbsp;Our results can be used to tailor the metal and liquid interaction to fabricate particles and films for various applications in optics, electronics, and catalysis.
173	<strong>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Acoustic Absorption by a Carbon Nanotube</strong>	Acoustic absorption by a carbon nanotube (CNT) was studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in a molecular domain containing a monatomic gas driven by a time-varying periodic force to simulate acoustic wave propagation. Attenuation of the sound wave and the characteristics of the sound field due to interactions with the CNT were studied by evaluating the behavior of various acoustic parameters and comparing the behavior with that of the domain without the CNT present. A standing-wave model was developed for the CNT-containing system to predict sound attenuation by the CNT and the results were verified against estimates of attenuation using the thermodynamic concept of exergy. This study demonstrates acoustic absorption effects of a CNT in a thermostatted MD simulation, quantifies the acoustic losses induced by the CNT and illustrates their effects on the CNT. Overall, a platform was developed for MD simulations that can model acoustic damping induced by nanostructured materials such as CNTs, which can be used to further understanding of nanoscale acoustic loss mechanisms associated with molecular interactions between acoustic waves and nanomaterials.
174	Negative Differential Resistance, Rectification, Tunable Peak-Current Position and Switching Effects in an Alanine-based Molecular Device	The transport properties of a molecular bio-electronic device based on the Alanine amino-acid is investigated. The considered device consisting of an Alanine molecule as the central potential-dot coupled to two ZGNR (zigzag graphene nanoribbon) conducting electrodes. The current-voltage characteristics of this dual tunneling molecular junction are studied at two different optimized compositions of the central molecule. The proposed amino-acid based structure utilize the tunneling coupling similar to that of semiconducting single electron transistors (SETs) to avoid complications due to the atomic interfaces. The current-voltage characteristics show polarity-dependent behavior making the device feasible of being applied as a molecular rectifier. Negative differential resistance (NDR) along with tunable peak-current position has been also observed in the current-voltage characteristics. The device is also capable of being applied as a switch controllable by the central molecule orientation.
175	<strong>Quasi-free-standing silicene in 2D van der Waals heterostructures</strong>	<strong>Silicene is a promising 2D Dirac material because of its novel electronic properties and potential integration with current silicon-based nano-/micro-electronics technology. However, unlike most other 2D materials, which are relatively inert, silicene has an active surface and interacts strongly with solid substrates. On the other hand, silicene has been found to interact weakly in graphene/silicene/graphene (Gr/Si/Gr) heterostructures. Here we use first-principles calculations to search among several such heterostructures with different 2D materials as cladding layers to find the best choice that preserves the properties of free-standing silicene, especially the Dirac points, which are not preserved at the Fermi energy in Gr/Si/Gr heterostructures. We find that quasi-free-standing silicene can be achieved in BN/silicene/BN heterostructure, with the Dirac cones left intact at the Fermi energy. We further discuss potential van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) of two silicene layers that are separated by multiple BN layers and cladded by monolayer BN. Interlayer coupling between the two silicene layers is present when there is either one or two BN layers separating the silicene layers, but the coupling becomes negligible at three BN layers. We further investigated potential BN/silicene superlattices. By changing the number of BN layers between silicene layers, a conversion between Dirac lines and Dirac points can be achieved in such superlattices.</strong>
176	<strong>Skyrmionium &ndash; high velocity without the skyrmion Hall effect</strong>	The lateral motion of a magnetic skyrmion, arising because of the skyrmion Hall effect, imposes a number of restrictions on the use of this spin state in the racetrack memory. A skyrmionium is a more promising spin texture for memory applications, since it has zero total topological charge and propagates strictly along a nanotrack. Here, the stability of the skyrmionium, as well as the dependence of its size on the magnetic parameters, such as the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, are studied by means of micromagnetic simulations. We propose an advanced method for the skyrmionium&rsquo;s nucleation due to a local enhancement in the spin Hall effect. The stability of the skyrmionium being in motion under the action of the spin polarized current is analyzed.

178	<strong>Localized Deformation in Ni-Mn-Ga Single Crystals</strong>	The magnetomechanical behavior of ferromagnetic shape memory alloys such as Ni-Mn-Ga, and hence the relationship between structure and nanoscale magnetomechanical properties, is of interest for their potential applications in actuators. Furthermore, due to its crystal structure, the behavior of Ni-Mn-Ga is anisotropic. Accordingly, nanoindentation and magnetic force microscopy were used to probe the nanoscale mechanical and magnetic properties of electropolished single crystalline 10M martensitic Ni-Mn-Ga as a function of the crystallographic <em>c</em>-axis (easy magnetization) direction relative to the indentation surface (i.e., <em>c</em>-axis in-plane versus out-of-plane). Load-displacement curves from 5-10 mN indentations on in-plane regions exhibited pop-in during loading, whereas this phenomenon was absent in out-of-plane regions. Additionally, the reduced elastic modulus measured for the <em>c</em>-axis out-of-plane orientation was ~50% greater than for in-plane. Although heating above the transition temperature to the austenitic phase followed by cooling to the room temperature martensitic phase led to partial recovery of the indentation deformation, the magnitude and direction of recovery depended on the original relative orientation of the crystallographic <em>c</em>-axis: positive recovery for the in-plane orientation versus negative recovery (i.e., increased indent depth) for out-of-plane. Moreover, the <em>c</em>-axis orientation for out-of-plane regions switched to in-plane upon thermal cycling, whereas the number of twins in the in-plane regions increased. We hypothesize that dislocation plasticity contributes to the permanent deformation, while pseudoelastic twinning causes pop-in during loading and large recovery during unloading in the <em>c</em>-axis in-plane case. Minimization of indent strain energy accounts for the observed changes in twin orientation and number following thermal cycling.
179	<strong>Probability of Conductive Bond Formation in a Percolating Network of Nanowires with Fusible Tips</strong>	Meeting the heat dissipation demands of microelectronic devices requires development of polymeric composites with high thermal conductivity. This property is drastically improved by percolation networks of metallic filler particles that have their particle-to-particle contact resistances reduced through thermal or electromagnetic fusing. However, composites with fused metallic fillers are electrically conductive, which prevents their application within the chip-board and the inter-chip gaps. Here we propose that electrically insulating composites for these purposes can be achieved by the application of fusible metallic coatings to the tips of nanowires with thermally conductive, but electrically insulating cores. We derive analytical models that relate the ratio of the coated and total nanowire lengths to the fraction of fused, and thus conductive, bonds within percolating networks of these structures. We consider two types of materials for these fusible coatings. First, we consider silver-like coatings, which only form conductive bonds when contacting the silver-like coating of another nanowire. Second, we consider liquid metal-like coatings, which form conductive bonds regardless of whether they contact a coated or uncoated segment of another nanowire. These models were validated using Monte Carlo simulations, which also revealed that electrical short-circuiting is highly unlikely until most of wire is coated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that switching the tip coating from silver- to liquid metal-like materials can double the fraction of conductive bonds. Consequently, this work provides motivation to develop scalable methods for fabrication of the hybrid liquid-coated nanowires, whose dispersion in polymer matrix is predicted to yield highly thermally conductive, but electrically insulating composites.
180	Chemical potential and free energy of nanoconfined water in Newton black films	In this work we investigate possible approximations to the free energy and chemical potential of water within a Newton black film as a natural nanoconfinement. As a first step we explore the different approximations in a sample of 500 water molecules (bulk water), finding that the overlapping distribution method is the more accurate. For the Newton black film we also calculate the free energy profile of the water molecules along the bilayer normal. We obtain that depending on the position of the water molecule inside the bilayer, the excess chemical potential is lower than that of bulk water, suggesting that a water molecule is more stable inside the Newton black film than in bulk. A charged semiflexible amphiphilic model and the TIP5P model of water are used in our simulations.
181	Physical Vapor Deposition of Ag Nanoparticles through Shadowing Assembly	The morphology evolution of Ag NPs deposited by glancing angle deposition (GLAD) in a wide range of nominal deposition thickness d at room temperature has been investigated systematically. Non-spherical Ag NPs are formed with d < 500 nm, while vertical Ag nanorod-like nanostructures are produced when d > 500 nm. Based on three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations, such a morphological change can be attributed to the high mobility and reemission of Ag atoms as well as the shadowing effect during the GLAD growth.
182	<strong>Single-shot femtosecond laser ablation of gold surface in air and isopropyl alcohol environments: nanotopographic and optical emission studies </strong>	Dynamics of ablative plumes from a gold surface in ambient air and liquid iso-propyl alcohol were studied by time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy in single-shot IR femtosecond-laser ablation regimes, typical for non-filamentary and non-fragmentation laser production of nanoparticles sols. Despite one order of magnitude shorter (few nanoseconds) lifetimes and almost two orders of magnitude lower intensities of the ablative plume emission in the alcohol ambient at the same peak laser fluence, nanofoam-like spallative crater topographies appeared rather similar for the dry and wet conditions. These facts envision the underlying surface spallation as one of basic ablation mechanisms relevant for both dry and wet advanced femtosecond laser surface nano/micro-machining and texturing, as well as for femtosecond laser ablative production of nanoparticle sols by MHz femtosecond-laser pulse trains via their direct nanojetting in air and fluid environments.
183	Accurate Energies of Highest-Occupied Molecular Orbitals and Lowest-Unoccupied Molecular Orbitals of Metal Clusters Using Efficient Density Functional Computations	The paper presents a computational method for the estimation of highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of metallic nano-clusters using efficient density functional computations with the high accuracy of the GW method. Electronic structures of magnesium nano-clusters Mgn(n=1-22,25,30,35,40) are computed using the density functional theory (DFT) and the quasiparticle GW method. It is found that the energy difference between the DFT and GW results, defined as the scissors operator or correction, is only dependent on the cluster size, and independent of the electronic shell filling effect. The scissors operators of HOMOs and LUMOs of metallic clusters can thus be fitted by using simple power functions of the cluster size n. Therefore, the HOMOs and LUMOs of metallic clusters can be efficiently calculated using DFT with a modification of scissors operators. The scissors operators are also demonstrated to be applicable to occupied and unoccupied states near the Fermi level.
184	<strong>The Germanium &ldquo;Halo&rdquo;: Visualizing invisible Ge interstitials</strong>	We report the ability to image distributions of Ge interstitials within amorphous SiO<sub>2</sub> matrices using conventional transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive <em>x</em>-ray fluorescence mapping. While previous, established methods have only been able to infer the presence of interstitials within materials, our direct &ldquo;visualization&rdquo; approach allows the ability to study and better understand the dynamics of several interesting phenomena that occur within the Ge-Si-O system during processing at temperatures greater than 700<sup>o</sup>C. These phenomena include Ostwald Ripening, migration of Ge nanocrystallites through amorphous SiO<sub>2</sub> and Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> matrices, Ge incorporation in Si-rich materials such as Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and Si, and finally, morphological changes in the Ge nanocrystallites themselves.
185	Dynamics of a magnetic skyrmionium driven by spin waves	The magnetic skyrmionium is a skyrmion-like structure but carries a zero net skyrmion number, which can be used as a building block for non-volatile information processing devices. Here, we study the dynamics of a magnetic skyrmionium driven by propagating spin waves in both thin films and nanotracks. It is found that the skyrmionium can be effectively driven into motion by spin waves showing tiny skyrmion Hall effect, of which the mobility is much better than that of the skyrmion at the same condition. We also show that the skyrmionium mobility depends on the nanotrack width and damping coefficient, and can be controlled by an external out-of-plane magnetic field. Besides, we demonstrate the skyrmionium motion driven by spin waves is inertial. Our results indicate that the skyrmionium is a promising building block for building spin-wave spintronic devices.
186	<strong>Diode Junction Temperature in Ultraviolet AlGaN Quantum-Disks-in-Nanowires</strong>	The diode junction temperature (T<sub>j</sub>) of light emitting devices is a key parameter affecting the efficiency, output power and reliability. Herein, we present experimental measurements of the T<sub>j</sub> on ultraviolet (UV) AlGaN nanowires (NWs) light emitting diodes (LEDs), grown on a thin metal-film and silicon substrate using the diode forward voltage and electroluminescence (EL) peak-shift methods. The forward-voltage vs temperature curves show temperature coefficient <em>dV<sub>F</sub>/dT</em> values of -6.3 mV/&deg;C and -5.2 mV/&deg;C, respectively. Significantly smaller T<sub>j</sub> of 61.45 &deg;C is measured for the sample on metal substrate, as compared to that of the sample on silicon (105.76 &deg;C), at 50 mA, which results from the better electrical-to-optical energy conversion and the absence of the thermally insulating SiN<sub>x </sub>at the NWs/silicon interface. Lower T<sub>j</sub> of 24 &deg;C was achieved using the peak-shift method for the sample on metal substrate. In contrast to the reported higher T<sub>j</sub> values for AlGaN planar LEDs exhibiting low lateral and vertical heat dissipation, we obtained a relatively lower T<sub>j</sub> at similar values of injection current. Lower temperatures are also achieved using IR camera, confirming that the T<sub>j</sub> reaches higher values than the overall device temperature. Furthermore, the heat source density is simulated and compared to experimental data. This work provides insight in addressing the high junction temperature limitations in light-emitters and it aims to realize UV AlGaN NWs for high power and reliable devices.

188	Magnetic field influenced augmented thermal transport in superparamagnetic cobalt and nickel ferrite aqueous nanocolloids	Nanoscale ferrites have become increasingly popular in novel nanoscale engineering and&nbsp;technology involving magnetism. The present article reports a novel aqueous magnetic&nbsp;nanofluid of high colloidal phase stability and high thermal conductivity enhancement in the&nbsp;presence of external magnetic fields. Nanoscale, superparamagnetic and high magnetic&nbsp;moment cobalt (CoFe2O4) and nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) particles have been used to synthesize&nbsp;stable water based MNFs. Largely amplified thermal conductivity of the colloids under the&nbsp;influence of magnetic field has been observed. Augmentation in thermal conductivity ~175%<br />(in comparison to zero field case) has been observed for CoFe2O4 MNF at 0.4 T for 7 vol. %<br />concentration whereas for the NiFe2O4 it has been observed to be ~ 110 %. Near field<br />magneto-static interactions and Neel-Brownian relaxivity of the magnetic nanoparticles has<br />been discussed to play important roles in the particle fibrillation and augmented heat<br />conduction process. Decrease of thermal conduction caliber beyond certain field strength has<br />been observed and this phenomenon has been elucidated by appealing to the thermodynamics<br />considerations of chain clustering. A mathematical model has been put forward to deduce the<br />enhancement in thermal conductivity of the magnetic fluids under influence of field and good<br />agreement has been obtained with respect to experimental observations. The present nanoferrite based smart magnetic colloids with enhanced and field tunable thermal transport<br />characteristics hold strong potential as futuristic micro-device thermal management smart<br />systems.

191	Femtosecond Laser Metal-smithing of Sub-wavelength Structures	We thoroughly study the modification of indium semi-spherical nanostructures with radii of around 175 nm<br />into linear microstructures more than 2 &mu;&#x0016;m long in the direction of laser polarization. The experimental results<br />and a rudimentary analysis confirm that melting occurs from intense laser pulses.

192	Cavitation bubble nucleation induced by shock-bubble interaction in a gelatin gel	An optical visualization technique is developed to study cavitation bubble nucleation that results from interaction between a laser-induced shock and a preexisting gas bubble in a 10 wt% gelatin gel; images of the nucleated cavitation bubbles are captured and the cavitation inception pressure is determined based on Euler flow simulation. A spherical gas cavity is generated by focusing an infrared laser pulse into a gas-supersaturated gel and the size of the laser-generated bubble in mechanical equilibrium is tuned via mass transfer of the dissolved gas into the bubble. A spherical shock is then generated, through rapid expansion of plasma induced by the laser focusing, in the vicinity of the gas bubble. The shock-bubble interaction is recorded by a CCD camera with flash illumination of a nanosecond green laser pulse. The observation captures cavitation inception in the gel under tension that results from acoustic impedance mismatching at the bubble interface interacting with the shock. We measure the probability of cavitation inception from a series of the repeated experiments, with varying the bubble radius and the standoff distance. The threshold pressure is defined at the cavitation inception probability equal to one half and is calculated, through comparisons to Euler flow simulation, at &minus;24.4 MPa. This threshold value is similar to that from shock-bubble interaction experiments using water, meaning that the gel viscoelasticity has a minor impact on bubble nucleation dynamics.
193	Influence of ambient gas on the optical properties of CdS quantum dots prepared by plasma-liquid interactions	In this study CdS quantum dots were fabricated by injecting non-equilibrium plasma jet into the aqueous solution including Na2S2O3, CdSO4 and Thioglycolic acid (TGA) in the presence of an ambient gas such as nitrogen and oxygen gases. In order to investigate the structure, morphology, size and chemical nature of the prepared CdS nanocrystals in presence of ambient gas, X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), tunneling electron microscopy (TEM) and dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used. The optical properties of CdS nanoparticles were characterized using UV-Vis and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies. It was found that the presence of ambient gases especially oxygen, reduces the size and concentration of the synthesized nanoparticles, while the crystalline structure of these nanoparticles is not altered. It was also found that with the increase of flow rate of ambient gas the PL emission intensity of quantum dots was reduced, and the PL position as well as absorption edge shifts to blue wavelengths.
194	<strong>Excitonic recombinations in thin porous GaN epilayers deposited on Si(111)</strong>	<em>We investigate the similarity between the behavior of the photoluminescence of porous gallium nitride and the one of an assembly of quantum wires as it was previously discovered for the case of porous silicon (</em><em>M.

The photoluminescence properties of porous GaN can be interpreted within the concept of an in-homogeneously size-distributed collection of nanorods. The recombination rate is considered as a competing mixture of radiative and nonradiative recombination rates with contribution of </em><em>slow non-radiative surface recombination. The photoluminescence intensity increases from 2D films configuration to a porous one, in line with inhibition of in-plane carrier diffusion towards non-radiative recombination centers produced by the porosification of the material. </em>

196	Direction-Dependent Stretchability of AgNW Electrodes on Microprism-Mediated Elastomeric Substrates	Silver nanowires (AgNWs) have become an efficient electrode candidate for stretchable electronics. We report the effects of directional stretching in microprism-mediated AgNW stretchable electrodes on polyurethane (PU) substrates. The wavy substrate is fabricated using a customized microprism on polyethylene terephthalate. AgNWs on stretchable PU substrates show stable normalized resistance up to 35% strain under parallel uniaxial stretching. This performance is much better than AgNWs on bare PU substrate or on wavy PU under perpendicular stretching, which can only sustain 10%-15% strain before significant increase in normalized resistance. Finite element simulations were conducted to reveal the strain distribution and variation in the AgNW electrodes on both bare and wavy PU substrates when stretched along parallel and perpendicular directions. Comparing to AgNW electrodes on bare PU and on wavy PU under perpendicular stretching, the wavy PU surface relief features can effectively alleviate the strain in the AgNW network when stretched along parallel direction, leading to better performance.
197	Tolman lengths and rigidity constants of multicomponent fluids: Fundamental theory and numerical examples	The curvature dependence of the surface tension can be described by the Tolman length (first order correction)sand the rigidity constants (second order corrections) through the Helfrich expansion. We present and explainsthe general theory for this dependence for multicomponent fluids and calculate the Tolman length and rigiditysconstants for a hexane-heptane mixture by use of density gradient theory. We show that the Tolman lengthsof multicomponent fluids is independent of the choice of dividing surface and present simple formulae thatscapture the change in the rigidity constants for different choices of dividing surface. For multicomponentsfluids, the Tolman length, rigidity constants and the accuracy of the Helfrich expansion depend on the choicesof path in composition and pressure space along which droplets and bubbles are considered. For the hexane-sheptane mixture, we find that the most accurate choice of path is the direction of constant liquid-phasescomposition. For this path, the Tolman length and rigidity constants are nearly linear in the mole-fractionsof the liquid-phase and the Helfrich expansion represents the surface tension of hexane-heptane droplets andsbubbles within 0.1% down to radii of 3 nanometers. The presented framework is applicable to a wide range ofsfluid mixtures and can be used to accurately represent the surface tension of nanoscopic bubbles and droplets.
198	Dielectric sphere-coupled THz super-resolution imaging	A straightforward THz imaging method, analogous to microsphere optical nanoscope, is proposed and developed with spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit. By attaching a 3 mm Teflon sphere directly onto a free-standing silicon grating, a subwavelength spatial resolution better than l/3 is demonstrated. Furthermore, the dielectric sphere-coupled THz microscope not only enables far-field, large-area measurement but also characterizes high-throughput and broad-bandwidth imaging properties. In addition, a numerical study of the THz pulse propagation through a dielectric sphere agrees well with the experimental results, showing frequency-dependent magnification and focal length.
199	Low-Frequency Noise in Supported and Suspended MoS<sub>2</sub> Transistors	Sensitivity of sensors, the phase noise of oscillators and intrinsic device performance at the nanoscale are primarily limited by fluctuations in resistance at low frequencies, also called flicker noise. These intrinsic fluctuations in resistance become more prominent in two-dimensional materials due to their ultra-thin nature. Here, we report the low-frequency noise (LFN) behavior of supported and suspended MoS<sub>2</sub> field effect transistors. Carrier-number fluctuation mechanism was found to be responsible for LFN in both configurations. The extracted frequency index (&gamma; in 1/f<sup>&gamma;</sup>) indicates the different trap time-constants and mechanisms responsible for LFN in MoS<sub>2</sub> transistors. A&nbsp;&gamma; value of 2 in suspended transistors indicates a tight trap time-constant distribution likely due to recombination-generation through trap states arising only from intrinsic defects and/or extrinsic adsorbates. A wide time-constant distribution (&gamma; ~1 to 1.4) in supported transistors indicates the presence of various kinds of traps such as adsorbates, intrinsic defects as well as interface and oxide traps. Further, variation in S<sub>0</sub> (characterizes the magnitude of noise) with gate voltage in both supported and suspended device configurations was validated analytically using the carrier-number fluctuation model.
200	Control and Manipulation of Geometric Nonlinearity in Ultrathin Nanoelectromechanical Systems	Nonlinearities in nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) play a vital role in dynamics of the device. Clear understanding of nonlinearities and ability to control and manipulate them to enhance the performance are crucial for applications with these devices. Here we utilize an electrostatic mechanism to control the geometric nonlinearity of an atomically thin NEMS. The exquisite control enables us to demonstrate hardening, softening and mixed nonlinear responses in the device. The electrostatic control over the nonlinearity is utilized to effectively nullify Duffing nonlinearity in a specific regime. The observed mixed nonlinear response is the result of cross coupling between strong quadratic and quartic nonlinearities, an aspect explained by method of multiple scale analysis.
201	Microcavity enhanced single photon emission from two-dimensional WSe2	Atomically flat semiconducting materials such as monolayer WSe2 hold great promise for novel optoelectronic devices. Recently, quantum light emission has been observed from bound excitons in exfoliated WSe2. As part of developing optoelectronic devices, the control of the radiative properties of such emitters is an important step. Here we report the coupling of a bound exciton in WSe2 to open microcavities. We use a range of radii of curvature in the plano-concave cavity geometry with mode volumes in the &lambda;^3 regime, giving Purcell factors of up to 8 while increasing the photon flux five-fold. Additionally we determine the quantum efficiency of the single photon emitter to be &eta; = 0.46 &plusmn; 0.03. Our findings pave the way to versatile monolayer based, ultra-bright single photon sources for a wide range of applications in nanophotonics and quantum information technologies.
202	Deterministic control of radiative processes by shaping the mode field	Quantum dots (QDs) interacting with confined light fields in photonic crystal cavities represent a scalable light source for the generation of single photons and laser radiation in the solid-state platform. The complete control of light-matter interaction in these sources is needed to fully exploit their potential, but it has been challenging due to the small length scales involved. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the control of the radiative interaction between InAs QDs and one mode of three coupled nanocavities. By non-locally moulding the mode field experienced by the QDs inside one of the cavities, we are able to deterministically tune, and even suppress, the spontaneous emission into the mode. The presented method will enable the real-time switching of Rabi oscillations, the shaping of the temporal waveform of single photons and the implementation of novel nanolaser modulation schemes.
203	A Three-Dimensional Model for Lubricant Depletion Dynamics under Sliding Condition on Bit Patterned Media of Disk Drives	In this paper we model the depletion dynamics of molecularly thin layer of lubricants on bit patterned media disk of disk drives under a sliding air bearing head. The dominant physics and consequently the lubricant depletion dynamics on a patterned disk are shown to be significantly different from the well studied cases on a smooth disk. Our results indicate that the surface tension effect, which is negligible on a flat disk, apparently suppresses depletion by enforcing a bottleneck effect around the disk pattern peak regions to thwart the migration of lubricants. When the disjoining pressure is relatively small, it enhances the depletion. But when the disjoining pressure becomes dominant, the disjoining pressure resists depletion. Disk pattern orientation plays a critical role in the depletion process. The effect of disk pattern orientation on depletion originates from its complex interaction with other intermingled factors of external air shearing stress distribution and lubricant particle trajectory. Patterning disk surface with nanostructures of high density, high aspect ratio, and particular orientation is demonstrated to be one efficient way to alleviate the formation of lubricant depletion tracks.
204	<strong>The nanoscale partial-gate InAs nanowire field-effect transistors for suppressing the excess OFF-state current</strong>	<span style="margin: 0px; line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="margin: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">The excess OFF-state current caused by band to band tunneling (BTBT) is a serious issue for short channel nanowire (NW) field-effect transistors (FETs), especially for semiconductors with narrow bandgap such as InAs. Here, to suppress the OFF-state current, we for the first time fabricate and study InAs NW FETs with nanoscale partial-gate (PG). While compared with full-gate (FG) FET fabricated on the same NW, PGFET shows better OFF-state characteristics. Through studying the devices with different measurement conditions and fabrication processes, we find the excess OFF-state leakage current is mainly induced by the BTBT caused by the high-field at the drain-end of the channel, which can be obviously suppressed by the ungated region of PGFET. The roles of both electrons and holes current are discussed and bipolar gain effect is found to also exist in InAs NW FETs. Through statistic study, we find BTBT effect can be more serious in the devices with better gate-control.</span></span>
205	A novel branched CdO/ZnO core/shell heterogeneous structure and its enhanced photoelectrocatalytic performance	We report a novel branched core/shell CdO/ZnO hetero-nanostructure with hexagonal symmetry. The nanomaterials were fabricated via an improved one-step chemical vapor deposition method, consist of a CdO wire as the core and ZnO as the shell. With cadmium act as catalyst, ZnO nanowires grow as perpendicular branches from the CdO/ZnO one-dimensional core/shell structure. The nanostructures were characterized with XRD and TEM. A homogeneous epitaxial growth mechanism has been postulated for the formation of the nanostructure. The materials show a broad and strong absorption ranging from visible to ultraviolet and a better photoelectrocatalytic properties in comparison to pure ZnO or CdO.
206	A Time-Resolved Millimeter Wave Conductivity Apparatus (TRmmWC) for Charge Dynamical Properties of Semiconductors	We demonstrate a contactless, time-resolved, millimeter wave conductivity apparatus capable of measuring photoconductivity of a diverse range of materials. This cavity-less system determines the time-dependent magnitude of a sample's charge carrier density-mobility product by monitoring the response of a continuous, millimeter-wave probe beam following excitation of the sample by an ultrafast laser pulse.  The probe beam is tunable from 110 GHz to 170 GHz and the sample response data can be obtained over the sub-nanosecond to millisecond time interval.  This system fills the frequency gap between microwave and terahertz techniques, and has been tested on silicon wafers, perovskite thin films and CdSxSe1-x nanowire samples. We demonstrate a minimum detectable photoconductance change of ~1 &#xF06D;S and an estimated time resolution for conductance decay of ~ 100 picoseconds.  The calibration constant of the system, needed for quantitative calculation of photoconductivity from experimental data, has been determined using silicon wafers.  This system has several advantages over currently used techniques, such as facile tunability of probe frequency and substantially wider time range for study of decay kinetics, while maintaining an open sample environment that enables characterization of a wide range of sample sizes under controlled environmental conditions.
207	Wide field of view, real time bioimaging apparatus for noninvasive analysis of nanocarrier pharmacokinetics in living model animals	Understanding nanocarrier pharmacokinetics is crucial for the emerging nanopharmacy, which highly demands noninvasive and real-time visualization of the in vivo dynamics of nanocarriers. To this end, we have developed a 2-photon excitation and time-resolved (TPE-TR) bioimaging apparatus for the analysis of the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of nanocarriers in living model animals. The specific polymeric nanocarrier, Eu@pmma-maa doped with Eu-complexes luminescing in long persistence at ~615 nm upon near-infrared 2-photon excitation, allows the complete rejection of tissue autofluorescence by selective luminescence detection. This together with an unique beam shaping scheme for homogeneous line excitation, a delicate timing strategy for single-shot and line-by-line imaging, as well as an equal optical path design for in-plane scanning, endow the TPE-TR apparatus with the following prominent features: An imaging depth of ~10 mm, a field of view (FOV) of 32&#x00D7;32 mm2 along with a horizontal resolution of ~60 &#x03BC;m, a sub-10 second frame time and negligible laser heating effect. In addition, a combination of the in-pane line scan with the 3D scan of a model animal offers the convenience for examining an interested FOV with a millimeter vertical resolution. Application of TPE-TR bioimaging to living mouse reveals rich information on the dynamics of nanocarriers including the spatial distribution, the temporal evolution, and the kinetics of domains of interest. The noninvasive TPE-TR bioimaging instrumentation with a wide FOV and a large imaging depth will find applications in the pharmaceutical development of nanocarriers and relevant research fields.<sup>
208	Less severe processing improves carbon nanotube photovoltaic performance	Thin film semiconducting single walled carbon nanotube (s-SWCNT) photovoltaics suffer losses due to trapping and quenching of excitons by defects induced when dispersing s-SWCNTs into solution. We study these aspects by preparing photovoltaic devices from (6,5) carbon nanotubes isolated by different processes: extended ultrasonication, brief ultrasonication, and shear force mixing. Peak quantum efficiency increases from 28 to 38 to 49% as the processing harshness decreases and is attributed to both increasing s-SWCNT length and reducing sidewall defects. Fill-factor and open-circuit voltage also improve with shear force mixing, highlighting the importance of obtaining long, defect-free s-SWCNTs for efficient photoconversion devices.
209	<strong>Electronic phase engineering induced thermoelectric enhancement in manganites</strong>	The nano-structuring engineering and the introduce of magnetic scattering are effective ways to enhance the thermoelectric performance. In this work, we use the magnetic treatments on the La<sub>0.4</sub>Pr<sub>0.225</sub>Ca<sub>0.375</sub>MnO<sub>3 </sub>system to demonstrate that the electronic phase engineering can enhance the thermoelectric performance by simultaneously reducing the thermal conductivity and raising the power factor in the strongly correlated electron system. The study indicates that the magnetic treatment reduces the charge-ordered insulator (COI) and thereafter impedes the growth of ferromagnetic metal (FMM) phase from the COI phase in the subsequent cooling. As a consequence, it miniaturizes the FMM domains, change the magnetic scattering of carriers and reduces the electron-like carriers transformed from the hole-like carriers, which raises the Seebeck coefficient and reduces the thermal conductivity and therefore raises the thermoelectric efficiency.
210	Precision control of nano-positioning stage : an iterative learning-based model predictive control approach	Due to nonlinearities such as hysteresis and creep effect, it is difficult to achieve precise control of nano-positioning stages, e.g., piezo actuators, for high-speed/bandwidth trajectory tracking. In this paper, we propose an iterative learning-based model predictive control (IL-MPC) approach to achieve this goal by addressing the control issues raised by the nonlinear dynamics. IL-MPC strategically combines both model predictive control (MPC) and iterative learning control (ILC) tools: the MPC is applied to a piezo actuator to ensure the tracking error is limited through all iterations and the ILC is applied to the system consists of the MPC and the piezo actuator to guarantee high precision trajectory tracking with the existence of MPC modeling uncertainty and system nonlinearity. Moreover, the MPC also ensures the fast convergence of the ILC. Superior than conventional iterative learning-based control techniques, the proposed IL-MPC can be implemented for tracking both repetitive trajectories and those with variations of nano-positioning stages with high accuracy. Thesupper bound of the tracking error with respect to the variation of the desired trajectory is derived to demonstrate the convergence and accuracy of IL-MPC. For experimental validation and demonstration, IL-MPC was implemented to control a nano-piezo actuator to tracksboth repetitive high-speed/broadband trajectories and trajectories with varying amplitude, phase and frequency, respectively.
211	A new low-cost method of fabricating micro-nano electro- hydrodynamic jet needle	Electro-hydrodynamic (EHD) jet is widely used for direct writing of micro and nano structures. However, the application of EHD jet is limited by its high-cost production process. To overcome the drawbacks mentioned above, a new fabrication method of polymer EHD jet needle is proposed in this paper. A silicon nano mold is firstly produced by inclined deposition technique, and a micro-nano PDMS mold is developed by casting double-layer PDMS on the silicon nano mold with a photomask film between the two PDMS layers. Using the micro-nano PDMS mold, an EHD jet needle can be fabricated in SU-8 photoresist layers by thermal nanoimprinting and ultraviolet lithography. The final SU-8 needle consists of hybrid micro-nano channels, in which the nano channels are 380 nm in width and 72 nm in depth. This low-cost fabrication method of micro-nano needle may have a great contribution to direct write-on-demand nano-patterning technology.
212	Exploring the interactions of oxygen with defective ZnO nanoparticles	The interactions of environmental oxygen with vacuum-annealed defective ZnO have been studied by electrical methods, vacuum Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and in situ adsorption experiments. It was found that the vacuum-annealed defective ZnO exhibits varied electrical response at different temperature, which, by vacuum IR investigation, was ascribed to the subtle balance between formation of oxygen vacancies and their interactions with environmental oxygen. Further studies showed that two microscopic steps including surface adsorption and bulk diffusion were dominating the interactions between defective ZnO and environmental oxygen, and the corresponding apparent activation energy were estimated by in situ adsorption experiments to be 0.093 eV and 0.67 eV.
213	Raman spectroscopy of defective graphite surfaces supporting platinum nanoparticles	Ion-beam-induced defects in carbon supports for Pt nanoparticles have been found to promote Pt&minus;C bonding and enhance catalytic activity during the oxygen reduction reaction. This work used Raman spectroscopy to examine highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) following the irradiation with 380 keV argon ions (Ar<sup>+</sup>) and the deposition of platinum (Pt) nanoparticles using radio frequency (rf) magnetron sputtering. The peak broadening of the resulting spectra indicated that the surface structure of the HOPG was damaged during the Pt deposition process. Therefore, we suggest that Raman spectroscopy should be performed after the Pt deposition to assess the surface structures of carbon supports for Pt nanoparticle catalysts.
214	<strong>High-temperature conduction behavior of carbon nanotube fiber from 25 &ordm;C to 1100 &ordm;C</strong>	The high-temperature conduction behaviors of pure CNT fiber and CNT/SiC and CNT/C composite-fibers from 25 &ordm;C to 1100 &ordm;C in N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere are reported for the first time. The results show a significant increase in the electrical conductivities of CNT fibers in the temperature regime, as the semi-conductive SiC and conductive C matrix were introduced. As the temperature increased, the conductivities of all fibers increase with temperature up to a critical temperature, <em>T<sub>c</sub></em>, was reached, beyond which, a dramatic decrease in the conductivities was observed. The conduction behavior of all fibers can be well explained by the three-dimensional variable range hopping mechanism at the temperature below <em>T<sub>c</sub></em>, and followed a heterogeneous mechanism above <em>T<sub>c</sub></em>. Interestingly, <em>T<sub>c</sub></em> was reduced after the introduction of SiC and C matrix, and this is explained by the competing effect of the internal nanotube resistance and the contact resistance between nanotubes that decreases with the introduction of SiC and C matrix. We propose that the study of high-temperature conduction behaviors of the CNT fibers aid to improve their conductivities and applications at high-temperatures, and the presented conduction mechanisms could be used for other kinds of CNT-structured fibers.
215	The research of quenching effect in Gradient-Band-Gap CdSSe nanowire	Quenching effect of photoconductive semiconductor material has an important application value in detecting semiconductor defect and infrared light. In this paper, we improve Vapor-Liquid-Solid (VLS) method to grow nanowires. Our experiment vessel is a heat resisting quartz tube. With the conditions of gold catalysis, appropriate temperature, and other practical handle, we grow Gradient-Band-Gap CdSSe nanowires successfully. We choose a 310 um nanowire to research its quenching effect. Refer to waveguiding excitation, we study quenching effects of different component parts of the nanowire respectively. Below 10<sup>-8</sup>w power injection, we find that if we increase light intensities of different band gap nanowires, the quenching degree will increase at the same time. However, the peak of quenched rate for 90% CdS proportion nanowire arrivals earlier than 90% CdSe proportion. Even in 10<sup>-6</sup> w light, the peak of quenched rate for CdSe still does not appear. The reason is that with the increase of CdS, more recombination centers turn into the trap energy level centers, so more electrons can jump to the conduction band. This result can help us to make the high-resolution infrared detector under the limited material, and provide convenience for detecting the defect level of semiconductor materials effectively.
216	Citric acid induced W<sub>18</sub>O<sub>49 </sub>electrochromic films with enhanced optical modulation	Electrochromic materials exhibit promising applications in energy-saving fields for its ability to control heat from outdoors. Nanostructured W<sub>18</sub>O<sub>49 </sub>has drawn attention for its one-dimensional structure to transfer charge efficiently as a remarkable electrochromic material. W<sub>18</sub>O<sub>49 </sub>bi-layer films were fabricated through a facile one-step solvothermal process with citric acid as a chelate agent. The results indicated that citric acid could induce the increased deposition on the substance and nanostructured film with denser layer at the bottom and tussock-like upper layer. The bi-layer film exhibited an enhanced optical modulation of 68.7%, a coloration efficiency of 82.1 cm<sup>2</sup>/C, and fast bleaching and coloration switching time (1.4 s and 2.3 s), with expectation to be applied in electrochromic field.
217	Analysis of mixed convection flow in an inclined lid-driven enclosure with Buongiorno's nanofluid model	The mixed convection flow of a nanofluid in an inclined cavity with its sidewalls being sinusoidally heated and linearly distributed of nanoparticle volume fraction is considered. The Buongiorno's model which is the most plausible with reasonable explanation on the slip mechanisms between nanoparticles and fluid medium is applied to formulate the problem. The buoyancy item is simplified by the Boussinesq approximation in an easier and convenient way to illustrate the density variation of nanoparticles with fewer coefficients being involved.&nbsp;The accurate solutions are obtained by the newly developed wavelet-homotopy technique, which are in full agreement with previous studies.&nbsp;Parametrical studies are given on the regimes of the complex flow field, heat and nanoparticle volume fraction. Discussion of applicability of the nanofluid model is presented. Effects of different parameters such as the Grashof number, the slipping parameters, the nanoparticles related parameters, the inclination, the boundary coefficients including amplitude ratios of temperature and concentration, along with the phase deviation are investigated on the fluid field focusing on the fluid flow along with heat and mass transfer characteristics.
218	<strong>Highly Enhanced Room-Temperature Photoluminescence in V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> Nanospheres</strong>	The room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) in V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> nanostructures with one- and zero-like dimensional structures were investigated. A large increase of the V<sup>4+</sup> oxidation state in nanowires and nanospheres was observed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> nanowires and nanospheres revealed highly enhanced PL intensity compared with the nanoparticles and nanorods. In particular, V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> nanospheres and nanowires showed intense ultraviolet (UV) PL near 396 nm (3.13 eV), and the UV PL intensity was more intense in the nanospheres. The intense UV PL in V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> nanospheres was attributed to enhanced transition probability in terms of the large increase of the V<sup>4+</sup> (3<em>d</em><sup>1</sup>) oxidation state. The PL properties in V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> nanostructures showed strong dependencies on the oxidation state and morphology.
219	Mn-doped SnS2 nanostructure as a potential efficiency CO catalyst:sa first-principles study	The SnS2 is a new class of 2D materials with unique properties, which are still largely unexplored in the CO catalyst field. The modulation of electronic structures and chemical activities of the Mn atom substituted for S atom in SnS2 monolayer sheet is studied based on density functional theory. The electrons of doped Mn are introduced to the dangling bond of monovacancy SnS2 system, which can enhance the stability of Mn-Sn bond. The Mn-SnS2 monolayer sheet prefers good catalytic activity for the CO oxidation via the more favorable Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism with a two-step route to the Eley-Rideal or the latest report of termolecular Eley-Rideal mechanisms. In summary, we show first-principles evidence toward the realization of SnS2 based catalyst for CO catalytic oxidation which can be facilitating the applications of SnS2 in the fields of catalysis and air pollution prevention.
220	<strong>Phase Change Induced Quantization in NIR Emitting Ag<sub>2</sub>S Nanocrystals: An Understanding via Structural and Optical Response</strong>	Quantum dots sensitized solar cells with low cost and simultaneously achieving high power conversion efficiency have been of great interest. The origination of quantum confinement in a system dramatically improves its physical properties. Here we report the phase change induced quantization in NIR emitting Ag<sub>2</sub>S quantum dots (QDs) by analysing their structural and optical response. Ag<sub>2</sub>S QDs have been synthesized by bottom-up technique. Structural and morphology of nanocrystals have been investigated by XRD, TEM and Raman spectroscopy. The size-dependent excited state optical properties of Ag<sub>2</sub>S QDs have been systematically investigated by UV-VIS-NIR spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL). Experimentally, we determine the quantum confinement in the Ag<sub>2</sub>S QDs due to change in phase and change in the size of the particles. The synthesized QDs via this mode may be suitable for capturing solar energy, especially in NIR region.
221	<strong>Reliable information encryption and digital display applications based on multistate smart windows</strong>	A multistate smart window based on the reversible electrodepositing metal device (REMD) with excellent electrochromic performance is reported. A thiol modified ITO glass acts as positive electrode and an ITO nanoparticles coated ITO glass serves as negative electrode. The REMD can exhibit 4 different color states. Its mirror state presents a higher reflectance than the commercial Ag-based mirror and the transmittance of its transparent state can reach as high as 82.9 %. Moreover, the REMD can work steadily without any decline in light-modulation performance after 1000 cycles. Notably, a reliable information encryption device and novel digital display is proposed and designed. The REMD will provide broader potential applications in electrochromic smart windows.
222	<strong>Atomic Study of Structural Evolution of Nano- and Single-crystalline Au Nanowires Under Torsion</strong>	The effect of temperature on the structural evolution of nanocrystalline (NC) and single-crystalline (SC) Au nanowires (NWs) under torsional deformation is studied using molecular dynamics simulations based on the many-body embedded-atom potential. The effect is investigated using common neighbor analysis and discussed in terms of shear strain distribution and atomic flow field. The simulation results show that deformation for NC NWs is mainly driven by the nucleation and propagation of dislocations and the gliding of grain boundaries (GBs) and that for SC NWs is mainly driven by dislocations and the formation of disordered structures. Dislocations for NC and SC NWs easily nucleate at GBs and free surfaces, respectively. For NC NWs, torsional buckling occurs easily at GBs with large gliding. SC NWs have a more uniform and larger elastic deformation under torsion compared to that for NC NWs due to the former&rsquo;s lack of grains. SC NWs have a long period of elastic deformation transforming into plastic deformation. Increasing temperature facilitates stress transmission throughout NWs.
223	Laser-to-droplet alignment sensitivity in laser-produced plasma sources of extreme ultraviolet light	We present and experimentally validate a model describing the sensitivity of the tilt angle, expansion and propulsion velocity of a tin micro-droplet irradiated by a 1 &mu;m Nd:YAG laser pulse to its relative alignment. This sensitivity is particularly relevant in industrial plasma sources of extreme ultraviolet light for nanolitho- graphic applications. Our model has but a single parameter: the dimensionless ratio of the laser spot size to the effective size of the droplet, which is related to the position of the plasma critical density surface. Our model enables the development of straightforward scaling arguments in turn enabling precise control the alignment sensitivity.
224	High-performance gadolinium doped indium oxide nanofibers&nbsp;field-effect transistors and their application in logic gate	One-dimensional metal oxide&nbsp;nanofibers (NFs) have been regarded as promising building&nbsp;blocks for large&nbsp;area and low&nbsp;cost electronic devices. As one of the representative metal oxide semiconducting materials, In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;based materials attracted much interest due to their excellent electrical and optical properties.&nbsp;However, most of the field-effect transistors (FETs)&nbsp;based on In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;NFs&nbsp;usually operate in the depletion mode, which lead to large power consumption and complicated integrated circuit (IC) design.&nbsp;In this report, gadolinium&nbsp;(Gd) doped In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;(InGdO) NFs were fabricated by electrospinning and applied as the channels&nbsp;in FETs. By adjusting the doping concentration and the NFs density, the device performance was precisely manipulated. It was found that the FETs&nbsp;based on the InGdO NFs with Gd doping concentration of 3% and NFs density of 2.9 &micro;m<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;exhibited the best device performance, including a field-effect mobility (&micro;<sub>FE</sub>) of 2.83 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs, an on/off current ratio (I<sub>on</sub>/I<sub>off</sub>)&nbsp;of ~ 4&times;10<sup>8</sup>, a threshold voltage (V<sub>TH</sub>)&nbsp;of 5.8 V, and a subthreshold swing (SS)&nbsp;of 2.4 V/decade. By employing the high-<em>k </em>ZrO<sub>x</sub>&nbsp;thin films as the gate dielectrics in FETs, the m<sub>FE</sub>, V<sub>TH</sub>&nbsp;and SS can be further improved to be 17.4 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs, 0.7 V and 160&nbsp;mV/decade, respectively. To demonstrate the potential application of the InGdO&nbsp;NFs/ZrO<sub>x</sub>&nbsp;FETs,&nbsp;the inverter based on the FETs was constructed and a gain of ~ 11 was achieved.
225	<strong>Conductivity of disordered nanowire networks: the dependence on length ratio of conducting paths to whole nanowires</strong>	Conducting behavior of disordered nanowire networks is found to be determined by the length ratio of conducting paths to whole nanowires in the networks, which is concluded from combined studies of simulation and experiment. An algorithm is designated for the simulation where evolution dynamics of conducting paths and network conductance could be monitored at the same time. It is found that, with increment of nanowire length (at given area fraction), conducting paths grow more slowly than the percolated clusters, but they play a key role in the conductivity. Normalized network conductivity of the disordered nanowire network is found to function linearly with the length-ratio of conducting paths to the whole nanowires. And this relationship has been verified by experiments where network were built up from random aligned silver nanowires. In addition, the newly proposed relationship could be used to anticipate theoretical conductivity of given disordered nanowire network, as well as the average junction resistance between nanowires. The relationship happens to be very similar to the Effective Medium Theory proposed by Kirkpatrick (1973), but the deterministic parameter shall be changed from filling probability to the length ratio. The difference lies on that length ratio only concerns on conducting paths, rather than either dead ends or branches. At last, the length ratio functioned relationship could be treated as a&nbsp;basic tool to describe the conducting behavior of disordered nanowire networks.
226	<strong>High Strength Fiber Reinforced Composites with Surface Fibrilized Aramid Fibers</strong>	Debonding of the fiber-matrix interface is a common issue in composites, especially for aramid fiber reinforced composites due to their smooth and inert surface . Here, a novel surface treatment is developed for aramid fibers in order to enhance interfacial properties in composites while preserving the fiber&rsquo;s tensile strength. The fibrilization approach follows recent work on aramid nanofibers and uses a solution of potassium hydroxide and dimethyl sulfoxide at room temperature.&nbsp; This process is perfomred to exfoliate the surface fibrils such that a psudo-wiskerized fiber is prepared which provides mechanical interlocking with the matrix.&nbsp; The surface bound fibrils also contain increased polar functional groups which additionally provides improved wetting due to enhanced compatibility of the fiber with the matrix as well as offering reactive sites to allow covalent bonding with reactive themrosets such as epoxy. It is shown that the surface fibrilated fibers possess an 128% improved interfacial shear strength with an epoxy matrix, as well as an 62% increased short beam strength, compared to untreated fiber reinforced composites. The tensile strength of the treated fibers is demonstrated to be preserved, ensuring a significant improvement in common failure modes without a degradation of in-plane properties. The results indicate the potential of this treatment as a simple, fast, and cost-effective method to improve not only the interface in aramid fiber reinforced polymer matrix composites but also the bulk laminated composite.
227	Systematic Investigation of Plasmonic Amplification in Al, Rh, Ag, and Au Nanoparticle Dimers and Design Rules for UV-Visible Plasmonics	It is now well established that, due to excitation of localized surface plasmon resonances in plasmonic nanosystems, the electric field from an external irradiation source is greatly amplified in their vicinity. Surface plasmon mediated electric field amplification near plasmonic nanosystems is of vital importance for; light absorption enhancement in solar cells, molecular detection using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, proximity measurement of biological macromolecules such as proteins, lipids and nucleic acids using plasmon enhanced FRET, cancer therapy using photo-thermal effects, just to name only a few applications. In comparison to an isolated spherical shaped nanoparticle, their aggregate provide greater field enhancement, wider spectral tuning, and multiple resonant features. In view of the superior plasmonic characteristics of dimer configuration, a systematic investigation of plasmonic amplification due to, Al, Rh, Ag and Au nanoparticles in dimer configuration has been done, and their suitability and scope for UV-Visible applications is assessed. The dependence of plasmonic amplification and spectral tuning on crucial dimer parameters e.g., particle size, embedding medium, and particle-particle separation is expressed in terms of fitting expressions, which can be used for designing dimer based systems for UV-Visible spectral window. Moreover, dimer designs optimized for certain specific wavelengths using fitting expressions developed here are presented.
228	Optical observation of Brownian rotation of magnetic nanoparticles in water under a damped oscillating magnetic field.	It is important to understand the rotation mechanism of magnetic nanoparticle especially its Brownian rotation in liquid under an alternating magnetic field for the success of the biomedical application such as magnetic hyperthermia treatment and magnetic particle imaging. Although many effort has paid to observe the Brownian rotation by using ac magnetization measurement, it is hard to separate the contributions of the Brownian rotation and the N&eacute;el rotation on the magnetization signal. In this study, we measured optical transmittance of magnetic nanoparticle dispersion under a damped oscillating magnetic field with Faraday configuration. Since the time variation of the transmittance reflects the orientation of the easy axis along the magnetic field, the rotation dynamics can be observed with light. The observed rotation behavior, which exhibits the butterfly-shaped hysteresis, is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction by Mamiya. Furthermore, we were able to evaluate the order parameter of the easy axis thanks to the high initial amplitude of the damped oscillating magnetic field.
229	Enhancing the sensitivity of single electron spin sensor by multi-frequency control	The negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond is increasingly attracting as a solid state quantum sensor for high sensitivity and nanoscale application. However, the coupling with host non-zero nuclear spin of NV center decreases the signal contrast and the sensing sensitivity. Here, we apply multi-frequency synchronous manipulation on the NV center to recover the signal contrast and enhance the sensitivity. A sensitivity enhancement factor of 2.7 is achieved at low magnetic field, compared to the single microwave driven sensing process. The sensing sensitivity at varies magnetic field approaches that is obtained with full signal contrast. Such a multi-frequency controlled sensitivity enhancement also works on the sensing of temperature, strain and electric field and the application of other spin-spin coupling systems.
230	<strong>Unusually large magnetoresistance of FeCo nanocrystals encapsulated by the graphene layers in the FeCo-graphene nanocomposites</strong>	Graphene-coated FeCo nanocrystals of core-shell structure have been synthesized through an improved process of thermal decomposition of a Prussian blue analogue. The magnetic, transport and magneto-transport properties have been studied for the FeCo-graphene nanocomposites from different preparation conditions. Large magnetoresistance (MR) of -9.6% at room temperature is observed on the samples synthesized at 1000<sup>o</sup>C and with post-annealing. Furthermore all of the FeCo-graphene samples exhibit unusual enhancement of MR effect with the rise of temperature. The authors suggest that high MR is attributed to improved quality of the FeCo-graphene interface and efficient carrier hopping in graphene matrix for these hierarchical-structure nanocomposites.
231	<strong>Fabrication and characterization of ZnS/ZnO core shell </strong><strong>nanostructures on silver wires</strong>	In this research, ZnS nanoparticles were synthesized on ZnO/silver wires to form ZnS/ZnO core shell structures on silver wires. Various outward appearance and colors could be observed by different ZnO growth and sulfurization conditions. To evaluate the properties of these nanostructures, the optical properties and chemical bindings were analyzed by photoluminescence, Raman analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, material characterizations including transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction confirmed that cubic ZnS (311)/ ZnO nanostructures were grown on silver wires for the first time. ZnS/ZnO core shell structures on silver wires are promising for future optoelectronic and biomedical applications.
232	Structural anomalies in exfoliated WS<sub>2</sub>: High pressure investigations on monolayer and nanocrystalline tungsten disulfide	A detailed high pressure X-ray diffraction and Raman Spectroscopy studies are carried out on monolayer WS<sub>2</sub> and nanocrystalline WS<sub>2</sub>. The monolayer sample is obtained by liquid exfoliation. Photoluminiscence and Raman measurements show it to consist of monolayer. High pressure X-ray diffraction measurements in conjunction with Raman studies show the emergence of a triclinic modification along with the hexagonal phase of WS<sub>2</sub> above about 5.8 GPa. However analysis of our ambient and high pressure studies on monolayer WS<sub>2</sub> along with those of the nanocrystalline sample indicate to the presence of the triclinic phase in patches embedded in the parent hexagonal phase raising a question mark over the structural purity of the exfoliated monolayered materials beyond a certain stress conditions. Raman mode values and their FWHM of the monolayer sample show anomalous changes at about 27 GPa, the pressure where the sample completely gets converted to the triclinic structure indicating importance of strain in the structural as well as electronic properties of two dimensional materials.
233	<strong>Evidence of self biased converse magnetoelectric response in P(VDF-TrFe)/ SmFeO<sub>3</sub> nanocomposite films </strong>	In this study, we investigate magnetoelectric (ME) properties in nanocomposite films (P(VDF-TrFE))/SmFeO<sub>3</sub> consist of ferroelectric copolymer, poly(vinylindene &#xFB02;uoride-tri&#xFB02;uoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) and magnetic SmFeO<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles. Comparative magnetization vs magnetic field hysteresis loops for un-poled and electric field poled (P(VDF-TrFE))/SmFeO<sub>3</sub> nanocomposite films demonstrate strong electric filed control of magnetization. The nanocomposite films exhibit large exchange biasing (EB) effects in magnetic measurements near spin switching temperature (~100 K) of SmFeO<sub>3</sub> and the EB effects were significantly modified under electric field (E) poled conditions (at E=200 kV/cm), indicating ME coupling. Remarkably, we observe electric field poling induced self biased converse ME effect in the (P(VDF-TrFE))/SmFeO<sub>3</sub> nanocomposite films. The maximum magnetoelectric output voltage (&alpha;) obtained is 55 mVcm<sup>-1</sup>Oe<sup>-1</sup> at H<sub>bias</sub>= 1 kOe and 25 mVcm<sup>-1</sup>Oe<sup>-1 </sup>at H<sub>bias</sub>= 0, after electric field poling. The discovery of self biasing phenomenon with converse ME effects at room temperature in flexible (P(VDF-TrFE))/SmFeO<sub>3 </sub>nanocomposite films is highly desirable for device applications such as electrically controlled thin memory devices and ME sensors etc.
234	The effect of ethanol on the structure and physical properties of carbon nanocoils	As an exotic quasi-1D nanomaterials, carbon nanocoils (CNCs) have special helical morphology and polycrystalline-amorphous structure. In this paper, the effect of ethanol on the structure and physical properties of CNCs is investigated. CNCs are soaked by ethanol for different time. The internal structural characterization shows that ethanol permeates into CNCs through defects and vacancies. The permeation of ethanol increases the inner stress inside CNCs and leads to the rearrangement of <em>sp<sup>2</sup></em><sup> </sup>grains to alleviate the stress. As a result, the coherence of graphite grains is improved. Meanwhile, the permeation of ethanol molecules separates <em>sp<sup>2</sup></em> grains and graphite layers in a grain. After long time soak, the chemical structure of CNCs shows slow change. The contents of C-O- and C=O bonds are all increased, resulting in the atomic ratio of C to O decreasing from 48 to 29 for 346 days soak. The increase of C-O- and C=O bonds promotes the transformation of <em>sp<sup>2</sup></em> sites to other saturation sites. As results of both physical and chemical changes of structure, the concentration of conduction electrons is decreased, the electron hopping barrier and phonon scattering are increased, leading to the significantly decrease of electrical conductivity and thermal diffusivity.
235	<strong>Effect of </strong><strong>Ag nanoparticle </strong><strong>s</strong><strong>elf-generation on the low-temperature pressureless Ag </strong><strong>sintering process</strong>	In this study, a&nbsp;self-generation phenomenon of Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) with a size less than 10 nm was observed in the Ag sintering process under an air atmosphere, which corresponds to a stronger sintered Ag tension and shear strength than that sintered in nitrogen. It is confirmed that oxygen plays an important role in the generation of AgNPs. It is also revealed from transmission electron microscopy observations that many AgNPs accumulate around the grains and grain boundaries of the Ag sintered in air, which promotes connection and necking among Ag particles. The generation mechanism of AgNPs was analyzed, and the results indicate that AgNPs may form because of the oxidation and reduction processes of Ag grains and the compression stress release at the grain boundaries. This work will be helpful to understand the bonding mechanism of using Ag sintering technology under low-temperature pressureless conditions.
236	<strong>Magnetoresistive Sensors for Biomedicine</strong>	Currently there is a plethora of sensors (e.g. electrochemical, optical, piezoelectric etc.) used in life sciences for either analyte detection or diagnostic purposes but in the last decade magnetic biosensors have received extended interest as a promising candidate for the development of next-generation, highly sensitive biomedical platforms. This approach is based on magnetic labeling, replacing the otherwise classic fluorescence labeling, combined with magnetic sensors that detect the stray field of the superparamagnetic markers (e.g. magnetic micro-nanoparticles or magnetic nanostructures). Apart from the increased sensitivity, magnetic biosensors exhibit the unique ability of controlling and modulating the superparamagnetic markers by an externally applied magnetic force as well as the capability of compact integration of their electronics on a single chip. The magnetic field sensing mechanism most widely investigated for applications in life sciences is based on the magnetoresistance (MR) effect that was first discovered in 1856 by Lord Kelvin. However, it is the giant magnetoresistance effect (GMR), discovered by Gr&uuml;nberg and Fert in 1988, that actually exhibits the greatest potential as a biosensing principle. This perspective, will shortly explain the magnetic labeling method and will provide a brief overview of the different MR sensor technologies (giant magnetoresistive - GMR, spin valves and tunnel magnetoresistive -TMR) mostly used in biosensing applications as well as a compact assessment of the state of the art. Newly implemented innovations and their broad-ranging implications will be discussed, challenges that need to be addressed will be identified and new hypotheses will be proposed.
237	Observation of 2-D deposition patterns from doped superfluid helium droplets	Superfluid helium droplets have now emerged as a unique tool for the fabrication of nanomaterials. Unlike conventional synthetic methods, by this approach nanomaterials are formed in very cold superfluid helium by the addition of atoms one by one, which subsequently aggregate into nanostructures. Experiments have confirmed that quantized vortices are present in large helium droplets, which can serve as the intrinsic templates for the fabrication of 1-D nanomaterials. A recent X-ray diffraction experiment revealed arrays of quantized vortices in nanoscale helium droplets. However, all of the deposition experiments using large helium droplets so far show isolated nanowires, which are consistent the presence of only one vortex line in each helium droplet. This apparent contradiction provokes important questions about how vortices behave when confined to the nanoscale. Here we investigated the formation of Ag and Au nanoparticles in large helium droplets and examined deposition patterns at different expansion zones of the droplet beam, in order to learn how the rotational states of superfluid helium droplets vary with the selected droplets. After being deposited on a thin solid surface, the resulting nanoparticles were then imaged by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The major findings include: 1) 2-D scattered patterns were observed using droplets at the central zone of the droplet beam for the first time, which are consistent with the presence of an array of quantized vortices in the droplet; and 2) at an off-centre position a single nanowire is formed, indicating that helium droplets each contains a single vortex line when droplets are formed at the edge of the droplet beam. This work provides new insights to quantized vortices in nanoscale superfluid helium and offers extra dimension for the formation of novel nanostructures using superfluid helium droplets as nano-reactors.
238	Bending stability of CuxCrO2 - a transparent p-type conducting oxide for large area flexible electronics	The best performing p-type transparent conducting oxides are crystalline materials, deposited at high temperatures, incompatible with the drive to low cost flexible electronics. We investigated a nanocrystalline, copper deficient CuxCrO2 , deposited at low temperatures upon flexible polyimide. The as-deposited film without post annealing has a conductivity of 6 Scm&#x2212;1 . We demonstrate that this p-type transparent oxide retains its excellent electrical conductivity under tensile strain, withstanding over a thousand bending cycles. In contrast, compressive strain is shown to lead to an immediate reduction in conductivity which we attribute to a de-lamination of the thin film from the substrate.
239	Peristaltic nano fluid flow of a six constant Jeffreys fluid model in a non-uniform vertical tube	This study deals with the peristaltic nano fluid flow of an incompressible six constant Jeffrey's fluid through a non-uniform vertical tube. The fluid flow is due to the sinusoidal wave traveling with constant speed c of propagation along the walls of the tube. The partial differential equations governing the flow are rst modeled in the cylindrical coordinate system and then simplied by using the assumption of low Reynolds number and long wave length. The resulting equations are solved analytically by utilizing the homotopy perturbation technique (HPM). The obtained expressions for the velocity, temperature, and nanoparticles concentration proles are sketched through graphs and the impact of various emerging parameters are investigated for changed peristaltic waves. Streamlines have been also plotted at the end of the paper.
240	Tuning of band gap in two-dimensional photonic crystals composed of nanolayer graphene coated anisotropic tellurium rods	Using the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map method, the photonic band structure of two-dimensional photonic crystals with square and triangular lattices made of circular graphene-coated anisotropic tellurium rods embedded in air background, are calculated. We have selected transverse magnetic mode of electromagnetic waves and the resulting band structures showed the existence of two band gaps in the frequency spectrum, called Bragg photonic band gap and graphene-induced photonic band gap. It is shown that these photonic band gaps are widely tunable and their bandwidth can be adjusted by changing the chemical potential of graphene nanolayers using an applied gate voltage.
241	Interaction between &#x03B2;-cyclodextrin and cholesterol domain. sA molecular dynamics simulation study	Using the molecular dynamics simulation method we studied the system composed of &#x03B2;-cyclodextrin (&#x03B2;CD) molecules and cholesterol clusters, both standalone and in a water environment. We have found that &#x03B2;CD molecules do not penetrate the interior of cholesterol cluster, rather stick or "glue" to these cholesterol molecules that make up the surface of the cluster. Moreover, our simulations have shown that the ability of &#x03B2;CD to pull cholesterol molecule out of the cluster surface is rather marginal. Consequently, some chemical modifications of &#x03B2;-cyclodextrin molecule should be considered while searching for the oligosaccharide based tools (nanomedicine) able to effectively influence cholesterol deposit in the inner part of blood arteries.
242	Design of a patterned nanostructure array using a nanosecond pulsed laser	We investigated the influence of phase shift between scattered lights using gold lines (GLs) spacings. At a spacing of 5,787 nm, ten nanodot (ND) arrays were formed at intervals of 533 nm by nanosecond pulsed laser. The results show that the formation of the patterned nanostructure array (PNSA) was affected by the resonance of scattered light. We conclude that ND arrays were formed with a spacing of &#x039B; = n&#x03BB;.sAnd we have designed PNSA comprising two ND arrays on a Si substrate. The PNSA with dimensions of 1,600 nm &#x00D7; 1,600 nm was prepared using 30-nm-wide GLs.
243	Three-dimensional single-molecule localization with nanometer accuracy using Metal-Induced Energy Transfer (MIET) Imaging	Our paper presents the first theoretical and experimental study of using single-molecule Metal-Induced Energy Transfer (smMIET) for localizing single fluorescent molecules in three dimensions. Metal-Induced Energy Transfer uses the fact that the emission properties of fluorescent molecules are strongly modulated by the presence of a metal, with a strong dependence of this modulation on the dye-metal distance. We have used this method in the past for localizing fluorescent emitters with nanometer accuracy along the optical axis of a microscope. The combination of smMIET with existing single-molecule localization based super-resolution methods that provide nanometer lateral localization accuracy offers the prospect of achieving isotropic nanometer localization accuracy in all three spatial dimensions. We give a thorough theoretical explanation and analysis of smMIET, describe its experimental requirements, also in its combination with lateral single-molecule localization techniques, and we present first proof-of-principle experiments using dye molecules immobilized on top of a silica spacer, and of dye molecules embedded in thin polymer films.
244	Effect of surface hydroxyl groups on heat capacity of mesoporous silica	This paper quantifies the effect of surface hydroxyl groups on the effective specific and volumetric heat capacities of mesoporous silica. To achieve a wide range of structural diversity mesoporous silica samples were synthesized by various methods, including (i) polymer-templated nanoparticle-based powders, (ii) polymer-templated sol-gel powders, and (iii) ambigel silica samples dried by solvent exchange at room temperature. Their effective specific heat capacity, the specific surface area, and the porosity were measured using differential scanning calorimetry and low-temperature nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements, respectively. The experimentally measured specific heat capacity was larger than the conventional weight-fraction-weighted specific heat of the air and silica constituents. The difference was attributed to the presence of OH groups at the large internal surface area. A thermodynamic model was developed based on surface energy considerations to account for the effect of surface OH groups on the specific and volumetric heat capacity. The model predictions fell within the experimental uncertainty.
245	Self-referencing 3D optical imaging microscopy	Quantitative 3D imaging of cells provides important morphological information about them, leading to their characterization, comparison and identification. Interference principle when applied to microscopy provides high contrast quantitative phase images of otherwise transparent objects along with their thickness information. Two-beam off-axis geometry of interference microscopes, in which the light beam interacting with the object interferes with a separate reference beam, are preferred since it leads to single shot quantitative phase imaging methodologies. But these techniques lead to bulky setups, with lower temporal stability not suitable for measurement of nanometer level cell thickness fluctuations. Self-referencing interference microscopes manipulates a portion of the light beam interacting with the cells to act as the reference, leading to compact, temporally stable geometries ideal for measurement of cell dynamics. Here we give an overview of our efforts in the development of such microscopes and their use in 3D cell imaging.
246	<strong>Determination of the tunneling decay length for nanocomposites Au-PMMA</strong>	In this work nanocomposites formed by gold ion implantation in PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate), using low energy, are analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, concerning to the nanoparticles size and distribution. Different implantation doses (<em>x</em>) were used and parameters as number of gold nanoparticles per area <em>r</em>, diameter distribution <em>D</em>(<em>x</em>) and the distances between the surfaces of the metallic nanoparticles <em>&delta;</em>(<em>x</em>), among others parameters, were obtained. It was possible to observe that, as the dose increases, the particles diameter increases, the most probable nearest neighbors distance <em>d</em> decreases and the number of particles per area <em>r</em> also decreases. With the results, it was also possible to calculate the tunneling decay length <em>&xi;</em> and the electron affinity<em> &epsilon;</em> of the PMMA modified by the gold ion implantation.
247	A First-Principles Analysis of Ballistic Conductance, Grain Boundary Scattering andVertical Resistance in Aluminum Interconnects	We present an ab initio evaluation of electron scattering mechanisms in Al interconnects from a back-end-of-line (BEOL) perspective. We consider the ballistic conductance as a function of nanowire size, as well as the impact of surface oxidation on<br />electron transport. We also consider several representative twin grain boundaries and calculate the specific resistivity and reflection coefficients for each case. Lastly, we<br />calculate the vertical resistance across the Al/Ta(N)/Al and Cu/Ta(N)/Cu interfaces, which are representative of typical vertical interconnect structures with diffusion barriers. Despite a high ballistic conductance, the calculated specific resistivities at grain boundaries are 70-100% higher in Al than in Cu, and the vertical resistance across Ta(N) diffusion barriers are 60-100% larger for Al than for Cu. These results suggest that in addition to the well-known electromigration limitations in Al interconnects,<br />electron scattering represents a major problem in achieving low interconnect line resistance at fine dimensions.
248	Chemical potential and free energy of nanoconfined water in Newton black films	In this work we investigate possible approximations to the free energy and chemical potential of water within a Newton black film as a natural nanoconfinement. As a first step we explore the different approximations in a sample of 500 water molecules (bulk water), finding that the overlapping distribution method is the more accurate. For the Newton black film we also calculate the free energy profile of the water molecules along the bilayer normal. We obtain that depending on the position of the water molecule inside the bilayer, the excess chemical potential is lower than that of bulk water, suggesting that a water molecule might be  more stable inside the Newton black film than in bulk. A charged semiflexible amphiphilic model and the TIP5P model of water are used in our simulations.
249	<strong>Thermal processing shifts the resonant wavelength of gold nanoplates</strong>	Gold nanoplates (GNPs) are attractive as wavelength-specific light absorbing coatings for converting incident infrared light to thermal energy. In this work, we show that even relatively low temperature processing (100-400 &ordm;C) can permanently shift the resonant wavelength peak from the infrared to visible wavelengths; our samples shift from 860 to 650 nm after an hour at 350 &ordm;C. The mechanism is melting-induced shape change, which causes rounding of sharp corners and reflow of the plate-like shapes toward spheres with smaller diameters and shorter resonant wavelengths, as well as merging with neighboring particles. Since 150-200 &ordm;C temperatures are commonly attained during the curing step of photoresists in microfabrication, and easily exceeded during curing of polyimide coatings for encapsulation (350 &ordm;C), these wavelength shifts are important to understand when incorporating GNPs into microelectromechanical (MEMS) devices. In addition, 200 &ordm;C temperatures are also reached in applications where localized heating is performed on thermally isolated structures such as micro hotplates. Thus, properly understanding the melting behavior of GNPs enables researchers to address these issues by strategically planning the fabrication process, such as starting with long wavelength particles to accommodate the shift, using low temperature processing methods, and ensuring that the nanoplates are well-dispersed so nanoplate clusters do not sinter together during processing.
250	Electron Scattering at Interfaces in Nano-scale Vertical Interconnects: A Combined Experimental and Ab Initio Study	We present a combined theoretical and experimental study on the electron transport characteristics across several representative interface structures found in back-end-of-line (BEOL) interconnect stacks for advanced semiconductor manufacturing: Cu/Ta(N)/Co/Cu and Cu/Ta(N)/Ru/Cu. In particular, we evaluate the impact of replacing a thin TaN barrier with Ta while considering both Co and Ru as wetting layers. Both theory and experiment indicate a pronounced reduction in vertical resistance when replacing TaN with Ta, regardless of whether a Co or Ru wetting layer is used. This indicates that a significant portion of the total<br />vertical resistance is determined by electron scattering at the Cu/Ta(N) interface. The electronic structure of these nano-sized interconnects is analyzed in terms of the atom-resolved projected density of states and k-resolved transmission spectra at the Fermi level. This work further develops a fundamental understanding of electron transport and material characteristics in nano-sized interconnects.
251	<strong>Electrochemically induced superconductivity in organic-inorganic hybrid halide perovskite (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Pb(SCN)<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub></strong>	Halide perovskites exhibit rich physical properties and have been the foci in search for promising materials for solar cells and Li-ion batteries. We report here that superconductivity with a critical temperature of ~7.2 Kelvin can be induced in halide perovskite (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Pb(SCN)<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2 </sub>electrochemically. Transmission electron microscopy and magnetic hysteresis loop measurements were conducted to understand this observation. We attribute the observed superconductivity to the Li-reduced formation of lead nanoclusters.
252	About 4.688nm&#x00D7;0.626nm Transistor Built up of Ten Doping Atoms in a (8, 0) Single-Wall Carbon Nanotube	The development of silicon based integrated circuits is close to the physical scale limit. Carbon nanotube transistors achieve a characteristic size of 40 nanometers. How to further miniaturization of electronic components on carbon substrates is the key to its further development. We have constructed a double junction structure, in (8, 0) single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) doped with nitrogen, boron and phosphorus atoms, and investigate the electronic transport properties. The current through the doped regions is controlled by gate voltage. When we apply bias (more than 0.8V in the positive direction or 1.2V in the negative direction) onto the structure, and raise the gate voltage from 0V to 1.0V, the current increases in an order of magnitude of 102&#x03BC;A, and the transmission peaks in bias window get wider and higher. If the bias is changed from -1.2V to 0.8V, the structure remains cut-off. The peaks are created by the overlapping of the incomplete bands of the nitrogen-doping region, the boron-doped region and the phosphorus-doping region. Such N, B, and P doped regions (about 46.88 &#x00C5; &#x00D7; 6.26 &#x00C5;) forms atomic scale transistor in the carbon nanotube. The transistor can be used to construct atomic scale functional circuits. We get atomic scale transistor that can operate under normal current and voltage conditions (current: 25-150&#x03BC;A, gate voltage: 0-1V, bias voltage: 1.5-2V).
253	In Vitro Models of Transport across the Blood-Brain Barrier	The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the tightest endothelial barrier in humans. Characterized by the presence of tight endothelial junctions and adherens junctions, the primary function of the BBB is to maintain brain homeostasis through the control of solute transit across the barrier. The specific features of this barrier make for unique modes of transport of solutes, nanoparticles and cells across the BBB. Understanding the different routes of traffic adopted by each of these is therefore critical in the development of targeted therapies. In an attempt to move towards controlled experimental assays, multiple groups are now opting for the use of microfluidic systems. A comprehensive understanding of bio-transport processes across the BBB in microfluidic devices is therefore necessary to develop targeted and efficient therapies for a host of diseases ranging from neurological disorders to the spread of metastases in the brain.
254	Fundamentals and applications of optomechanically induced transparency	Cavity optomechanical systems have been shown to exhibit an analogon to atomic electromagnetically induced transparency that a transmission window for the propagation of the probe field is induced by a strong control field when the resonance condition is met. Sharp transmission features controlled by the control laser beam enable many applications ranging from force sensors to quantum computation and communication. In recent years, there has been significant progress in both theoretical and experimental studies of this phenomenon, driven by the development of nanophotonics as well as the improvement of nano-fabrication techniques. Optomechanically induced transparency has been found to manifest in numerous different physical mechanisms, e.g., nonlinear optomechanically induced transparency, double optomechanically induced transparency, PT symmetric optomechanically induced transparency, and optomechanically induced transparency in various hybrid optomechanical systems, etc. These results offer a pathway towards an integrated quantum optomechanical memory, show the utility of these chip-scale optomechanical systems for optical buffering, amplification, and filtering of microwave-over-optical signals, and may be applicable to modern optical networks and future quantum networks. Here we systematically review the latest research progress on the fundamentals and applications of optomechanically induced transparency. Perspectives and opportunities on future developments are also provided by focusing on several promising topics.
255	Transport of Nitrate and Nitrite Ions through Graphene Nanopores	Nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-) ions are naturally occurring inorganic ions that are part of the nitrogen cycle. High doses of these ions in drinking  water impose a potential risk to public health. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to study the removal of nitrate and nitrite ions from water by using graphene nanosheets (GNS) with hydrogen-functionalized narrow pores in presence of external electric fields. The passage of ions through the pores is investigated through calculations of ion flux and the results are analyzed through calculations of various other properties such as the density of ions and water, ion-water radial distribution functions, two-dimensional density distribution functions and the potentials of mean force of the ions. The simulation results show that the nitrite ions can pass more in numbers than the nitrate ions in a given time through H-functionalized GNS with different pore geometry. The results show that the nitrite ions are selectively removed faster than the nitrate ions despite the former having higher hydration energy in the bulk. This can be explained in terms of the competition between the Z-density of the ions and the free energy barrier calculated from the potential of mean force. Also, an externally applied electric field is found to be important for the selective permeation of nitrite over the nitrate ions. The current study shows that the graphene nanosheets with carefully created pores can be effective in the selective passage of ions from aqueous solutions.
256	Electrical Conductivity in Metals Containing Populous Nanoparticles	Nanoparticle reinforced metals have great potentials to tune metal properties for widespread applications. Significant research has been recently conducted to understand their functional properties, such as electrical property. However, inconsistent arguments and theories exist on how nanoparticles interact with metal matrices to affect their electrical performance, partly due to the difficulty in producing metal samples containing populous dispersed nanoparticles. In this letter, copper and copper alloy samples (Cu, Cu-40Zn, and Cu-60Ag) containing tungsten carbide (WC) nanoparticles of more than 20 vol.% were successfully fabricated. Then, their electrical conductivity was measured. Given the scale of nanoparticles (~50-150 nm) and electronic parameters in metals, a new theoretical model compatible with the Nordheim&rsquo;s rule was established to explain an exponentially decaying electrical conductivity.
257	<strong>Giant enhancement in Goos-Hanchen shift at the singular phase of a nanophotonic cavity</strong>	In this letter, we experimentally demonstrate thirty-fold enhancement in Goos-Hanchen shift at the Brewster angle of a nanophotonic cavity that operates at the wavelength of 632.8 nm. In particular, the point-of-darkness and the singular phase are achieved using a four-layered metal-dielectric-dielectric-metal asymmetric Fabry-Perot cavity. A highly absorbing ultra-thin layer of germanium in the stack gives rise to the singular phase and the enhanced Goos-Hanchen shift at the point-of-darkness. The obtained giant Goos-Hanchen shift in the lithography-free nanophotonic cavity could enable many intriguing applications including cost-effective label-free biosensors.
258	<strong>Surface Plasmon Length: Determinant of Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance Wavelength in V-shape Ag Nanorods</strong>	Geometry size was widely regarded as an essential determinant of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) wavelength in many nanoparticles. In this study, we clarified this concept by demonstrating that resonance wavelength of V-shape Ag nanorods was determined by surface plasmon length, the surface distance between adjacent poles, instead of geometry size. Results showed that for V-shape Ag nanorods, the linearly proportional relationship between resonance wavelength and geometry size no longer held when size greatly decreased. Nonetheless, resonance wavelength was found linearly dependent on surface plasmon length in all situations. This work suggested that attempts of LSPR manipulation should not be restricted to adjustment of geometry size, but any means that could change the surface plasmon length.
259	Colloidal interactions govern the rheology (shear and extensional) and filament-forming capability of cellulose nanofibrils with biopolymer supports	The shear and extensional rheology in dynamic and steady flows were compared for dispersions of semi-rigid fibrils (cellulose nanofibrils, CNF) and two biopolymers (guar gum, GG, and cellulose acetate, CA). Even at low concentrations, the relatively stiffer CNF formed hydrogels with high storage modulus and brittleness. Shear and extensional thinning (flow behavior index 0.2-0.3) were displayed in a wide range of strain rates with a consistency index that depended not only on the CNF solids content but also on the flow type (a decade higher under extensional flow compared to that under shear). Aqueous solutions of GG, the polymer with largest chain flexibility, also displayed shear and extensional thinning, though only at relatively high rates (> 1 s<sup>-1</sup>). Moreover, under small amplitude oscillatory shear, GG had a more viscous response than CNF. Even more Newtonian and viscous behavior was detected in organic solutions of CA, which were suitable dopes for wet-spinning into continuous filaments. Neat CNF hydrogels were difficult to spin continuously unless used in a coaxial configuration, together with GG or CA as a supporting polymer shell. We discuss the role of biopolymer rheological behavior and their interesting synergies which facilitate CNF-based filaments via coaxial spinning.
260	Superlong uniform Light Tunnel Created by Focusing Radially Polarized Vortex Beam	A method of generating a super-long nanoscale light tunnel with longitudinal intensity variation less than three percent of the maximum is presented. A radially polarized vortex beam with topological charge of two can be focused into a relatively short light tunnel when the ring-like annular amplitude filter is used to block the outer annular part of the light beam or when an objective with relatively low numerical aperture is used. A fan-shaped division of the central part of light beam cross section with phase modulation scheme is adopted to generate four relatively short light tunnels simultaneously with exactly the same intensity distribution and optimized axial shift. Based on these foundations, a super-long nanoscale light tunnel with uniform intensity is demonstrated both in simulation and experiment.
261	Quantum Sieving for the Separation of Helium Isotopes	We investigate the passage of a Helium atom through a nano-sized pore in a single atom thick membranes.  The interaction between the atom and the membrane is modeled by an analytical potential, which is obtained by fitting the parameters of the potential to accurate quantum chemical calculations.  Potentials were constructed to mimic the pores in graphenylene and  C<sub>2</sub>N holey sheet. For making the problem tractable, the potential is assumed to have cylindrical symmetry.  This enables us to perform wave packet calculations for the passage, assuming perpendicular incidence of the atom on the membrane.  Further, we also performed full transition state theoretical calculations for the rate of the process.  In these calculations, corrections for tunneling were done by transfer matrix calculations for a one dimensional surface, for motion in the Z-direction, but corrected for zero-point energy for motion in the direction parallel to the surface.  Our calculations show that a full 3D wave packet calculation is essential to capture the full quantum dynamics of the process.  Further, the calculations also suggest that for a pore of sufficiently low activation energy, it should be possible to achieve separation of the isotopes of <i>He</i> by repeated sieving through the membrane, even at room temperature.
262	Growth of S-doped MoO2 Nanosheets with a Controlled Band Gap by CVD	In this work, an investigation of MoO2 nanosheets grown on a SiO2/Si substrate using MoO3 and S powders as the raw materials by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was carried out. The HRTEM, XPS and Raman results revealed that the S-doped MoO2 nanosheets were synthesized at a large scale, and the proportion of S and MoO3 precursors influenced the morphology of the nanosheets. Photoluminescence spectra exhibited fluorescent emissions from the MoO2 nanosheets at room temperature from defects and electron transitions between the valence and conduction bands. UV-visible absorption spectra show that the band gap of the MoO2 nanosheet can be controlled by the S doping concentration.
263	<strong>The Effect of Graphene on </strong><strong>Surface Plasmon Resonance of Metal Nanoparticles</strong>	Two transparent graphene-metal nanoparticles (NPs) hybrid schemes namely Au NPs covered by graphene layers and Au NPs encapsulated by graphene layers are presented and the effect of graphene on the localized surface plasmon resonance of metal NPs is systematically investigated. For both schemes, the direct contact of graphene with Au NPs would strongly tune the resonant frequency due to the electron transfer from Au NPs to graphene. Such electron transfer is demonstrated by comparing the absorption spectra of Au NPs with different free electron densities between calculation results via FDTD simulation and experimental results, comparing Raman and electric properties of graphene between pure graphene and Au-NPs/graphene hybrid nanostructure, correlating the electron doping concentration in graphene with the electron density change in Au NPs, as well as ruling out the possible mechanism of the change of effective refractive index of Au NPs. Such an effective tuning of the resonant frequency may shed light on the future applications of 2D based materials in plasmonic devices.
264	<strong>Experimental investigation of the effects of nanoparticles on nucleate pool boiling phenomenon under subcooled conditions</strong>	Effect of nanoparticles on single bubble-based nucleate pool boiling phenomenon under subcooled conditions has been studied. Water (as the base fluid) and two different concentrations of water-silica nanofluids (0.005 and 0.01% V/V) have been employed as the working fluids. The boiling experiments have been conducted in a specially-designed chamber wherein an ITO-coated heater substrate has been used to induce single bubble nucleation. Measurements have been performed non-intrusively using rainbow schlieren deflectometry. Thus, the thermal gradients have directly been mapped as two-dimensional distribution of hue values recorded in the form of schlieren images. The measurements clearly revealed the plausible influence of nanoparticles on the strength of temperature gradients prevailing in the boiling chamber. As compared to the base fluid, the experiments with dilute nanofluids showed that the suspended nanoparticles tend to diffuse the temperature gradients, both in the vicinity of the heated substrate as well as in the superheated layer enveloping the bubble. An overall reduction in the bubble volume and contact angle was seen with increasing concentrations of nanofluids. The bubble was found to assume more spherical shape at higher concentrations of dilute nanofluids in comparison to its shape with water-based experiments. Clear oscillations of the bubble in the subcooled pool of liquids were observed, the frequency of which was found to be significantly reduced as the nanoparticles concentration was increased from 0 to 0.01% (V/V). A force balance analysis has been performed to elucidate the plausible mechanisms explaining the observed trends of the oscillation frequencies of the vapor bubble.
265	Electro/mechanical mutable properties of black phosphorene by electric field and strain engineering	Phosphorene a two dimensional (2D) arrangement of black phosphorus atoms has greatly manifested extraordinary properties. In this work we investigated the electronic and mechanical properties of a single-layer black phosphorus using tight binding approximation and Green's function approach. Moreover, by using density functional theory (DFT), we show that the applied strain in the x,y axes and electric field can be used to tune the electronic properties of black phosphorene. We also provide a comparison of phonon vibrational modes of planar and puckered phosphorene to compare their structure stability. It was found that by structural deformation such as modifying the angle between two nearest neighboring P-P bond from two sublayers, consequently having a planar and a most puckered structure, no change can be seen for the effective masses along the y (zigzag) direction, but totally affected along the x (armchair) direction leading to heavier electrons and holes. Furthermore, 2D phosphorene exhibits different stiffness for applied strain in the x,y direction. Such rich variety of electronic, mechanical and structural transformations provide particular 2D phosphorene as a unique material for fundamental physics studies and applicable in nanoelectronic and nanophotonic devices.
266	Nanoindentation tests of heavy-ion-irradiated Au foams &ndash; molecular dynamics simulation	Irradiation by light ions may change the mechanical properties of nanofoams. Using molecular-<br />dynamics simulation, we study the effect of irradiating a Au foam (porosity 50 %, ligament diameter<br />3 nm) with heavy ions: here 10 keV Au ions up to a dose of 10 <sup>18</sup> m <sup>&minus;2</sup> . We demonstrate that in<br />consequence, ligament morphology changes in the irradiated region, caused by local melting. The<br />changes in mechanical properties are monitored by simulated nanoindentation tests. We find that<br />the foam hardness is only around 1/3 of the hardness of a bulk Au crystal. Irradiation increases the<br />hardness of the foam by around 10 % in the central irradiated area. The plastic zone extends to<br />only 1.5 a<sub> c</sub> , where a <sub>c</sub> denotes the contact radius; this value is unchanged under irradiation, while<br />dislocation activity after irradiation is more strongly localized under the indenter surface, indicating<br />that the irradiation-induced melting has stabilized the ligaments.
267	Numerical analysis of Ag-CuO/water rotating Hybrid nanofluid with heat generation/absorption	The present work is committed to examine the impacts of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), heat generation/absorption and volume fraction of nanoparticles on the flow of hybrid nanofluid past a stretching surface. The comparison of heat transfer properties of rotating, conventional nanofluid with that of developing Hybrid nanofluid is also studied. To examine the Lorentz force impacts on three dimensional stretching surface, another model of "thermophysical properties" is used. The whole system including nanofluid and stretching surface is in rigid body rotation about an axis normal to the plane of stretching surface with constant angular velocity. The system of governing nonlinear partial differential equations have been simplified by using suitable similarity transformations and then solved via an efficient numerical technique BVP-4C. The velocity and local skin friction are obtained in both directions. The rate of heat transfer is determined on the surface. The effects of pertinent physical parameters which are magnetic parameter, rotation parameter, stretching parameter, heat generation or absorption parameter and Prandtl number have been discussed through graphical and tabular form. From the present study, it is noticed that the rate of heat transfer of Hybrid nanofluid is higher than that of ordinary nanofluid. In "Hybrid nanofluid", the required rate of heat transfer can be accomplished by picking distinctive and suitable nanoparticle extents.
268	<strong>Influence of cobalt doping on residual stress in ZnO nanorods</strong>	Cobalt-doped (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods were deposited on silicon wafers by a chemical bath deposition technique. Variations in energy band gap and stress due to cobalt doping were analyzed by X-ray diffraction techniques, optical measurements and modeled by density functional theory calculations. In addition, the direct residual stress in ZnO nanorods was investigated by measuring the difference in curvature across the doped ZnO thin films deposited on a silicon substrate using the Bow Optic wafer stress measurement system. The stress in doped ZnO films was found to be of compressive in nature. &nbsp;The residual stress in doped ZnO thin films was found in the range of 0.0427 to 1.0174 GPa. The residual stress was also found to scale with the cobalt doping concentration in ZnO thin film. In addition, the crystalline structure of various cobalt doped ZnO nanorods films was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis to be of the wurtzite structure. The bandgap of cobalt-doped ZnO was red-shifted from 3.30 eV to 3.21 eV as the cobalt concentration in ZnO nanostructures varied from 0% to 20%. A linear relationship between stress and bandgap shifting in cobalt-doped ZnO nanorods was obtained based on x-ray diffraction and direct stress measurements.

270	Spin-relaxation anisotropy in a nanowire quantum dot with strong spin-orbit coupling	We study the impacts of the magnetic field direction on the &nbsp;spin dynamics in a one-dimensional quantum dot with strong spin-orbit coupling. The energy spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions in the quantum dot are obtained exactly. We find that no matter how large the spin-orbit coupling is, the electric-dipole spin transition rate as a function of the magnetic field direction always has a &pi; periodicity. However, the phonon-induced spin relaxation rate as a function of the magnetic field direction has a &pi; periodicity only in the weak spin-orbit coupling regime and a 2&pi;&nbsp;periodicity in the strong spin-orbit coupling regime.
271	<strong>Highly conductive two-dimensional electron gas at amorphous aluminium oxide heterostructures</strong>	We have created a two-dimensional electron gas at the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/SrTiO<sub>3</sub>/LaAlO<sub>3</sub> heterostructures using pulsed laser deposition at growth temperatures in the range of 400-600 &deg;C. The Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/SrTiO<sub>3</sub>/LaAlO<sub>3</sub> heterostructures exhibit a decreased sheet resistance with enhanced growth temperatures of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> films. The amorphous growth of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> films is demonstrated by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. Compared with these heterostructures with Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> films deposited on pristine SrTiO<sub>3</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub> terminated-SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/STO/LAO heterostructures are more conductive. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates the formation of oxygen vacancies at the STO side of the interface, which result from the redox reactions by reducing the STO films surface. Furthermore, the occurrence of oxygen vacancies on the STO side is verified by a blue-light emission. The fabrication of highly conductive interfaces of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/STO/LAO heterostructures probably enables the integration of an oxide nanoelectronic device and Si-based electronic circuits and opens new avenues for oxide nanoelectronics and mesoscopic physics.
272	Transient Joule Heating/Cooling based PrMnO<sub>3&nbsp;</sub>Oscillator Neuron for Oscillatory Neural Networks	Brain-like, time and energy efficient computational schemes are attracting widespread attention from all constitutional disciplines like devices, circuits and algorithms. Detailed studies into the neural time dynamics have revealed massively parallel computing architectures utilizing the complex spatio-temporal interaction between neurons. In particular, Oscillatory Neural Networks (ONN), based on the thalamo-cortical neural system, claim to use the phase relations of active oscillating units to solve NP-hard problems like pattern recognition, and vertex colouring &ndash; a key challenge for von-Neumann computing. Hardware realization of ONNs using analog CMOS based oscillators is area and power inefficient. The performance gets affected even more as the size of the network increases in line with real life applications. Thus, a nanoscale oscillator with low operating voltage is attractive to enable large ONNs. Recently, transient joule heating induced high nonlinearity in the current-voltage characteristics was shown in area scalable PrMnO<sub>3</sub> (PMO) based RRAM. In this work, transient joule heating based highly non-linear I-V and hysteresis loop, we propose an oscillator neuron using PMO device put in series with a resistor and a capacitor to produce self-sustained oscillations. The transient measurements suggest that the oscillation frequencies of ~ 1MHz can be achieved, beyond which the oscillations are limited by devices heating timescale. Finally, a behavioral model of the oscillator is developed in Verilog-A to explore the design space over which the device operates. Based on such experimentally calibrated circuit models, large network of oscillators can be designed and performance can be evaluated in solving intricate real-life applications.

274	<strong>Rapid fabrication of conductive silver line via plasma-enhanced inkjet printing</strong>	Atmospheric-pressure nonequilibrium plasma was applied to improve inkjet printing in terms of the line width, sintering temperature, and speed. Plasma irradiated silver-nanoparticle-dispersed inks during flight and after landing on a substrate to promote solidification and sintering. A silver line with electrical resistivity of 2.9&times;10<sup>-5</sup>&nbsp;&Omega;&nbsp;cm was fabricated on a polyimide for plasma exposure time of 1 s. During plasma irradiation, the substrate temperature was only reached to 120 &deg;C, avoiding any visible damage. Compared with heat treatment at 120 &deg;C, the silver line with plasma treatment shows lower electrical resistivity, a narrower line width, and a higher sintering speed.
275	Laser-controlled field effect in graphene/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures	The possibility of modification of the local properties of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) by laser irradiation is investigated. Investigations conducted using both Raman spectroscopy and electrostatic force microscopy were performed. Laser light induced modifications are found to cause no structural changes. However, they have impact on Raman spectra and local charge state of the material. They are also shown to be stable in time and during electrical grounding of the sample. The mechanism of photoionization of deep defects present in h-BN is proposed to explain the observed phenomenon. The discussed effect opens up new method of nanostructurization of h-BN based planar heterostructures.
276	<strong>Experimental and Theoretical Study of Ultraviolet-Induced Structural/Optical Instability In Nano Silicon-Based Photo Sensing</strong>	Nano silicon is emerging as an active element for UV applications due to quantum confinement-induced widening of the Si bandgap, amenability to integration on Si and less sensitivity to temperature. NanoSi-based UV applications include deep space exploration; high temperature propulsion; solar photovoltaics; and particle detection in high energy accelerators. However, the viability of the technology is limited by a complex nanoSi optical quenching instability. Here, we examined the time dynamics of UV-induced luminescence of sub 3-nm nanoSi. The results show that luminescence initially quenches, but it develops a stability at ~ 50% level with a time characteristic of minutes. Upon isolation, partial luminescence recovery/reversibility occurs with time characteristics of hours. To discern the origin of the instability, we perform first principle atomistic calculations of the molecular / electronic structure in 1-nm Si particles as a function of Si structural bond expansion, using time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), with structural relaxation applied in both ground and excited states. For certain bond expansion/relaxation, the results show that the low-lying triplet state dips below the singlet ground state, providing a plausible long-lasting optical trap that may account for luminescence quenching as well as bond cleavage and irreversibility. Time dynamics of device-operation that accommodates the quenching/recovery time dynamics is suggested as a means to alleviate the instability and allow control of recovery, which promises to make it an effective alternative to UV-enhanced Si or metal-based wide-bandgap sensing technology.
277	About the assignment of the EPR lines to Ce3+ in ceria powders	The electron paramagnetic resonance of Ce3+ ions in ceria is a rather controversial issue. In this report we analyze the EPR line with g ~ 1.97 in the absorption spectra of ceria powders, which has been assigned in many studies to Ce3+ ions. Such an assignment is not in agreement with the experimental data nor with the theory of spin-lattice relaxation of rare earth ions in solids. Our statement is supported by our experimental results based on EPR spectroscopy of nanocrystalline ceria, synthesized in various ways, as well as by magnetization measurements of as-prepared and vacuum-annealed ceria nanoparticles. The possible model of the paramagnetic center, which is assigned to the EPR line with g ~ 1.97 in ceria, is an electron trapped near the surface Ce3+/Ce4+ redox pair.
278	Microfluidic Standing Air Bubbles (&#x03BC;SABs)	Bubbles are commonly observed in microfluidic systems, yet they are often categorized as unfavorable elements if not under control. Although previous scientific endeavors have proven that the restrained micro-scale gas-liquid interfaces could be useful for various purposes, there is still plenty of room for further development of functional bubble-based microfluidics. Here, this report introduces a highly stable, controllable and scalable micro-bubble formation and manipulation method, named as Microfluidic Standing Air Bubbles (&#x03BC;SABs). The &#x03BC;SAB arrays are easily originated in specially-designed crevice structures on microfluidic channel walls in a repeatable and scalable manner. The size and geometry of &#x03BC;SABs are tuned by varying air mass transfer through a selectively permeable barrier where the bubbles attaching to. Both numerical calculations and experiments are implemented to explain the multiphysical coupling principles behind the phenomena, and to prove the controllable &#x03BC;SAB variation. A good linearity between &#x03BC;SABs volumetric variation rate and control pressure is validated under normal handling conditions (control pressure: -70kPa to 90kPa, average flow velocity: 0 to 7.4mm/s). Furthermore, the controllability, stability and potential practical applications are experimentally demonstrated. The &#x03BC;SABs own stable, controllable, scalable and flexible liquid-gas interfaces, making them an innovative technology and a promising candidate for accurate micro-manipulation, precise micro-/nano- flow regulation, high-throughput liquid-gas chemical synthesis, innovative biochemical and biophysical assays.
279	Extending the dynamic range of microchannel plate detectors using charge-integration-based counting	Abstract. Microchannel plate (MCP) detectors provide a mechanism to produce a measureable current pulse (~0.1mA over several nanoseconds) when stimulated by a single incident particle or photon. Reductions of the device's amplification factor (i.e., gain) due to high incident particle flux can lead to significant degradation of detection system performance. Here we develop a parameterized model for the variation of MCP gain with incident flux. This model provides a framework with which to quantify the limits of high-flux MCP operation. We then compare the predictions of this model to laboratory measurements of an MCP's response to a pulsed charged particle beam. Finally, we demonstrate that through integration of the MCP output current in pulsed operation, effective count rates up to ~ 1 GHz can be achieved, more than an order of magnitude increase over conventional counting techniques used for spaceflight applications.
280	<strong>Signatures of two dimensional transport in superconducting nanocrystalline boron-doped diamond films</strong>	The possibility of a two dimensional (2D) phase is investigated in superconducting boron-doped nanocrystalline diamond films.&nbsp; The fluctuation spectroscopy schemes such as the Azlamazov-Larkin (AL) and Lerner-Varlamov-Vinokur (LVV) are used to determine the dimensionality crossovers occurring near the superconducting phase transition.&nbsp; It is found that a distinct 2D phase in the fluctuation regime occurs.&nbsp; One of the consequences of the 2D transport is the manifestation of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition which is verified through both current voltage power law scaling as well as the Halperin-Nelson fitting to the temperature dependent resistance.&nbsp; The suppression of the BKT transition with applied field is found to be correlated with the decrease of Josephson coupling between grains.&nbsp; The identification of a 2D phase accompanied by the BKT transition implies the presence of a topological order, highlighting the potential for diamond based quantum information technology.
281	Characterization of BaTiO<sub>3</sub> nanocubes assembled into highly-ordered monolayers using micro- and nano-Raman spectroscopy	We investigated the influence of heat treatment on the crystallographic structure and ferroelectric phase transition behavior of barium titanate (BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, BT) nanocubes assembled into highly-ordered monolayers, using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), temperature-dependent micro-Raman spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). TER spectra from individual BT nanocubes with the size of about 20 nm were successfully obtained with a side-illumination optical setup, and revealed that heat treatment enhances their tetragonality. The result of temperature-dependent micro-Raman spectroscopy showed that the ferroelectric phase transition behavior of the monolayers becomes similar to that of bulk BT through heat treatment in spite of their thickness. STEM observation for the cross-section of the heated BT nanocube monolayer showed that amorphous layers exist at the interface between BT nanocubes in face-to-face contact. These results indicate that the tetragonal crystal structure of BT nanocubes is stabilized by heat treatment and the formation of the interfacial amorphous layer during heat treatment may be a key to this phenomenon.
282	<strong>Effect of Lorentz forces on nanofluid flow and heat transfer during solidification process in a porous energy storage system </strong>	In this paper, influence of Lorentz forces on flow and heat transfer of NEPCM during solidification process is presented numerically using finite element method. Poor thermal conductivity of phase change material is a limitation of thermal storage systems. To overcome this problem, NEPCM can be utilized instead of pure PCM. Water and CuO are utilized as PCM and nanoparticles, respectively. Brownian motion impact is considered to predict nanofluid properties. Results are shown as solid fraction, isotherm and stream line contours. Results prove that solidification rate enhances with rise of Lorentz forces. As Hartmann number augments, total energy increases and solid fraction curve will converge in lower time.
283	<span style="color: #000000;">Onset of lasing in small devices: the identification of the first threshold</span>	We present a simple and &#xFB02;exible technique for identifying the onset of coherent emission in lasers, from the meso- to the nano-scale, which makes use of photon counting and a small amplitude modulation added to the pump. The optimal modulation frequency is obtained from the radiofrequency power spectrum of the unperturbed laser emission. The identi&#xFB01;cation of the lasing onset rests on the appearance of a resonance in the response of the zero-order autocorrelation function (g<sup>(2)</sup> (0)) plotted as a function of the pump rate. The intrinsic simplicity of this technique and its use of photon counting make it an excellent tool for certifying the onset of laser emission in nanoscale sources. <span style="color: #000000;"></span>
284	<strong>Spontaneous nanostructure formation in GaAsBi alloys</strong>	Bismuth containing semiconductor alloys are of increasing interest for their potential applications as infrared devices, though material quality in these materials has often proven problematic.&nbsp; This work shows a series of GaAsBi films grown by molecular beam epitaxy over a range of temperatures, 340C-315C, with all other parameters equal.&nbsp; Atomic force microscopy shows that there is an increase in the surface roughness of the films from 0.8nm to 2.7nm RMS. Transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography reveals the onset of spontaneous nanostructure formation in the films including nanopores, lateral composition modulation, and Bi rich GaAsBi clusters.&nbsp; The phenomena are shown to correlate and linked to reaching a growth instability due to the differences in surface diffusivity of Bi and As adatoms.
285	Shock Wave Plasma Induced Emission Generated by Low Energy Nanosecond Nd:YAG Laser in Open Air and Its Application to Quantitative Cr Analysis of Low Alloy Steel	We report the result of an experimental study that shows the remarkable benefits of generating a micro shock wave plasma by low energy (800 &#x00B5;J) nanosecond (ns) Nd:YAG laser irradiation on a solid target in open air and the efficient detection of the induced plasma emission. The very low irradiation power density of 0.8 MW/cm2 gives the important benefits of minimizing surface damage on the sample surface and reducing the ion production responsible for the undesirable emission background as well as the Stark broadening effect, and thus leading to largely improved spectral quality. This is corroborated by the result of spectra measured from a number of metal samples which display the sharp emission lines with low background. Specifically, its application to Cr analysis of a series of low alloy steel samples with different Cr concentrations is shown to yield a linear calibration curve with an extrapolated zero intercept and an estimated detection limit of about 10 ppm.
286	A Novel Pore-Free Strategy via Interfacial Effects in Nanocomposites to Produce Polyethylene with Ultra-Low Dielectric Constants	Materials with an ultra-low dielectric constant (&epsilon;) have been the topic of much interest because they are widely used in integrated circuits and high frequency devices. Pores (&epsilon; = 1) have been generally introduced in materials to reduce their &epsilon; to below 2. In this work, an alternative but highly facile method is introduced to create ultra-low &epsilon; materials based on interfacial effects in nanocomposites. Typical nanocomposites, polyethylene/silica nanoparticle composites, were prepared by mechanical blending and hot-pressing. The composite&rsquo;s &epsilon; was dramatically decreased from 2.50 to 1.90 when incorporating 8 wt.% silica. This &epsilon; value was much lower than the low extreme of predicted &epsilon;. The porosities of the composites are below 1 %, indicating that the ultra-low &epsilon; is not a result of a porous structure. Instead, this ultra-low &epsilon; was found to be correlated with dielectric confinement effect of silica nanoparticles caused by interfacial effect. The interfacial effect was evidenced by the change of &epsilon; with loading ratios of silica and pressures, and a nanoparticle-induced crystallization.
287	SiO<sub>2</sub> etch characteristics and environmental impact of Ar/C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub>O chemistry	For the nano-scale etching in the semiconductor process, perfluorocarbon (PFC) gases are commonly used. However, PFCs mainly used in semiconductor processing have disadvantages such as high life time and global warming effect when released into the air. Therefore, in this research, SiO<sub>2</sub> etch characteristics and global warming effects of C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub>O gas chemistry with low global warming potential were compared with those of C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub> chemistry which is one of the gases mainly used in the semiconductor process. With Ar/C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub>O, the SiO<sub>2</sub> rates were higher while the etch selectivities of SiO<sub>2</sub> over amorphous carbon layer (ACL) as the hardmask layer were lower compared to those with Ar/C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> when other etch conditions were maintained same. Ar/C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub>O also showed more anisotropic SiO<sub>2</sub> etch profiles by suppressing the bowing, narrowing, and necking effects compared to Ar/C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>. When the global warming effects were evaluated by calculating the million metric ton carbon equivalents (MMTCEs) from the volumetric concentrations of emitted by-product species and process gases, the results showed that, at the optimized conditions, Ar/C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub>O exhibited a lower environmental impact by showing < 24% MMTCE value compared to that of Ar/C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, it is believed that Ar/C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub>O could be considered as a new potential replacement gas mixture for Ar/C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> because of the lower MMTCE and the acceptable etch characteristics of SiO<sub>2</sub>.
288	Enhanced ferromagnetism in mechanically-exfoliated CVD-carbon films prepared by using adamantane as precursor	In this work, room-temperature ferromagnetism which is not caused by conventional magnetic elements (e.g. Fe, Co, and Ni) is observed in carbon films prepared by using adamantane (C10H16): the smallest member of the so called diamondoid series (nano-diamond structures). These chemical-vapor-deposition (CVD) films exhibit a moderately strong ferromagnetism which can be further enhanced by mechanically exfoliating the top layers of the films off; the saturated magnetization can be as large as 3.95 emu/cm3 at room temperature. Magnetic force microscopy measurement shows a clear contrast in magnetization between original and exfoliated regions, indicating that the magnetic origin likely comes from the broken &rdquo;dangling&rdquo; bonds at the exfoliated surface. This work suggests an inexpensive method for creating carbon films whose magnetization can be activated from mechanical exfoliation.
289	Ferro and Anti-ferromagnetic Coupling in Pr, Dy, and Tb Substituted Nd-Fe-B nanoparticles and Its Effect on Magnetic Properties	Magnetic nanoparticles of Nd13.5RE4.5Fe77.5B7.5 (RE = Pr, Dy, and Tb) were prepared by co-precipitation followed by reduction diffusion. After substitution, Pr was ferromagnetic but Dy and Tb were anti-ferromagnetic to Nd and Fe in the Nd-Fe-B crystal lattice. The magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy was increased from 0.2284 MJ/m3 to 0.3924 and 0.3910 MJ/m3 after the substitution of Nd with Dy and Tb in Nd-Fe-B. The main reason for the improvement of the magnetic properties was the enhancement of the magneto-crystalline anisotropy of the crystal lattice by the pinning of magnetic moments and increase of the thickness of the magnetic domain wall.
290	<strong>Bonding and de-bonding of SiC-SiC via an intermediate Ni nano-film</strong>	In this study, a wafer bonding and de-bonding method for silicon carbide (SiC) that can sustain rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at ~1273 K has been realized for the first time. Two SiC wafers were bonded via an intermediate nickel (Ni) nano-film at room temperature without any pressure, which was characterized as a seamless and robust bonding. After the RTA process, the strength of the bonding interface was dramatically decreased and the de-bonding could happen at the interface during pulling test. Both of the mechanisms of bonding and de-bonding have been investigated through interface analyses. The sufficient atomic diffusion between two deposited Ni nano-films together with the interfacial mixing between amorphous SiC and the Ni nano-film contribute to the strong bonding of SiC-SiC. The interfacial precipitation of layered carbon material parallel to the SiC substrates is assumed to be the reason of the interface weakening and successful de-bonding after annealing. It is believed that the further development of this bonding and de-bonding technology will advance thin SiC device fabrication, where the RTA process at ~1273 K is widely used.
291	Novel concept for collective surface plasmon excitation and amplification through the dissipative instability of direct current in a two-dimensional quantum well	We propose an original concept for on-chip excitation and amplification of surface plasmon polaritons. Our approach, named nanoresotron, utilizes the collective effect of dissipative instability of a direct current flowing in a two-dimensional quantum well coupled to a metal surface. The instability arises through the excitation of self-consistent&nbsp; plasma oscillations and results in the creation of a pair of collective surface electromagnetic modes in addition to conventional plasmon resonances. We derive the dispersion equations for these modes using self-consistent solutions of Maxwell's and 2D hydrodynamics equations. We find that the phase velocities of these new collective modes are close to the drift velocity of 2D electrons. We demonstrate that the slow mode is amplified while the fast mode exhibits absorption. Estimates indicate that very high gain are attainable, which makes the nanoresotron a promising scheme to electrically excite and regenerate surface plasmon polaritons.
292	Effect of MWCNT-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Water Hybrid Nanofluid on the Thermal Performance of Ribbed Channel with Apart Sections of Heating and Cooling	A Two-dimensional (2D) numerical simulation is performed to simulate the laminar forced convection of a nanofluid in a ribbed channel with apart heating (cooling) sources using lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The multi-wall carbon nanotubes-iron oxide nanoparticles/water hybrid nanofluid (MWCNT-Fe3O4/water hybrid nanofluid) is used in this simulation. &nbsp;The velocity field, temperature distribution and heat transfer rate are numerically analyzed with the streamlines and isotherm patterns by means of a house-code. Also, the effect of Reynolds number (Re=25, 50, 75 and 100), nanoparticle solid volume fraction (&#x03D5;=0, 0.001, 0.003) and ratio of the blocks height (A=0.2, 0.3, 0.4) are measured in this paper. The computational method is validated against the results reported in the literature and a good agreement is reported. The obtained results show a maximum value of 16.49% increase in average heat transfer coefficient for all the considered cases relative to the base fluid. Moreover, the local Nusselt number proves that the use of blocks on the channel walls can increase the amount of heat transfer. Finally, average Nusselt number shows a linear dependence on the increasing ratio of&nbsp; blocks height for constant solid volume fraction. The results of this study are applicable to the industrial equipment heating and cooling applications.
293	Numerical Investigation of Nanofluids Heat Transfer in a Channel Consists of Rectangular Cavities by Lattice Boltzmann Method	In this study, Lattice Boltzmann simulation is performed to investigate laminar forced convection of nanofluids&nbsp;in a horizontal parallel-plate channel with three rectangular cavities. Two cavities are considered as located&nbsp;on the top wall of the channel and one on the bottom wall. The effects of the Reynolds number (100-400), the&nbsp;cavity aspect ratio (AR=0.25, 0.5), the various distances of the cavities from each other (X&prime;<sub>c</sub>) at different solid&nbsp;volume fractions of nanofluids (&#x03D5; = 0-0.05) on the velocity, and the temperature profiles of the nanofluids&nbsp;are studied. In addition, the flow patterns, i.e., the deflection and re-circulation zone inside the cavities, and&nbsp;the local and averaged Nusselt numbers on the channel walls are calculated. The results obtained are used&nbsp;to ascertain the validity of the written numerical code, which points to the excellent agreement across the&nbsp;results. The results show that, as the solid volume fraction of nano fluids is enhanced, the transfer of heat&nbsp;to working fluids increases significantly. Further, the results show that the maximum value of the averaged&nbsp;Nusselt number in the channel is obtained at X&prime;c=0.1204 for AR = 0.5 and X&prime;<sub></sub><sub>c</sub>=0.1024 for AR = 0.25. The&nbsp;interval [0.1224, 0.1304] is the best position for the second cavity. It is concluded that the results of this&nbsp;paper are very useful for designing optimized heat exchangers.
294	<strong>ZnO nanorod array/reduced graphene oxide substrate with enhanced performance in photocatalytic degradation</strong>	A novel ZnO nanorod array/reduced graphene oxide (ZnO array/rGO) composite coating was synthesized via the combination of seed layers-growth and aqueous solution reaction for the formation of ZnO nanorod array and further simple water bath method to compound rGO. The results revealed that perpendicular arrays with hexagonal planes were successfully fabricated. The size and density of the arrays can be adjusted by the concentration of the reactants. The influence of the rGO additive concentration on the photocatalytic degradation of the ZnO array/rGO composites under UV radiation were investigated. It was found that the photocatalytic performance could be obviously improved after coupling rGO for MB decomposition. The enhanced photocatalytic activities could be attributed to the interactions between ZnO nanorod arrays and rGO nanosheets and subsequently effective separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs via rGO as electron sinks. The ZnO array/rGO composites are expected to the ideal photocatalysts for the future utilization to take facile and green preparation, increasing the photo-electron lifetime, improving particle agglomeration and being prone to recovery into account.
295	<strong>Tutorial: Determination of Thermal Boundary Resistance by Molecular Dynamics Simulations</strong>	Due to the high surface&ndash;to&ndash;volume ratio of nanostructured components in microelectronics and other advanced devices, the thermal resistance at material interfaces can strongly affect the overall thermal behavior in these devices. Therefore, the thermal boundary resistance, <em>R</em>, must be taken into account in the thermal analysis of nanoscale structures and devices. This article is a tutorial on the determination of <em>R</em> and the analysis of interfacial thermal transport via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In addition to reviewing the commonly-used equilibrium and non-equilibrium MD models for the determination of <em>R</em>, we also discuss several MD simulation methods which can be used to understand interfacial thermal transport behavior. To illustrate how these MD models work for various interfaces, we will show several examples of MD simulation results on thermal transport across solid-solid, solid-liquid, and solid-gas interfaces. The advantages and drawbacks of a few other MD models such as approach-to-equilibrium MD and first-principle MD are also discussed.
296	Synthesis and enhanced third-order nonlinear optical effect of ZnSe/graphene composites	ZnSe/graphene composites can be produced by the amount of hydrazine hydrate, and their nonlinear optical properties are investigated at 532 nm by a picosecond laser Z-scan technique. The attachment of the ZnSe nanocrystals on graphene nanosheets can be confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray and UV-Vis spectroscopy. And the interaction between them enhances the optical nonlinearity of ZnSe/graphene composites than single ZnSe or graphene. The increase of ZnSe size further enhances the optical nonlinearity of ZnSe/graphene.
297	Diffusion behavior of water confined in deformed carbon nanotubes	We use molecular dynamics simulations to study the diffusion of water inside deformed carbon nanotubes, with different degrees of eccentricity at 300K. We found a water structural transition between tubular-like to single-file for the (7,7) nanotubes associated with a change from a high to low mobility regimes. The water which in the undeformed (9,9) nanotubes is frozen, becomes liquid for the distortion above a certain threshold. These water diffusion enhancement (suppresion) is related to a reduction (increase) in the number of hydrogen bonds. This suggests that the shape of the nanotube is a particularly important ingredient when considering the dynamical and structural properties of confined water.
298	THE ISING MODEL OF CONFINED WATER IN CNT	The Ising model, describing mathematically phase transitions between disordered and ordered states in ferromagnets and binary alloys, has been applied to the freezing process of water confined inside the carbon nanotube. To take into account the rearrangement of water molecules inside the carbon nanotube to retain their hydrogen bonds in competition with van der Waals interactions with carbon atoms of the nanotube, an additional term has been introduced into the formula for the ordering parameter in water. Inclusion of this hydrophobic effect which  depends exponentially upon the diameter of the tube within the Ising model yields an expression for the dependence of freezing temperature of water inside the CNT upon its diameter. According to the model, the smaller the diameter of the tube, the higher freezing temperature of water molecules.  These theoretical results are in a good agreement with the experimental data.
299	<strong>Conductivity of disordered nanowire networks: the dependence on length ratio of conducting paths to whole nanowires</strong>	Conducting behavior of disordered nanowire networks is found to be determined by the length ratio of conducting paths to whole nanowires in the networks, which has been concluded from combined studies of simulation and experiment. An algorithm is designated for the simulation, where evolution dynamics of conducting paths and network conductance could be monitored at the same time. It is observed that, with increment of nanowire length (at given area fraction), conducting paths grow more slowly than the percolated clusters, but they play a key role in the conductivity. Normalized network conductivity of the disordered nanowire network is found to function linearly with the length-ratio of conducting paths to the whole nanowires. The relationship has been verified by experiments where networks are built up from random aligned silver nanowires. In addition, the newly proposed relationship could be used to anticipate theoretical conductivity of given disordered nanowire network, as well as the average junction resistance between nanowires. The relationship happens to be very similar to the Effective Medium Theory proposed by Kirkpatrick (1973) in treating 2D bond percolation, but the deterministic parameter shall be changed from filling probability of bonds to length ratio of the conducting paths. The difference lies on that the length ratio concerns only on conducting paths, rather than dead ends or branches. At last, the length ratio functioned relationship could be treated as a basic tool to describe the conducting behavior of disordered nanowire networks.
300	Local strain distribution and microstructure of grinding- induced damage layers in SiC wafer	The high angular resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) technique was utilized in evaluating the elastic strain distribution of grinding-induced damage layers in SiC wafer. Through HR-EBSD analysis, along with TEM observation, it was revealed that the damage layers formed beneath the wafer surface when the surface was ground by diamond abrasives; and the layers were classified hierarchically based on the distribution of elastic strain and lattice defects. In particular, very large elastic strain formed in a defective region of roughly 0.6 &micro;m in thickness, just beneath the ground wafer surface, where lattice defects such as dislocations, stacking faults, and microcracks were introduced inhomogeneously by abrasive interaction and the related plastic deformation and fracture. Based on this inhomogeneity, the defective region was itself classified into two types: one, a highly defective region with very large, complicated strain and high defect density; and the other, a basal plane dislocation (BPD)-glide region, with small strain and few BPDs or stacking faults. Beneath the defective region, a strain gradient region of roughly 1.8 &micro;m in thickness, which was unambiguously identified by HR-EBSD strain analysis alone, revealed a monotonic gradient in the dominant compressive strain component, with no grinding-induced defects. Overall, HR-EBSD analysis revealed a nanometer-scale, hierarchical elastic strain distribution in the grinding-induced damage layers.
301	A NOMS Switch Operating at Low-light-Level	This paper reports an all-optical switch working at low-light-level based on nano-opto-mechanics system (NOMS) technology. This NOMS switch consists of a silicon micro-ring resonator with a suspended arc and a bus waveguide with a footprint size of 50 &micro;m &times; 50 &micro;m. In this device, a &ldquo;weak&rdquo; light beam controls the ON state and OFF state of a &ldquo;strong&rdquo; light beam through nonlinear enhanced optical gradient force. In our experiment, we have successfully demonstrated the repeated switching of ON &amp; OFF states with the control light (&ldquo;weak&rdquo; light) of intensity 380 times lower than that of the probe light (&ldquo;strong&rdquo; light). This new NOMS switch has potential applications in optical memories, quantum information networks, and on-chip optical signal process where the devices or the systems require high power efficiency, high cost-effective and ultra-compact integration.
302	Re doping induced 2H-1T phase transformation and ferromagnetism in MoS2 nanosheets	In this paper, Re doped MoS2 nanosheets were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal reaction and annealing process. Through structural characterization, it was observed that the doping of Re can lead to the 2H-1T transformation in both Re and Mo coordinating structure, and the 1T ratio increased with the Re doping concentration and maximally reached to 51.7 at.% and 85.1 at.% for Mo and Re, respectively. Besides, hysteresis loops demonstrated the intrinsic room temperature ferromagnetism in Re doped MoS2 nanosheets, and the values of saturated magnetization achieved to 9 memu/g when the doping concentration of Re is 17.12 at.%. The magnetic properties were mainly resulted from the increasing net magnetic moments of Re atoms and 1T-coordinated Mo atoms. Additionally, the 1T incorporated 2H structure and magnetism were thermal stable in these samples. These results explored a new path for MoS2 nanosheets to be applied in spintronic devices in the future.
303	<strong>Optical gain and excitonic processes in micrometer-sized ZnO particles</strong>	We investigate the emission properties of various ZnO microstructures with different size and shape in the temperature region from 3 to 300 K using a nanosecond pulsed laser as an excitation source. Room temperature stimulated emission is observed only from the sphere-like ZnO particles with size of a few micrometers. Temperature dependent measurements reveal that the mechanism of optical gain at temperatures below ~150 K is the exciton-exciton scattering, whereas at temperatures from ~150 K to room temperature the gain results solely from the exciton-electron scattering without any contribution from electron-hole plasma lasing. The observed temperature-induced transition between exciton-exciton and exciton-electron scattering is quite similar to the one reported recently for the micrometer-thick ZnO film [R. Matsuzaki <em>et al. </em>Phys. Rev. B 96, 125306 (2017).]. Thus, a purely excitonic stimulated emission is common in micrometer-sized ZnO crystals with appropriate optical feedback.
304	<strong>Seesaw-like</strong><strong> polarized transmission </strong><strong>behavior of</strong> <strong>s</strong><strong>ilver nanowire arrays </strong><strong>aligned by off-center spin-coating</strong>	Straight silver nanowires are synthesized by accelerated oxidization, and aligned into ordered arrays by off-center spin-coating. A seesaw-like behavior is revealed in the polarized transmission spectra the arrays. As polarization angle (<em>&theta;<sub>P</sub></em>, defined as the angle between axis of nanowires and direction of electric field of light) increases, transmission changes in two opposite directions in the two regions separated by a supporting point lying at 494 nm, besides that, they all evolve repeatedly with period of 180<sup>o</sup>. The behavior is different from those reported before, where transmission moves on the same direction. The behavior is ascribed to the Surface Plasma Polaritons (SPPs) determined extinction. Competition appears between the two modes of SPPs in determining the extinction of nanowires, as the mode along nanowire axis is mainly excited by long wavelengths, the other mode perpendicular to that depends mainly on short wavelengths, which then produces the seesaw-like behavior. Simulation is performed using on finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method, which reproduces the polarized transmission behavior. Moreover, it helps to reveal the effect of nanowire diameter on the supporting point in the seesaw-like transmission behavior.
305	<strong>Spin-orbit interaction in Pt or Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> nanoparticle-decorated graphene realized by nanoneedle method</strong>	<strong>The introduction of spin-orbit interactions (SOIs) and the subsequent appearance of a two-dimensional (2D) topological phase are crucial for voltage-controlled</strong><strong> spintronic devices. In contrast, graphene basically lacks SOIs due to the small mass of the carbon atom, and appropriate experimental reports for SOIs are rare. Here, </strong><strong>we precisely control small-amount (cover ratios &lt; 8 %) and damageless random-decoration of heavy nanoparticles </strong><strong>[platinum (Pt) or bismuth telluride (Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>)]</strong><strong> to </strong><strong>mono-layer </strong><strong>graphene by developing an original nanoneedle method. </strong><strong>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy</strong><strong> spectra suggest damageless decoration of the nanoparticles, resulting in emergence of the Bi-C and Te-C coupling orbitals.</strong> <strong>In the samples, we find </strong><strong>the emergence of particle-density dependent non-local resistance (R<sub>NL</sub>) peaks, which are attributed to the (inverse) spin Hall effect (SHE) arising from spin-orbit interaction (SOI) with energies as large as </strong><strong>~</strong><strong>50 meV that is the largest value among previous reports and supported by scanning tunnel microscopy spectra. The present observation opens doors to novel physics for topological phases of graphene, introducible by random heavy-nanoparticle decoration with controlled small-amount, and those applications.</strong>
306	<strong>Topological states mediated transport behavior in pnictogen chalcogenide nanocomposites</strong>	Bismuth telluride and selenide are well known 3-D topological materials with gapless surface states. We utilized the surface states to improve charge carrier transport across the hetero-phase boundary in composite samples. The pure and composite samples showed high temperature charge carrier transport influenced by acoustic phonon scattering. However, the electrical conductivity of composite samples was up to three times higher than the pure samples. The enhancement was attributed to topological states at the interface of two phases. The composite samples showed some improvement in thermoelectric and thermal transport behavior which resulted in better power factor and figure of merit as compared to pure samples.
307	<strong>Poly-crystalline silicon-oxide films as carrier-selective passivating contacts for c-Si solar cells</strong>	The poly-Si carrier-selective passivating contacts (CSPC) parasitically absorb a substantial amount of light, especially in the form of free carrier absorption. To minimize these losses, we developed CSPCs based on oxygen-alloyed poly-Si (poly-SiO<sub>x</sub>) and deployed them in c-Si solar cells. TEM analysis indicates the presence of nanometer-scale silicon crystals within such poly-SiO<sub>x</sub> layers. By varying the O content during material deposition, we can manipulate the crystallinity of poly-SiO<sub>x</sub> material and its absorption coefficient. Also depending on O content, the band gap of poly-SiO<sub>x</sub> material can be widened, making it transparent for longer wavelength light. Thus, we optimized the O alloying, doping, annealing and hydrogenation conditions. As a result, an extremely high passivation quality for both n-type poly-SiO<sub>x</sub> (J<sub>0</sub> = 3.0 fA/cm<sup>2</sup>, iVoc = 740 mV) and p-type poly-SiO<sub>x</sub> (J<sub>0</sub> = 17.0 fA/cm<sup>2</sup>, iVoc = 700 mV) is obtained. A fill factor of 83.5% is measured in front/back-contacted solar cell with both polarities made up of poly-SiO<sub>x</sub>. This indicates that the carrier transport through the junction between poly-SiO<sub>x</sub> and c-Si is sufficiently efficient. To demonstrate the merit of poly-SiOx layers&rsquo; high transparency at long wavelengths, they are deployed at the back side of interdigitated back-contacted (IBC) solar cells. A preliminary cell efficiency of 19.7% is obtained with much room for further improvement. Compared to an IBC solar cell with poly-Si CSPCs, a higher internal quantum efficiency at long wavelengths is observed for the IBC solar cell with poly-SiO<sub>x</sub> CSPCs, thus demonstrating the potential of poly-SiO<sub>x</sub> in enabling higher J<sub>SC</sub>.
308	<strong>Thermo-physical trends in time dependent Williamson model around a wedge </strong>	The addition of nano-sized particles into base fluid yields better heat transfer characteristics than that of base fluid without nano-scale particles. Such improvement in thermal conductivity brings attention of researchers and scientists in this direction. This paper provides nano-sized particles individualities subject to Williamson fluid model. The time dependent stagnation point magnetohydrodynamic fluid flow regime for the Williamson model is carried around a wedge surface. The nano-sized particles are suspended in the Williamson fluid flow regime along with pertinent physical effects, namely melting heat transfer, heat generation/absorption and new mass flux condition. The mathematical; formulation yields the system of partial differential equations through acceptable governing laws. The obtain system is enough hard to solve analytically due to non-linear in nature. Therefore, a self-coded algorithm is executed to report numerical solution. A both tabular and graphical trends are used to present the impact of involved physical parameters on Williamson velocity, temperature and concentration fields. In addition, the physical quantity at the surface of the wedge is also examined.
309	Space-charge and current non-uniformities, and contact resistivity of end-bonded metal contacts to thin heavily doped semiconductor nanowires	We report room temperature simulations of the effects of surrounding field and surface defects on small-bias space-charge and current distributions of <em>end-bonded</em> metal contacts having a wide range of intrinsic barrier heights <em>&Phi;<sub>b0</sub></em> = 0.4 - 0.8 V on <em>thin</em> n-type silicon NanoWires (NWs) of radius <em>R</em> = 5 - 10 nm<sup> </sup>and <em>heavy</em> doping of <em>N<sub>d</sub></em> = 10<sup>18 </sup>- 10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>, embedded in SiO<sub>2</sub>. We have two findings. (i) Radial distributions of space-charge and current, which are almost uniform for <em>N<sub>d</sub></em> &lt; 10<sup>18</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>, become highly non-uniform for <em>N<sub>d</sub></em> &gt; 10<sup>18</sup> cm<sup>-3 </sup>violating the key assumption of a plane space-charge edge employed in literature to analytically model NW junctions; the non-uniformity peaks at <em>N<sub>d</sub></em> where bulk depletion width &asymp; 2.14<em>R</em>, for large metal size and small surface charge. (ii) At <em>&Phi;<sub>b0</sub></em> = 0.8 V, both generation-recombination and tunneling govern the NW contact resistivity, <em>&rho;<sub>cN</sub></em>, for <em>N<sub>d</sub></em> up to 3 - 5 x 10<sup>18</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>, so that <em>&rho;<sub>cN</sub></em> varies slowly or may even increase in this <em>N<sub>d</sub></em> range; however, generation-recombination falls rapidly as <em>&Phi;<sub>b0 </sub></em>is reduced or <em>N<sub>d</sub></em> is raised, so that <em>&rho;<sub>cN</sub></em> of contacts with <em>&Phi;<sub>b0</sub></em> = 0.8 V and <em>N<sub>d</sub></em> &gt; 5 x 10<sup>18</sup> cm<sup>-3 </sup>or <em>&Phi;<sub>b0</sub></em> &le; 0.6 V and any <em>N<sub>d</sub></em> is governed by tunneling alone and falls monotonically with <em>N<sub>d</sub></em>. Our insights and data regarding space-charge, current and <em>&rho;<sub>cN</sub></em> variations are useful in design, characterization and analytical modeling of NW devices. Our calculations include the effects of contact geometry, dielectric confinement, image force barrier lowering and heavy doping.
310	Conformational kinetic analysis of replica exchange MD: T-dependent Markov networks for FF amyloid peptides	Recent developments using Markovian descriptions of conformational states of biomolecular systems have led to powerful analysis frameworks for their complex dynamical behavior. In conjunction with enhanced sampling methods, such as replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), these frameworks allow the systematic and accurate extraction of transition probabilities between the corresponding states, in the case of Markov state models, and of statistically-optimized transition rates in the case of the corresponding coarse master equations. However, applying automatically such methods to large molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with explicit water molecules, remains limited both by the initial ability to identify good candidates for the underlying Markovian states, and by the necessity to do so using good collective variables as reaction coordinates that allow the correct counting of inter-state transitions at various lag times. Here, we show that, in cases when representative molecular conformations can be identified for the corresponding Markovian states, and thus their corresponding collective evolution of atomic positions can be calculated along MD trajectories, one can use them to build a new type of simple collective variable, that can be particularly useful in both the correct state assignment and in the subsequent accurate counting of inter-state transition probabilities. In the case of the ubiquitously used root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions, we introduce the relative RMSD measure (RelRMSD) as a good reaction coordinate candidate. We apply this method to the analysis of REMD trajectories of amyloid-forming diphenylalanine (FF) peptides - a system with important nanotechnology and biomedical applications due to its self-assembling and piezoelectric properties - illustrating the use of RelRMSD in extracting its temperature-dependent intrinsic kinetics, without a priory assumptions on the functional form (e.g., Arrhenius or not) of the underlying conformational transition rates. The RelRMSD analysis enables as well a more objective assessment of the convergence of the REMD simulations. This type of collective variable may be generalized to other observables that could capture accurately conformational differences between the underlying Markov states (e.g., dRMSD, T-RMSD, the fraction of native contacts, etc.).
311	<strong>Engineering few-layer MoTe<sub>2</sub> devices by Co/hBN tunnel contacts</strong>	2H phase Molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe<sub>2</sub>) is a layered two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor that has recently gained extensive attention for its intriguing properties, demonstrating great potential for nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. Optimizing the electric contacts to MoTe<sub>2</sub> is a critical step for realizing high performance devices. Here, we demonstrate the first Co/hBN tunnel contact to few-layer MoTe<sub>2</sub>. In sharp contrast to the p-type conduction of Co contacted MoTe<sub>2</sub>, Co/hBN tunnel contacted MoTe<sub>2</sub> devices show clear n-type transport property. Our first principle calculation reveals that the inserted few-layer hBN strongly interacts with Co and significantly reduces its work-function by ~1.2 eV, while MoTe<sub>2</sub> itself has much weaker influence on the work-function of Co. This allows us to build MoTe<sub>2</sub> diodes using the mixed Co/hBN and Co contacts architecture, which can be switched from p-n type to n-p type by changing the gate-voltage, paves the way for engineering multi-functional devices based on atomically thin 2D semiconductors.
312	<strong>Piezoelectric </strong><strong>performance enhancement</strong><strong> of Pb(Mg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>-0.25PbTiO<sub>3</sub> crystals by alternating current polarization for ultrasonic transducer</strong>	The [001]-oriented Pb(Mg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>-0.25PbTiO<sub>3</sub>(PMN-0.25PT) single crystal had been poled by using alternating current polarization (ACP). The piezoelectric, dielectric and electromechanical properties of PMN-0.25PT crystals were investigated as functions of polarization frequency, electric field and cycles. The optimal ACP condition for PMN-0.25PT crystals was obtained under an electric field of 12-18 kV/cm with polarization frequency of 20-40 Hz after 20 cycles. Compared to traditional direct current polarization (DCP), ACP makes the piezoelectric coefficient of PMN-0.25PT crystals increase by 40 %, from 1222 pC/N to 1724 pC/N. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) images of the crystals revealed that the periodic stripe nano-domains (non-180&deg; domains) with high domain wall density is the main contributors for piezoelectric enhancement. The results indicate that the alternating current poled PMN-0.25PT crystals with enhanced piezoelectric property will be promising candidate for sensors and transducers.
313	Directly Probing Light Absorption Enhancement of Single Hierarchical Structures with Engineered Surface Roughness	Hierarchical multiscale nanostructures are ideal architectures to harvest solar energy, in which absorption and propagation of light at the subwavelength scale are fundamental key issues. Exploring the light absorption in single hierarchical structures and determining key structural parameters can greatly help in enhancing multiscale optical phenomena and light management for modern photovoltaics, photoelectric and photoelectrochemical devices. However, due to the geometrical complexity of hierarchical architectures, numerical and experimental studies of light absorption have faced significant challenges. Given the light absorption is governed by the geometries of nanostructures, this study investigates the correlation between light absorption and surface roughness of single hierarchical structures by utilizing VO<sub>2</sub>-based near field powermeters. It is found that light trapping is significantly enhanced in rough microwires when the amplitude of roughness is comparable to the light wavelength while it rapidly reaches saturated values with trench depth larger than the light wavelength or trench spacing less than half of the light wavelength. These results are verified both on the fabricated VO<sub>2</sub> and Si hierarchical structures and thus provide a general rational design for modern hierarchical structures with enhanced behaviours.
314	Stray field signatures of N&eacute;el textured skyrmions in Ir/Fe/Co/Pt multilayer films	Skyrmions are nanoscale spin configurations with topological properties that hold great promise for spintronic devices. Here, we establish their N&eacute;el texture, helicity, and size in Ir/Fe/Co/Pt multilayer films by constructing a multipole expansion to model their stray field signatures and applying it to magnetic force microscopy (MFM) images. Furthermore, the demonstrated sensitivity to inhomogeneity in skyrmion properties, coupled with a unique capability to estimate the pinning force governing dynamics, portends broad applicability in the burgeoning field of topological spin textures.
315	Features of interferometry of small-sized plasma channels obtained during nanosecond breakdown	The applicability of the method of smooth perturbations for processing interferograms of small (5-200&#x00A0;&#x03BC;m) objects with taking into account the diffraction is investigated. The test problems showed the consistency of the method to the range of parameters interesting for us. The requirements for preliminary processing of experimental data are determined, adhering to which it is possible to improve the accuracy of the final results. The analysis of experimental interferograms in assuming of the cylindrical symmetry of the plasma object is carried out: the two-dimensional map of the electron density for the plasma object formed at initial stage of nanosecond breakdown was obtained from the phase map.
316	<strong>Molecular dynamics investigation on enhancement of heat transfer between electrified solid surface and liquid water</strong>	Interfacial nanolayer acting as a bridge linking a bulk solid phase and a bulk liquid phase has a crucial impact on the heat transfer from the solid to the liquid. In this work, we proposed a promising method to enhance the heat transfer between a Cu surface and liquid water by applying surface charges to the surface, which was expected to change the structure of the interfacial nanolayer. We employed molecular dynamics simulations to verify the effectiveness of the method. Our simulations showed that applying surface charges led to an orientational alignment of water molecules, reducing the spacing between the solid surface and the interfacial nanolayer and increasing the number of water molecules located at the interface nanolayer. Meanwhile, the presence of surface charges also improves the mismatch of vibrational density of states between solid atoms and water molecules. As a results, the heat transfer was enhanced as compared with that without surface charges and the enhancement becomes more remarkebly when applying more surface charges to the Cu surface.
317	<strong>Temperature-dependent radiative and non-radiative dynamics of photo-excited carriers </strong><strong>in extremely high-density and small InGaN nanodisks </strong><strong>fabricated by damage-free neutral-beam etching using bio-nano-templates</strong>	Temperature-dependent radiative and non-radiative dynamics of photoexcited carriers were studied in In<sub>0.3</sub>Ga<sub>0.7</sub>N nanodisks (NDs) fabricated from quantum wells (QWs) by damage-free neutral-beam etching using bio-nano-templates. The NDs had a diameter of 5 nm, thicknesses of 2 nm and 3 nm, and a sheet density of 2&times;10<sup>11 </sup>cm<sup>-</sup><sup>2</sup>. The radiative decay time, reflecting the displacement between the electron and hole wavefunctions, is about 0.1 ns; this value is almost constant as a function of temperature in the NDs and not dependent on their thickness. We observed non-exponential decay curves of photoluminescence (PL) in the NDs, particularly at temperatures above 150 K. The thermal activation energies of PL quenching in the NDs are revealed to be 95&ndash;110 meV, corresponding to the barrier heights of the valence bands in the disks. Therefore, hole escape is deemed responsible for the PL quenching, while thermal activation energies of 12&ndash;16 meV due to the trapping of carriers by defects were dominant in the mother QWs. The abovementioned non-exponential PL decay curves can be attributed to variations in the rate of hole escape in the NDs because of fluctuations in the valence-band barrier height, which, in turn, is possibly due to compositional fluctuations in the QWs. We found that non-radiative trapping, characteristic of the original QW, also exists in about 1% of the NDs in a form that is not masked by other newly formable defects. Therefore, we suggest that additional defects are not formed during our ND fabrication process.
318	Waxberry like nanosphere Li<sub>4</sub>Mn<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> as high performance electrode materials for supercapacitors	At present, studies on storage device, especial supercapacitors, mainly focus on the attained high performance electrode materials. The porous materials have the superior electrochemical performance owing to its porous structure which could increase the specific and contact area with the electrode. The spinel Li<sub>4</sub>Mn<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> has the three-dimensional tunnel structure for the better diffusion path, which have the advantage of lithium ion insertion and extraction in the framework. In this work, a waxberry like nanosphere and rasberry like nanosphere Li<sub>4</sub>Mn<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> have been fabricated by the wet chemistry and solid-state methods. The diameter of the single waxberry like sphere is about 1 &mu;m. &nbsp;The electrochemical performance of waxberry like nanosphere Li<sub>4</sub>Mn<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> was studied systemically. The specific capacitance of Li<sub>4</sub>Mn<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> was 535 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, the energy destiny was 110.7 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup>. Compared with rasberry like nanosphere Li<sub>4</sub>Mn<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, the waxberry like nanoporous spinel Li<sub>4</sub>Mn<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12 </sub>shows the better electrochemical performance and the stability, furthermore, these performance parameters have been improved as before reported. All these results indicate that the waxberry like nanoporous spinel Li<sub>4</sub>Mn<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> could provide the potential application in high performance supercapacitor.
319	New insight into printable europium doped yttrium borate luminescent pigment for security ink application	Counterfeiting has turned out to be a major area of concern these days and is becoming a serious problem worldwide. Modern technological advances have made counterfeiting of the sophisticated products easy. Therefore, it is need of an hour to search some new luminescent materials to overcome this problem.&nbsp; Herein, we report a highly luminescent YBO<sub>3</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup>nanophosphor was synthesized by Sol-gel technique, which can be easily scaled up in large quantity. This highly luminescent boron based optically active, structurally and chemically stable YBO<sub>3</sub>: Eu<sup>3+</sup>nanophosphor with average particle size in the range from 100 to 120 nm provides strong orange-red emission at 591 nm upon 245 nm excitation wavelength and also excitable in range of 280-480 nm excitation wavelengths. The structural/microstructural and photoluminescence behaviour were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy/high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and fluorescent spectroscopy, respectively. Further, this nanophosphor was used to design luminescent security ink with a commercially available polyvinyl chloride gold medium for printing of highly uniform security codes as investigated by PL mapping instruments.&nbsp; Thus, this facile method to synthesize a low-cost YBO<sub>3</sub>: Eu<sup>3+ </sup>nanophosphor based security ink offers a non-replicable security code for printing that can be easily printed but is difficult to counterfeit.
320	Effects of Electric Fields on Multiple Exciton Generation: An Ab Initio Study	Unique properties of lead chalcogenides have enabled multiple exciton generation (MEG) in their nanocrystals that can be beneficial in enhancing the efficiency of the third generation solar cells. Although the intrinsic electric field plays an imperative role in a solar cell, its effect on the multiple exciton generation (MEG) has been overlooked, so far. Using EOM-CCSD as a many-body approach, we show that any electric field can affect the absorptivity spectra of the lead chalcogenide nanocrystals (Pb<sub>4</sub>Te<sub>4</sub>, Pb<sub>4</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>, and Pb<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>). The same electric field, however, has insignificant effects on the MEG quantum probabilities and the thresholds in these nanocrystals. Furthermore, simulations show that Pb<sub>4</sub>Te<sub>4</sub>, among the aforementioned nanocrystals, has the lowest MEG threshold and the strongest absorptivity peak that is located in the multi-excitation window, irrespective of the field strength, making it the most suitable candidate for MEG applications. Simulations also demonstrate that an electric field affects the MEG characteristics in the Pb<sub>4</sub>Te<sub>4</sub> nanocrystal, in general, less than it perturbs MEG characteristics in Pb<sub>4</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> and Pb<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanocrystals. Our results can have a great impact in designing optoelectronic devices whose performance can be significantly influenced by MEG.
321	Practical aspects of line tensions	Two corrections to the intrinsic line tension by the curvature dependence of the liquid-vapor surface tension and by the contact angle dependence of the intrinsic line tension are qualitatively estimated.  First, we derive a generalized formula for the modified Young's equation with an apparent line tension from the thermodynamic free-energy minimization.  Next, the curvature dependence of the liquid-vapor surface tension is considered by using Tolman's formula.  Using the reported values of Tolman's length from the molecular dynamics simulations, the sign and the magnitude of the correction to the apparent line tension is semi-quantitatively estimated.  Then, the van der Waals line tension and its contact angle dependence for nanometer-scale droplet is considered.  The two corrections to the apparent van der Waals line tension are as small as nN, and leads to either a positive or a negative apparent line tension.   The gravitational line tension for millimeter-scale droplets is also considered by taking into account the gravitational potential.  The gravitational line tension is of the order of &#x03BC;N so that the correction from the curvature dependence of surface tension can be neglected.  Again, the contact angle dependence of the intrinsic line tension is so large that the apparent line tension becomes always negative even though the intrinsic line tension is always positive.
322	Flexible one-structure arched triboelectric nanogenerator based on common electrode for high efficiency energy harvesting and self-powered motion sensing	Triboelectric nanogenerators are widely concerned because of low cost, simple manufacturing process and high output performance. Here, we demonstrated a flexible one-structure arched triboelectric nanogenerator (FOAT) based on common electrode to combine the single-electrode mode and contact-separation mode by using silicone rubber, epoxy resin and flexible electrode. The peak-to-peak short circuit current of 18&#x00B5;A and the peak-to-peak open circuit voltage of 570V can be obtained from the FOAT with the size of 5*7 cm2 under the frequency of 3Hz and the pressure force of 300N. The peak-to-peak short circuit current of FOAT is increased by 29% and 80% and the peak-to-peak open circuit voltage is increased by 33% and 54% compared with single-electrode mode and contact-separation mode, respectively. FOAT realizes the combination of two generation modes, which improves the output performance of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). FOAT can completely light up 62 light-emitting-diodes (LEDs) and 2.2&#x00B5;F capacitor can be easily charged to 1.2V in 9s. When the FOAT is placed at different parts of the body, the human motion can be harvested and be the sensing signal for motion monitoring sensor. Based on the above characteristics, FOAT exhibits great potential in illumination, power supplies for wearable electronic devices and self-powered motion monitoring sensor by harvesting human motion energy.
323	DFT study of gold doped armchair graphene nanoribbons with vacancies	Systematic investigation of electronic, magnetic of vacancies-defected AGNRs and substitution by gold (Au) atoms are done in the framework of DFT. Remarkably, one vacancy- AGNR with a semiconductor behavior exhibits a high magnetic moment equal to 1.65 &#x03BC;B. Substitution of the missed carbon atom by Au one causes suggestive changes in the electronic spin and reduces magnetic moment to a value of 0.98 &#x03BC;B and still remains semiconductor. Divacancies (2V) and four vacancies (4V) AGNRs are nonmagnetics and semiconductors a with relatively large band gaps (0.40 and 0.62 eV). Substitutions with two and three gold atoms respectively leaves unchanged the behavior of the first structure and transform the last one to metallic like.
324	<strong>Ion Transport at Sub-Nanometer Interlayer Spacing in Thermally Modified Graphene Oxide Membranes</strong>	Graphene oxide (GO), an ionic and molecular sieve, is increasingly used to model ion transport channels in biological systems since its properties can be tuned by controlling the structure and dimensions of nano-capillaries between GO sheets. In the present work, ionic percolation at sub-nanometer interlayer spacing was examined for GO films in liquid phase intercalant, using electroimpedance spectroscopy, and response modelled using equivalent circuits. Interlayer spacing was tuned discretely by annealing GO at different temperatures. It was found that percolation resistance, <em>R<sub>P</sub></em>, decreases exponentially with interwall spacing. For GO annealed at T &ge; 180&deg;C, <em>R<sub>P</sub></em> exhibited an exponential decrease with time, suggesting a dynamic interwall spacing.&nbsp; It was demonstrated that <em>R<sub>P</sub></em> behaves similar to ion flux, reported by others. Further, these were found to have an empirical power law dependence. The present work allowed exploration of ion percolation at interlayer spacing down to 5.1 &Aring;, lower than those achieved experimentally so far.
325	Developing a coarse-grained DNA model with sequence specificity	DNA as one of the most significant biomacromolecules has shown great potentiality in many applications, e.g., used as novel materials in DNA origami technology, DNA molecular computing and genetic disease diagnostics. These applications are based on the competition of the nucleobase interactions of DNA chains which strongly depends on the sequence. In this work, we develop a novel coarse-grained (CG) DNA model in order to deeply understand the complex biophysical reactions of DNA. In our model, a nucleotide is mapped to one CG bead and the corresponding force field is extracted and optimized according to the experimental data in terms of the melting temperatures of DNA and the persistence lengths of DNA chain. Meanwhile, the force field of DNA model is rectified according to the bulk thermodynamic properties of DNA to eliminate the finite size effect in simulation. After parameter optimization, our coarse-grained model is able to reproduce the sequence characteristic of DNA and maximize the simulation efficiency. This model is then applied to investigate a toehold-mediated strand displacement system. The simulation is excellently agreed with the experimental data in term of the displacement rates associated with different toehold lengths, which firmly proves that such model can be potentially applied to study the thermodynamic and kinetic properties in a variety of DNA nanotechnologies.
326	Activation energy impact in von K&#x00E1;rm&#x00E1;n swirling flow due to a rotating disk	A new mathematical model is proposed to investigate the flow patterns with heat and mass characteristics of an electrically conducting Maxwell nanofluid over a rotating stretchable disk in the presence of an externally applied uniform magnetic field. Brownian motion and thermophoresis features are incorporated due to nanoparticles accounting Buongiorno model. The characteristics of non-linear thermal radiations on heat transfer mechanism are studied in view of Rosseland approximation model. The mass transfer analysis is inspected by employing the binary chemical reaction with activation energy. Similarity hypotheses is performed to facilitate the solution of governing momentum, energy and concentration equations. The transformed non-linear equations are attempted numerically by using bvp midrich scheme in Maple software for visualizing the influence of governing parameters graphically and numerically. The major outcomes of present analysis reveal that radiation parameter enhances the temperature of the fluid. Solute concentration is an increasing function of activation energy parameter. Moreover, the reaction rate diminishes the solute concentration.
327	<strong>Physisorption of oxygen in SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles for perovskite solar cells</strong>	Although SnO<sub>2 </sub>is widely used in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as electron transport layer, there is still a need of detailed investigation regarding the impact of adsorption on the performance of PSCs. Here, we report the role of physical and chemical adsorption process on SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles thin film for the performance of planar heterojunction MAPbI<sub>3</sub>-based PSCs. Oxygen adsorption plays an important role on oxidation states and defective oxides related to the oxygen vacancies in the SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles thin films. The SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles thin film show higher oxidation state (Sn-O) and lower defective oxides (O-Sn-C) at an annealing temperature of 100 &deg;C due to physisorption, also higher efficiency (18.04 %) of planar heterojunction solar cell. Higher annealing temperature results in desorption of physically adsorbed oxygen species. Therefore, lowering down the annealing temperature of SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles thin films is a good strategy to control the oxidation states and oxygen vacancies related to the surface of thin films.
328	<strong>Superhard Q-carbon nanocomposites</strong>	We present a single-step strategy to fabricate adherent coatings of superhard and lubricating Q-carbon nanocomposites by laser melting and ultrafast quenching of amorphous carbon thin films, at ambient temperature and pressure in air. The Q-carbon nanocomposites consist of densely-packed <em>sp<sup>3</sup></em>-rich Q-carbon, and <em>sp<sup>2</sup></em>-rich <em>&alpha;</em>-carbon amorphous phases. Since this transformation is undercooling dependent, we control the undercooling by changing thermal conductivity <em>via</em> increasing <em>sp<sup>3</sup></em> content in as-deposited amorphous carbon films and stimulate ultrafast regrowth rate. The Q-carbon nanocomposites exhibit a hardness of 67 GPa (Young&rsquo;s modulus ~840 GPa), an increase of 220% over DLC, in contrast to the soft <em>&alpha;</em>-carbon (hardness ~18 GPa). The high hardness of Q-carbon nanocomposites results in 0.16 energy dispersion coefficient, in comparison with 0.74 for <em>&alpha;</em>-carbon. The soft <em>&alpha;</em>-carbon phase provides lubrication, resulting in low friction and wear coefficients of 0.09 and 1x10<sup>-6</sup>, respectively, against the diamond tip. The Q-carbon nanocomposites consisting of hard Q-carbon and soft<em> &alpha;</em>-carbon phases, with nanoscale dispersion, increases toughness of the film. This work provides insights into the characteristics of Q-carbon nanocomposites and advances carbon-based superhard materials for long lasting protective coatings and related applications.
329	Reducing stimulated emission threshold power density of AlGaN/AlN multiple quantum wells by nano-trench-patterned AlN template	272-nm deep-ultraviolet stimulated emission is demonstrated by optical pumping from AlGaN/AlN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) grown on nano-patterned AlN templates by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition upon sapphire substrates. Continuous low threading dislocation density (TDD) MQWs zones in parallel with the stimulated light emission direction above the epitaxy lateral overgrowth (ELOG) coalescent areas are obtained by aligning the nano-trench pattern perpendicular to Fabry-Perot cavity facets thus When light resonates through the continuous low TDD MQWs zones, it has higher optical gain and less non-radiative recombination than the case on the nano-net-patterned AlN template where the low TDD zones are discontinuous. Therefore, the threshold power density of 713 kW/cm<sup>2</sup> from the MQWs on the nano-trench-patterned AlN template is achieved, 11% lower than that on the nano-net-patterned AlN template. This result indicates that nano-trench-patterned templates can benefit the performance of AlGaN-based waveguide laser diodes.

331	<strong>Nanotribological Properties of Bulk Metallic Glasses</strong>	Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) exhibit unique mechanical properties; however, a detailed understanding of nanotribological properties of BMGs is still lacking. In this article, alloy composition, surface disorder, normal load, and velocity dependence of friction between a single asperity contact and the BMG surface is explored with two-dimensional Prandtl-Tomlinson (PT) model. Our numerical results reveal distinct regimes for load and velocity dependence of friction at small length scales. The friction is inert to alloy composition and surface roughness for small loads in wearless regime. Surface corrugation increases with the number of alloy elements and dominates the friction for normal loads that may lead wear. Calculations for the effect of sliding velocity on friction between a single-atom contact and different BMGs show that velocity dependence of friction is inert to alloy composition and surface structure for sliding velocities smaller than 1.3 &mu;m/s. Besides, the friction evolves non-monotonically with alloy composition and surface disorder for larger sliding velocities. Our analyses disclose that BMGs unveil two unique frictional properties at small length scales: (I) friction is inert to alloy composition and surface disorder in wearless friction regime, (II) velocity dependence of friction does not depend on composition and disorder for small sliding speeds. These results promote BMGs as ideal materials for applications that require high durability and low friction in quasi-dynamic operating conditions.
332	Point-projection microscopy of nano-localized photoemission currents at sub-40 femtosecond time scales	Femtosecond point-projection microscopy (fs-PPM) is an electron microscopy technique that possesses a combination of high spatio-temporal resolution and sensitivity to local electric fields. This allows it to visualize ultrafast charge carrier dynamics in complex nanomaterials. We benchmark the capability of the fs-PPM technique by imaging the ultrafast dynamics of charge carriers produced by multiphoton ionization of silver nanowires. The space-charge driven motion of photoelectrons is followed on sub-100 nm length scales, while the dynamics are captured on 30--100 fs time scales. The build-up of electron holes in the silver nanowires following photoelectron ejection, \ie positive charging, has also been observed. The fastest observed photoelectron temporal response is 33 fs (FWHM), which represents an upper estimate of the instrument response function and is consistent with an expected electron wavepacket duration of 13 fs based on simulations.
333	Optical nanofiber temperature monitoring via double heterodyne detection	Tapered optical fibers (nanofibers) whose diameters are smaller than the optical wavelength are very fragile and can be easily destroyed if excessively heated by energy dissipated from the transmitted light. We present a technique for monitoring the nanofiber temperature using two-stage heterodyne detection. The phase of the heterodyne output signal is determined by that of the transmitted optical field, which, in turn, depends on the temperature through the refractive index. From the phase data, by numerically solving the heat exchange equations, the temperature distribution along the nanofiber is determined. The technique is applied to the controlled heating of the nanofiber by a laser in order to remove rubidium atoms adsorbed on its surface that substantially degrade its transmission. Almost 90% of the nanofiber's original transmission is recovered.
334	Surface damage of silicon induced by combined millisecond and nanosecond laser with different delays	The laser-silicon interaction process was investigated with a new form of double pulse laser, which was called combined pulse laser (CPL). CPL includes a millisecond (ms) superposed by a nanosecond (ns) pulses. The surface damage morphology was investigated under a single ms laser and CPL irradiation. In comparison, the damage effect induced by CPL was more severe, and it can be divided into three kinds according to different delays. Further research was done on the melting depth and damage radius. It was found that the damage radius on the surface mainly depends on the energy density of incident ms laser, and the melting depth decreases with the increase of delay time. The more severe damage effect of CPL was ascribed to the pre-heating ms laser and the interaction of the follow-up ms laser with the surface damage formed by the ns laser.
335	Spin-relaxation anisotropy in a nanowire quantum dot with strong spin-orbit coupling	We study the impacts of the magnetic field direction on the spin dynamics in a one-dimensional quantum dot with strong spin-orbit coupling. The energy spectrum and the corresponding eigen-sfunctions in the quantum dot are obtained exactly. We find that no matter how large the spin-orbit coupling is, the electric-dipole spin transition rate as a function of the magnetic field direction alwaysshas a &#x03C0; periodicity. However, the phonon-induced spin relaxation rate as a function of the magnetic field direction has a &#x03C0; periodicity only in the weak spin-orbit coupling regime and a 2&#x03C0; periodicitysin the strong spin-orbit coupling regime.
336	Molecular dynamics simulation of resonant frequency of graphene nanoribbons	The resonant frequency of the graphene nanoribbon is studied by the molecular dynamics simulation method, which is modulated the dynamic process of vibration after deformation by silicon probe. A series of simulations for the resonant frequency of graphene nanoribbons have been performed. Then the simulation results of resonant frequency are analyzed, which are varied with the length, width, thickness and temperature of graphene nanoribbons. The resonant frequency of graphene nanoribbons is depended on size. The width, thickness and temperature have less influence on the resonant frequency of graphene nanoribbons, and the scale of the length is the main influence.
337	Test bed for contact-mode triboelectric nanogenerator	The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has become one of the strongest candidates for sustainable power sources. The power of a TENG depends on factors such as contact area, contact parallelism, contact force, and contact speed. In order to evaluate the  performance of the TENG precisely and quantitatively, it is necessary to apply consistent experimental conditions and measurement processes. In this paper, we propose a test bed capable of adjusting the contact area and contact parallelism, and measuring the contact force, contact speed, current, and voltage in real time. The test bed consists of a 2-axis planar stage, a 2-axis tilting stage, a 1-axis vertical stage, a 3-degree-of-freedom (DOF) force/torque sensor, a capacitive displacement sensor, and a voice coil actuator. The 3-DOF force/torque sensor can provide feedback on the degree of parallelism and contact area alignment as well as contact force. With the proposed test bed, the effects of parallelism error, contact area, contact force, and contact speed on the performance of contact-mode TENGs are quantitatively analyzed. This test bed is expected to be used for the quantitative analysis of contact-mode TENGs with various new structures and for comparison among different devices.
338	<strong>Integrating semiconducting co-catalyst of ReS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets into p-silicon photocathodes toward enhanced solar water reduction</strong>	A heterojunction photocathode of p-Si/ReS<sub>2</sub> was fabricated through uniform growth of vertically standing ReS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets (NSs) on planar p-Si substrate for solar-driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The grafted ReS<sub>2</sub> NSs not only serve as a high-activity HER catalyst but also render a suitable electronic band&nbsp;coupled with p-Si into a &#x2161;-type heterojunction, which facilitates the photo-induced charge separation and utilization. This device achieves a 23-fold-increased photocurrent density at 0 V<sub>RHE</sub> and a 35-fold-enhanced photoconversion ef&#xFB01;ciency compared to pure p-Si counterpart. The multi effects of ReS<sub>2</sub> incorporation in improving light harvesting, photo-generated charge separation and catalytic activity are demonstrated to be responsible for the enhanced PEC performance, suggesting the multifunction of semiconducting co-catalysts integrated into solar water splitting devices.
339	Novel focusing properties of high-numerical-aperture micro-Fresnel zone plates	Focusing properties of high-numerical-aperture micro-Fresnel zone plates (&mu;FZP) have been explored at the wavelength from deep ultraviolet to visible. Numerical calculations are based on vectorial angular spectrum theory. It is found that the axial spot size evaluated by full-width-at-half-maximum is in direct proportion to the inverse of the total annulus number. Linear focal shift phenomenon can be observed due to the wavelength dispersion over a range of tens of nanometers. With the illumination wavelength increasing, the focus is negatively shifting and the peak intensity is first increasing and then decreasing. Meanwhile, the axial focal spot is shrinking while it is broadening along the transverse focal plane. A new method has been demonstrated to probe either multi-focus or a light needle based on high-NA FZPs. The results have been rigorously validated by the three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method. This study has changed and expanded the basic understandings of the widely-used FZPs.
340	<strong>Two photon induced amplified spontaneous emission at low threshold from Styryl 7 dye incorporated DNA template</strong>	Studies on biophysical interactions between DNA-surfactant complexes and dye molecules are necessary to fully exploit its potential in optoelectronic devices. In this work iinvestigations on nonlinear optical absorption of Styryl 7 dye (LDS 750) incorporating DNA-CTMA (deoxyribonucleic acid blended with cationic surfactant molecule, cetyltrimethyl-ammonium chloride) and PMMA (Poly methyl methacrylate) using Z-scan technique is reported. The sample exhibits reverse saturable absorption with DNA -CTMA complex but with PMMA the sample behaves as a saturable absorber. Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) from Styryl 7 dye with DNA- CTMA and PMMA were also studied. We observed ASE at low pump energy for Styryl 7&ndash;DNA-CTMA film, when excited with a pulsed nanosecond Nd: YAG laser (&lambda;=532nm) whereas ASE was not observed from dye incorporated with PMMA even with high pump energy. ASE characteristics were studied as a function of excitation energy density for the evaluation of threshold energy and exponential gain coefficient. The enhanced fluorescence and low threshold for ASE make Styryl 7 dye - DNA template a promising candidate for novel optoelectronic applications.
341	<strong>Determining the confined optical length of high index vertical Si nanoforest arrays for photonic applications</strong>	We report on the structural and the optical properties of Si nanowires fabricated by a facile electroless etching technique by varying the optical length (H) of nanowire. The theoretical calculation for exponential sine (ES) profile at constant &lambda;=600 nm shows a better explanation in terms of gradient index with optical length for a vertical nanowires. All the prior observations signify the possibility of strong light trapping due to an exponential gradient towards the high index into the nanowires and the existence of highly dense subwavelength features. The optical admittance (&#x01B5;) shows a strong impact on optical distance (Z) for Z&lt;H, owing to the EM wave interaction with the nanowires that perceive a different &#x01B5; at the oblique angle of incidence (AOI). In addition, the experimental reflectance data and theoretical model for <em>TE </em>and <em>TM</em> modes predict that a minimum optical length of 5 &micro;m can give a very low reflectance value. This indicates that the Si nanowires is polarization insensitive at oblique incidence over a wide AOI (0&ordm;-80&ordm;). Moreover, Raman spectra showed a very strong light confinement effect in the first order transverse optical band with increasing the etching depths. The morphological dependent resonance (MDR) theory for SiNWs describes a strong localized light field confinement for lower wavelength regime up to 600 nm and its effect on the strong resonant absorption modes was further correlated by using COMSOL simulation. The present results should benefit to harness the maximum absorption confined within the nanowires for various photonic application.
342	<strong>Thermoelectric characterization</strong><strong> of nickel-nanowires and nanoparticles embedded in silica aerogels</strong>	Embedded nickel nanowires (NiNWs) and nickel nanoparticles (NiNPs) in silica aerogels at three different concentrations are characterized and considered as potential thermoelectric materials. The embedded NiNWs samples exhibit a 9 orders of magnitude improvement in thermoelectric figure of merit while the embedded NiNPs samples show a 6 orders of magnitude improvement when the concentration of the NiNWs and NiNPs are increased from 0 to 700 ppm. The electrical properties are assessed using four-point probe techniques and thermal conductivity is measured using scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) and compared with HotDisk measurements. The electrical resistivity is highly sensitive to the concentration of NiNWs and NiNPs in the silica aerogel, while the thermal conductivity remains largely unchanged. The sample resistivity is shown to follow a percolation scaling law of the form &nbsp;with critical weight fraction &nbsp;to form a conductive network of approximately at 0.04-0.6 Wt% and 0.08-0.1 Wt% for embedded NiNWs and NiNPs respectively. The results suggest that optimizing the concentration of NiNWs could yield promising thermoelectric properties. The measurement techniques were also used to investigate the uniformity of the aerogels, which was not degraded by the incorporation of fillers.
343	<strong>The temperature dependence of saturation magnetization for yttrium iron garnet doped with Zn, Ni and Co</strong>	The empirical extended Bloch&acute;s law about the saturation magnetization behavior as a function of temperature was used for study nanoparticles of yttrium iron garnet doped with zinc, nickel and cobalt. The exponent values obtained from the fitting vary from 1.42 to 9.68, and are different from the expected values; 9/2, 2, 3/2, 3 and 5/2. The discrepancy was associated to the existence of defects and moments with frustrated exchange interaction due to the nanoparticles size and thermal treatment. Other adjustment attempt was performed including a linear term taking into account the nanometric size of the particles, showing great discrepancy with the experimental results. The results are attributed to the atomic disorder and some possible magnetic frustrations.
344	Comment on "Excellent field emission properties of VO2(A) nanogap emitters in air"	Recently, Liu \textit{et al.} \cite{Liu2018} reported interesting field emission properties of metal VO$_{2}$(A) nanowires with a small gap distance ($d_{g} \sim 10$ nm) to the collector, in air environment. The authors claimed that the field emission properties of VO$_{2}$(A) nanowires were shown to be enhanced with an increase in ambient temperature due to a decrease in the work function. The latter was extracted from experimental current-voltage characteristics, by using their Eq.(1), derived from elementary Fowler-Nordheim (FN) theory. However, the criticisms presented in this comment show that this conclusion is fully questionable. This is mainly due to the following inconsistencies presented in Ref.\cite{Liu2018}: (i) the use of the elementary FN theory in situations where such theory is not expected to be valid and (ii) an unreasonable approach used for a local gap field enhancement factor estimation, in the limit of small gap distance. The inconsistencies (i) and (ii) make the work function values reported for VO$_{2}$(A) nanowires, as well as its functional dependence with the ambient temperature, misleading.
345	Model of ballistic-diffusive thermal transport in HAMR media	A 1D finite element model of nanoscale heat transfer is developed that considers the grain size and temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity and specific heat of the FePt recording layer during heat assisted recording. Ballistic effects on the thermal conductivity are included assuming diffuse scattering at interfaces and grain boundaries. The magnon contribution to the specific heat during laser heating close to the Curie temperature is determined using the finite size scaling theory. Local variations in temperature are shown to arise as a result of the dispersion in FePt grain size&sigma;. The model predicts an inhomogeneous temperature distribution within a single FePt grain that is significant for smaller in-plane grain size.
346	Effective quality factor tuning mechanisms in micromechanical resonators	Quality factor (Q) is an important property of the micro- and nano-electromechanical (MEM/NEM) resonators that underlie timing references, atomic force microscopes, and all other resonant sensors. There are many ways to tune the effective quality factor of MEM/NEM resonators, including external velocity-proportional feedback, parametric amplification, optomechanical back-action, thermal-piezoresistive pumping, and mechanical modal coupling. We review these mechanisms, and demonstrate their equivalence by representing each effective Q tuning technique by a position-proportional and a velocity-proportional force expression. We clarify the relationship between the mechanical Q, the effective Q, and the thermal noise of a resonator, and experimentally show that parametric amplification and thermal-piezoresistive pumping enhance the effective Q, not the mechanical Q, by studying the thermomechanical fluctuations of a micromechanical resonator subjected to these techniques. This paper also reports the first experimental demonstration of the phase slope tuning of a mechanical resonator subjected to parametric amplification.
347	Bias Temperature Instability Model Using Dynamic Defect Potential for Predicting CMOS Aging	This paper describes a new approach for modeling bias-temperature instability (BTI) in nanoscale transistors. The model uses non-iterative surface potential solvers enhanced with dynamic defect potential equations to enable accurate, physics-based circuit level simulations that incorporate BTI effects. Defect maps constructed from experimental data reported on high-k-metal-gate bulk complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices are used to parameterize the defect potential equation. By implementing the enhanced surface potential model in Verilog-A, both DC and AC BTI aging effects in combinational circuits are simulated and the results compared conventional threshold voltage shift methods for BTI modeling.

Structural characterizations (X-ray and electron diffraction patterns, (high-resolution) TEM images) provide information regarding the phase formation and the single-crystalline nature of the LPCMO systems. X-ray and electron diffraction patterns reveal that all the LPCMO samples crystallize in perovskite crystallography with an orthorhombic structure (<em>Pnma</em> space group), where the MnO<sub>6</sub> octahedron elongated along the <em>b</em> axis due to the Jahn - Teller effect is confirmed by Raman spectra. Crystallite sizes and grain sizes were calculated from XRD and TEM respectively, and the lattice fringes resolved in the high-resolution TEM images of individual LPCMO nanoparticle confirmed its single-crystalline nature. FTIR spectra identify the characteristic Mn-O bond stretching vibration mode near 600 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which shifts towards high wavenumbers with increasing post-annealing temperature or Pr-doped concentration, resulting in further distortion of the MnO<sub>6</sub> octahedron. XPS revealed dual oxidation states of Mn<sup>3+</sup> and Mn<sup>4+</sup> in the LPCMO nanoparticles. UV-Vis absorption spectra confirm the semiconducting nature of the LPCMO nanoparticles with optical bandgaps of 2.55 eV - 2.71 eV. Magnetic measurements as a function of temperature and magnetic field at field cooling (FC) and zero-field cooling (ZFC) modes, provided a Curie temperature around 230 K, saturation magnetization of about 81 emu/g and coercive field of 390 Oe at 10 K. Such magnetic properties and the semiconducting nature of the LPCMO nanoparticles will make them as suitable candidate for magnetic semiconductor spintronics.
349	Silica nano-particles annealing treatment and its effect on chemical mechanical polishing	SiO2 spherical nano-particles are annealed with different temperature. The structural and morphological evolution of silica nano-particles induced by heat treatment are monitored by scanning electron microscopy(SEM), X-Ray diffraction(XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrum(FTIR) and differential thermal and thermal gravimetric analysis, which disclose the external and internal structure of silica abrasive. The mechanical hardness of silica is measured by nano-indentation technique, which shows the hardness increases as the annealed temperature raising. Silica nanoparticles after annealing are applied as abrasives in chemical mechanical polishing for silicon wafers, showing that material removal rate is improved with the annealed temperature, whereas the surface roughness remains low level as the annealing temperature below 600{degree sign}C.
350	Impact of Hall Current and Nonlinear Thermal Radiation on Jeffrey Nanofluid Flow In The Rotating Frame with Porous Medium	This research article deal with the nonlinear thermally radiated influences on non-Newtonian nanofluid considering (Jeffrey fluid) in a rotating system. The effect of Hall current on the nanofluid is taken into the account. The flow of nanofluid is steady and the medium is a porous. The upper plate is considered fixed and the lower plate kept stretched. The governing equations of the nanofluid  have been transformed to a set of differential nonlinear and coupled equations, using suitable similarity variables and other assumptions. The optimal approach is used to get the solution of the high ordered modeled problems. The convergence of the method has been shown numerically. The variation of the Skin friction, Nusslet number, Sherwood number and their impacts on the velocity distribution, temperature distribution and concentration distribution have been examined. The influence of the Hall effect, rotation, Brownian motion, porosity and thermophoresis analysis have mainly focused in this investigation. Moreover, for comprehension the physical presentation of the embedded parameters, like Deborah number , viscosity parameter  , rotation parameter , Brownian motion parameter , porosity parameter , magnetic parameter , Prandtl number , thermophoretic parameter , and Schmidt number  have been  plotted and deliberated graphically.

352	Highly Stable Silica-coated Manganese Ferrite Nanoparticles as High-efficacy T2 Contrast Agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging	Highly stable silica-coated manganese ferrite nanoparticles were fabricated for application as magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) contrast agents. The manganese ferrite nanoparticles were synthesized using a hydrothermal technique and coated with silica. The particle size was investigated using transmission electron microscopy and was found to be 40-60 nm. The presence of the silica coating on the particle surface was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The crystalline structure was investigated by X-ray diffraction, and the particles were revealed to have an inverse spinel structure. Superparamagnetism was confirmed by the magnetic hysteresis curves obtained using a vibrating sample magnetometer. The efficiency of the MRI contrast agents was investigated by using aqueous solutions of the particles in a 4.7 T MRI scanner. The T1 and T2 relaxivities of the particles were 1.42 and 60.65 s-1 mM-1, respectively, in water. The ratio r2/r1 was 48.91, confirming that the silica-coated manganese ferrite nanoparticles were suitable high-efficacy T2 contrast agents.
353	Experimental evaluation of gold nanoparticles as infrared scatterers for advanced cardiovascular optical imaging	The tremendous impact that cardiovascular diseases have in modern society is motivating the research of novel imaging techniques that would make possible early diagnosis and, therefore, efficient treatments. Cardiovascular optical coherence tomography (CV-OCT) emerges as result of such demand has already being used at the clinical level. Full exploit of CV-OCT requires the development of novel contrast molecular agents characterized by a large scattering efficiency in the infrared (800-1400 nm). Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) seem to be the best candidates but their scattering properties in the infrared are hardly known and in most of the cases, these are extracted from numerical simulations. This knowledge gap is here covered by providing an experimental evaluation of the infrared scattering properties of different GNPs (nanoshells, nanostars and nanorods) by a unique combination of techniques (thermal loading experiments, infrared optical coherence tomography, infrared dark field microscopy and optoacoustic spectroscopy). This work determines experimentally the influence of the geometry on the spectral response of the scattering efficiency of GNPs and evidences the existence of remarkable discrepancies between experimental data and numerical simulations.
354	<strong>Carbon Nanotube Polarization Modulation at Far Infrared Range by Thermo-activated Phonon Absorption</strong>	We demonstrate a far infrared polarizer made with super-aligned carbon nanotube based on thermo-activated phonon absorption. It is found that the transmission modulation depth increases with temperature in the range of 100-600 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>. The modulation depth can reach 1.5 dB by 0.5 V heating for per 1 mm sample width. The modulation is attributed to the thermo-activated phonon absorption of carbon nanotube. The degree of polarization is increased to 80% at 641 K from 40% at RT. It is shown that the degree of polarization can be improved and modulated by heating. The commercialization prospects will be attractive in the future due to the facile fabrication and tunable property.
355	Fundamentals of the nanowire solar cell. Optimization of the open circuit voltage	Present day nanowire solar cells have reached an efficiency of 17.8%. It is the main purpose of this review to highlight recent progress in nanophotonic engineering to further enhance the open circuit voltage (Voc) of a nanowire solar cell. It will be shown that the light extraction efficiency is a major design criterium for enhancing the external radiative efficiency and thus the Voc. Since the semiconductor substrate is a sink for internally generated photoluminescence, it is equally important to eliminate the loss of emitted light into the substrate. The radiative limit for the Voc, which corresponds to one of the necessary conditions in the Shockley Queisser (S-Q) limit, is reached when the external radiative efficiency at the front side of the cell equals unity. Even at the S-Q limit, the Voc is still substantially decreased by a photon entropy loss due to the conversion of a parallel beam of photons from the sun into a randomized emission pattern, in which each individual photon is emitted into a random direction. The 46.7% ultimate solar cell limit for direct solar irradiation can only be approached, once the cell is capable to focus all emitted photoluminescence back to the sun. We expect that nanophotonic engineering will provide a pathway to approach this limit. Nanophotonic engineering also allows to combine a high Voc with a large short-circuit current (Isc) by using tapered nanowires and forward Mie scattering for efficient absorption of the solar light into the nanowires. A prerequisite for this approach is a nanowire array with a high internal photoluminescence efficiency and thus a long minority carrier lifetime. Recent progress on radiative emission lifetime in nanowire arrays is finally reviewed. We conclude with the economics of nanowire solar cells.
356	Investigations on the plasma enabled growth of vertical graphene sheets on CNT surface	A theoretical model is developed to study the nucleation and growth kinetics of vertical graphene (VG) sheet on the carbon nanotubes (CNT) surfacein a reactive low temperature plasma environment. The model considers the plasma sheath formalization in one-dimension along with the kinetics of all the plasma species, charging of the graphene sheet, and growth of VG sheet on the CNT surface owing todefects generation and various processes on the CNT surface. Using the model, we demonstrated that variations in the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD)process control parameters, such as the total gas pressure, input power, and substrate bias can be used for significant variation in the plasma composition and characteristics that in turn control the ion bombardment and carbon species generation on the CNT surface, and consequently tune the VG sheet dimensions (i.e., height and thickness) and their number density profiles on the CNT surface. It is found that as the total gas pressure is lowered and the input power and substrate bias are enhanced, the number densities and height of the VG sheet on the CNT surface are increased; however, the thickness of the VG sheet is reduced.Some of our theoretical results are in good agreement with the existing experimental observations.
357	<strong>Nonlinear plasmonic behavior of nanohole arrays in thin gold films for imaging of lipids</strong>	We demonstrate linear and nonlinear plasmonic behavior of periodic nanohole arrays in thin gold (Au) films with varying periodicity. The linear optical transmission spectra of the nanohole arrays show a red-shift of the resonance wavelength and the Wood&rsquo;s anomaly with increasing hole spacing. The optical transmission and electric near-field intensity distribution of the nanohole arrays were simulated using the finite element method (FEM). The nonlinear plasmonic behavior of the nanohole arrays was studied by using picosecond pulsed excitation at near infrared wavelengths. The characteristic nonlinear signals indicating two-photon excited luminescence (TPEL), sum frequency generation (SFG), second harmonic generation (SHG) and four-wave mixing (FWM) were observed. The maximum FWM/TPEL signal intensity ratio for the nanohole arrays with periodicity of 500 nm was achieved. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the ability of surface-enhanced coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (SECARS) to visualize low concentration of lipids deposited on the nanohole array having a periodicity of 500 nm.
358	<strong>A novel constitutive model for the mechanical properties of silica aerogels</strong>	Most studies on the mechanical properties of silica aerogels neglected the influence of structural randomness and the dead-ends of nano-porous materials, whereas both of them have a considerable effect on the mechanical properties of silica aerogels. In this study, we propose a cubic frame model with random orientation as the representative volume element (RVE) of silica aerogel to investigate the dead-ends&rsquo; effect on its mechanical properties. To characterize the structural randomness in the open-cell porous materials, a new constitutive model is established by a statistically average of the mechanical response of the random structure. This constitutive model reveals the inherent isotropy of open-cell porous materials. It also indicates the widely-used Gibson-Ashby model may overestimate the Young&rsquo;s modulus and shear modulus for open-cell porous materials. Then the mass ratio of dead-ends and effective skeleton are derived using available experimental results. It shows that the mass ratio of dead-ends increases with the decreasing density of silica aerogels because of the more space resulted from slimmer effective skeleton, which results in the abnormal exponent of the Young&rsquo;s modulus-density power-law relation. We suggest the mass ratio of the effective skeleton to be an intuitive and practical index to reflect the connectivity in silica aerogels. Besides, the dead-ends can significantly enhance the compressive strength of silica aerogels, especially for low-density silica aerogels. We hope this work can provide a new idea to consider the structural randomness in porous materials and give guidance on the mechanical reinforcement of aerogels.
359	A high-voltage subnanosecond sharpener based on a combination of "open" and capillary discharges	The switching features of a new gas-discharge sharpener consisting of a series connection of open and capillary discharges in one device have been studied. Subnanosecond times of its transition into high conductivity mode have been obtained in helium, neon, and argon in a wide range of conditions at a voltage pulse compression degree of ~ 10<sup>3</sup>. The average power of ~ 10 kW has been achieved in the pulse train mode at a voltage of 20 kV and a pulse repetition rate of 44 kHz. The conditions under which the switching time can be 100 ps have been determined.
360	Synthesis and characterization of nickel doped Barium niobate Ba(Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Nb<sub>0.5</sub>)O<sub>3</sub> (BNN) nanomaterial	Ferroelectric materials are of great interest for researchers worldwide, because of their unique physical properties and wide range of applications. The composite nanomaterial Ba(NiNb)<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>[BNN] was synthesized by conventional solid state reaction method. The structural characterization was done by x- ray diffraction (XRD). The research was carried out to investigate structural properties of BNN nanomaterial as a function of sintering duration. BNN is sintered at 1000<sup>0</sup>C and different samples are prepared by varying duration of heat treatment. It is found that there is no major difference in structural properties of BNN when heated up to 12 hours, but there is a sudden change in structural properties when material is sintered for 18 hours.&nbsp; Average grain size calculated is 50.49 nm and lattice parameter 4.1281 A<sup>0</sup> with cubic crystal structure.
361	<strong>An <em>in silico</em> Inter-subject Variability Study of Extra-thoracic Morphology Effects on Inhaled Particle Transport and Deposition</strong>	An understanding of human inter-subject variability is crucial for the implementation of personalized pulmonary drug delivery as well as exposure assessment of airborne hazardous materials. However, due to the lack of statistically robust data and subsequent comparisons, the influence of human respiratory morphology on inhaled nano-/micro-particle transport and deposition is still not fully known. Thus, focusing on identifying geometric parameters that significantly influence airflow and inhaled particle transport/deposition, an experimentally validated Computational Fluid-Particle Dynamics (CFPD) model based on the Euler-Lagrange method is developed. To enhance the statistical robustness of the investigation, a virtual population group is created that contains seven distinct and widely used human upper-airway configurations, where the same tracheobronchial trees are extended to Generation 6 (G6). Numerical results and the inter-subject variability analysis indicate that the glottis constriction is the morphological parameter that significantly impacts the inhaled particle dynamics in the respiratory tract. Anatomical features of the upper airways should be maintained to capture the <em>personalized</em> airflow and particle transport dynamics for particles smaller than 500 nm or larger than 2 &micro;m. However, a single upper airway model, representing a basic subpopulation group, can be employed to evaluate the <em>total</em> deposition of particles in the diameter range of 500 nm &lt;d<sub>p</sub>&lt; 2 &micro;m. The present study provides an <em>in silico</em> lung-aerosol dynamics framework with detailed particle-deposition results and new physical insight. It may serve as a guide for implementing optimal targeting of inhaled drug-aerosols as well as for the assessment of hazardous aerosol exposure in distinct populations.
362	Growth of well-oriented InN nanodots by magnetron sputtering with varying sputtering temperature	I nN nanodots were deposited on sapphire substrates by radio-frequency (rf) magnetron sputtering under different sputtering temperature. The structure and morphology results revealed that the as grown InN samples showed a well oriented nanodots morphology with a wurtzite crystallographic structure under c-axis preferred growth orientation. The XPS results indicated that the In atoms existed only as combined InN not In2O3 and the atomic ratio of In/N was approximately 1:1.06. Moreover, the optical absorption measurement exhibited that the energy band-gap of InN nanodots were around 1.68-2.01 eV. And the electrical properties of the InN nanodots were also discussed by Hall effect in detail.
363	Enhancement of optical emission and ion currents in a laser produced silicon plasma by Femtosecond Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structuring (fs-LIPSS)	<em>Laser-induced</em><em> periodic surface structuring (LIPSS) is a powerful technique for modifying the surface properties of solids. Using ultrashort pulses from a Ti:Sapphire laser (800 nm, 100 fs) we have fabricated nanoscale order LIPSS patterns</em> <em>on a silicon (100) surface. The patterns are found to be strongly dependent on the laser pulse energy, state of polarization, number of shots delivered on the target, and the ambient pressure. The role of laser wavelength is studied by using the second harmonic output (400 nm) also for fabrication. Large area (5x4 mm<sup>2</sup>) surface structuring has been carried out at atmospheric pressure after optimizing the laser parameters at 800 nm. The patterned silicon surface shows a substantial reduction in the reflection of incident light over a wide range of wavelengths, in comparison to plain silicon. Moreover, when used for laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) experiments, enhanced optical emission and ion current have been observed from the patterned surface. This indicates that coupling of laser energy to the surface is enhanced in the case of patterned silicon. While spectral lines emitted by doubly ionized silicon have been observed from the patterned surface, the plain surface gives lines from singly ionized silicon only.</em> <em>A discernible enhancement has been measured in both optical (50-90%) and electrical (34%) signals from the plasma generated on the patterned surface. These results confirm that LIPSS is a versatile method for enhancing the coupling of laser energy on to irradiated solid surfaces.</em>
364	Polyacrylates in the Presence of an Extraordinary Monovalent Cation - Solution Behavior and Metal Nanoparticle Formation	Sodium polyacrylate (NaPA) in dilute aqueous solution at an ionic strength of [NaNO3] = 0.01 M establishes a rich phase behaviour in the presence of low amounts of silver cations, which were introduced at a few millimoles or less by replacing the corresponding amount of Na+ cations. Beyond an extremely low level of Ag+ cations, anionic PA chains aggregate. By increasing the concentration of Ag+, the aggregates become denser and keep on growing without limit. Once a certain range of [Ag+] is reached, the instantaneously formed dense aggregates remain stable. Irradiation of the PA aggregate solutions with UV-light induces formation of silver nanoparticles (Ag-Np). Based on a combination of UV-vis spectroscopy, light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and small angle neutron scattering, the mechanism of this NaPA assisted formation of Ag-Np is studied. One focus of the study is lying on the effect of the two different solution states of dense aggregates, corresponding to the unstable, growing AgPA aggregates and to the stable AgPA aggregates and another focus is aiming at a characterisation of the morphology of the generated hybrid particles composed of Ag-Np and hosting PA chains.
365	<strong>Self-Powered GaN Nanostructured Ultraviolet Photodetector with rapid Reversibility</strong>	We report the fabrication of self-powered GaN nanostructures based ultraviolet photodetector on Si (111) substrate. Non-homogeneous nanoislands were perceived on Si surface with an average spatial distribution of 50 nm and thickness of 30 nm. The performance parameters such as photosensitivity, detectivity, photo responsivity, low noise equivalent power of fabricated GaN ultraviolet photodetector under self-powered mode are ~10<sup>2</sup>, ~10<sup>9 </sup>Jones, 1.78 mA/W and 8.8&times;10<sup>-11</sup> WHz<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The transient photo-response measurement revealed a rapid rise and decay time constants of ~18 ms and ~27 ms, respectively. The GaN photodetector displayed significant enhancement in photocurrent and detectivity with increasing power (1 mW to 13 mW). These self-powered characteristics of the GaN ultraviolet photodetector are attributed to inhomogeneous contact area. The nanostructured self-powered GaN photodetector paves way towards Energy efficient optoelectronic device applications.
366	<strong>Thermoelectric Power Factor Enhancement of Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub> Thin Films by Pulsed Plasma Engineering</strong>	Precise control over microstructure and composition is desired prerequisite for the performance enhancement of thermoelectric materials. In conventional magnetron plasma sputtering synthesis, composition control is challenging when the sputtering-target is composed by different elements. Here, the potential of pulsed power utilization is demonstrated for compositional control of Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub> thin films <em>via</em> pulse -reversal time and -frequency engineering in pulsed DC-magnetron sputtering process. Amorphous thin films (of 200 nm thickness), deposited on glass substrate, crystallized in to face centered cubic phase with average nanocrystallite size ~10 nm, when annealed at 400 <sup>o</sup>C for 1 h in vacuum conditions. Power density enhancement to 5.56 W/cm<sup>2</sup> at low pulse reversal time induced maximum process throughput as 450 nm/min. Increase in either of pulse frequency or pulse reversal time decreased the discharge voltage and plasma density. As a consequence, kinetic energy of ions and ionization of plasma species are sequentially controlled in order to improve the stoichiometry of film and eventually; the electronic transport. The optimization of pulse plasma engineering yields maximum thermoelectric power factor value as 1.35 &times; 10<sup>&minus;4</sup> Wm<sup>&minus;1</sup>K<sup>&minus;2</sup> with process throughput more than 300 nm/min. The obtained values are promising for applications in the automobile and microelectronics industry.
367	Two fold characteristics of Swift Heavy Ion irradiation on Co3O4/RGO nanocomposites	This work presents the dual role exhibited by swift heavy ion irradiation (SHI) on Co3O4 / RGO nanocomposites.  SHI becomes successful in delinking the attached functional groups from RGO thus driving towards its purification. Raman spectra   confirm this result, where, an exponential decrease of the intensity ratio of D and G peaks of RGO with fluence occurs. Simultaneously, SHI generates extended defects or latent tracks in Co3O4 nanoparticles, decorated in RGO nanosheets, thus modifying its magnetic and surface electronic properties. Results obtained from magnetization studies using SQUID magnetometer and surface electronic response from scanning Kelvin probe support the fact.
368	Radiofrequency generation by coherently moving fluxons	A lattice of Abrikosov vortices in type II superconductors is characterized by a periodic modulation of the magnetic induction perpendicular to the applied magnetic field. For a coherent vortex motion under the action of a transport current, the magnetic induction at a given point of the sample varies in time with a washboard frequency <em>f</em><sub>WB</sub>&nbsp;= <em>v</em>/<em>d</em>, where <em>v</em> is the vortex velocity and <em>d</em> is the distance between the vortices in the direction of motion. Here, by using a spectrum analyzer connected to a 50 nm-wide Au nanowire meander near the surface of a superconducting Nb film we detect an ac voltage induced by coherently moving fluxons. The voltage is peaked at the washboard frequency, <em>f</em><sub>WB</sub>, and its subharmonics, <em>f</em><sub>TOF</sub> =&nbsp; <em>f</em><sub>WB</sub>/5, determined by the antenna width. By sweeping the dc current value, we reveal that&nbsp;<em>f</em><sub>WB</sub> can be tuned from 100 MHz to 1.5 GHz, thereby demonstrating that patterned normal metal/superconductor nanostructures can be used as dc-tunable generators operating in the radiofrequency range.
369	Experimental demonstration of the optical Helmholtz resonance	Optical nanoantennas are studied to manipulate light and enhance light matter interactions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the optical Hemholtz resonance in a metallic slit-box structure, which is predicted to behave as an harmonic oscillator and to enhance the electric field intensity by several orders of magnitude.<br />It is fabricated thanks to an electron beam lithography in two steps, between which the box was filled with benzocyclobutene (BCB). Up to 80 % of the light is absorbed at a &#x0015; &lambda;= 2.84 &mu;m wavelength under a beam focused by a Cassegrain objective (NA=0.4), even if the dimensions of this resonator are deeply subwavelength<br />for both the slit (width &#x0015;=&lambda;/55 and height &#x0015;=&lambda;/77) and the box (width &#x0015;=&lambda;/7 and height &#x0015;=&lambda;/37). As expected from the inductance nature of the box, the optical properties of the BCB filling the box have no influence on the resonance behavior.
370	Aerosol jet printed silver nanowire transparent electrode for flexible electronic application	Aerosol jet printing technology enables fine feature deposition of electronic materials onto low-temperature, non-planar substrates without masks. In this work, silver nanowires (AgNWs) are proposed to be printed into transparent flexible electrodes by a Maskless Mesoscale Material Deposition Aerosol Jet&reg; printing system on glass substrate. The influence of the most significant process parameters, including printing cycles, printing speed, and nozzle size on the performance of AgNWs electrode, was systematically studied. The morphologies of printed patterns were characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the transmittance was evaluated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectrophotometer. Under optimum condition, high transparent AgNWs electrodes with sheet resistance of 57.68 &Omega;/sq and linewidth of 50.9 &mu;m were obtained, which is an important step towards a higher performance goal for flexible electronic application.
371	<strong>Photoreduction and Energy Storage performances of Ag<sub>2</sub>O@Ag Deposited on CNT-graphene Nanocomposites </strong>	<strong>&nbsp;</strong>s<p>A simple hydrothermal route assisted by a triblock copolymer was used to synthesize Ag<sub>2</sub>O/Ag nanoparticles on a robotic support consists of functionalized MWCNTs and graphene composite (Ag<sub>2</sub>O/Ag/CNT-graphene). This composite together with the individual analogue Ag/CNT and Ag/graphene were characterized by means of XRD, TEM-SAED, N<sub>2</sub> sorptiometry, Raman, FTIR, UV-Vis, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. These nanomaterials were then tested for the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to the technologically beneficial 4-aminophenol (4-AP). The Ag<sub>2</sub>O@Ag@CNT-graphene composite calcined at 400<sup>o</sup>C has shown fascinating reduction performances for 4-NP either in the dark (<em>k</em>= 0.014 s<sup>-1</sup>) or under visible light illumination (<em>k</em>= 0.039 s<sup>-1</sup>) in the presence of 5 mM NaBH<sub>4</sub> compared to Ag/CNT (0.0112 s<sup>-1</sup>) and Ag/graphene (0.010 s<sup>-1</sup>) catalysts. This was chiefly because Ag<sub>2</sub>O@Ag@CNT-graphene comprises the highest pore volume (0.49 cm<sup>3</sup>/g) and involves three types of pores in the margin from 1.8 to 4.0 nm in front of only one modal type of pores for the rest of the catalysts. The promotion of the p-n junction evaluated using Mott-schottky equation on Ag<sub>2</sub>O@Ag@CNT-graphene assisted by charges separation and surface plasmon resonance bands of Ag and Ag<sub>2</sub>O are found to be advantageous for 4-NP reduction. The latter composite delivers a specific capacitance of 355 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 1.0 A g<sup>-1</sup> exceeding those of Ag/CNT (230 F g<sup>-1</sup>) and Ag/graphene (185 F g<sup>-1</sup>). The EIS study establishes the high electronic conductivity of the metallic Ag and Ag<sub>2</sub>O moieties, low internal resistance of CNT-graphene as well as the marked ionic transfer facilitated by porous nature of the composite.
372	Vortex dynamics over an airfoil controlled by nanosecond pulse discharge plasma actuator	This paper presents the vortex dynamics of flow reattachment on a NASA SC (2)-0712 airfoil by a nanosecond pulse dielectric barrier discharge (NS DBD) actuator at a Reynolds number of 1&times;10<sup>5</sup>. The two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations are solved, and a source term on the right-hand side of the governing fluid energy transport equation is incorporated. The experimental results are well-predicted by computations, where the NS DBD actuator discharge produces a pressure wave with a velocity of 342 m/s and near surface thermal perturbations. Both experimental and computational results indicate that the NS DBD actuator introduces a series of vortexes into the shear layer. In turn, those vortexes promote the mixing of the shear layer, which results in separated flow reattachment. The two-dimensional vorticity evolution equation demonstrates that the vorticity is produced due to the intersection of density and pressure surfaces after plasma discharge. This vorticity advects downstream quickly via local flow velocity. The phase time flow results suggest the mechanism of NS DBD for flow control is the heating effect, which changes the local temperature and density and later induces vortex structures. The vortex structures entrain the outer high-momentum fluid into the shear layer and enhance the turbulent kinetic energy and kinetic energy at the leeward of the wing, thereby strengthening the mixing of the shear layer with the main flow, thereby promoting the separated flow reattachment.
373	<strong>The Physical and Chemical Effects of Increasing Acoustic Power at Small Diameter Ultrasonic Horn Tip</strong>	Ultrasonic horn transducers with small tips apply in most of the laboratories. There are some reports, which has been studied the cavitation dynamics to consider the small tips (approximately is about 3 mm diameter).&nbsp; These reports showed that the high power, attached to the large, stable cavity below the tip and it made too many small bubbles are placed below it, but for lower power, it made the cloud of tiny bubbles. Here, we present a systematic study of the physical and chemical effects at the high &ndash; middle and low power for the 3 mm diameter horn tip. Measurement of the electrical power, calorimetric method, and photography of bubble cloud was done to study the physical effect. KI dosimeter as critical sonochemical reactions. Also synthesized nanoparticles under ultrasonic irradiation consider either the physical and chemical effects are done under variation of acoustic power. For example, the rate of synthesized is chemical effect and adhesive between nanoparticles is the physical effect. The results show that increasing the acoustic power change the physical parameter but cannot change the chemical effect.&nbsp; The comparability of the data measured has been discussed by considering bubble collapse and high-pressure shock wave.
374	The impacts of heat generation/absorption and partial slip on boundary layer flow and heat transfer of a nanofluid comprising of self-impelled motile microorganisms passing a stretching sheet	The present paper has conducted the numerical analysis of a nanofluid consisting of microorganisms on the isothermal linear stretching sheet. The problem has been modeled under the influences of partial slip and heat absorption/generation at the sheet surface. The governing equations are converted to ordinary differential equations through a series of similarity transformations. Using a finite difference method, the resulting equations are discretized, and also they are linearized by applying the linearization technique of Newton. Results of temperature, velocity, concentration of nanoparticles, motile microorganisms' density and also coefficient of reduced skin friction, reduced Nu, reduced Shr, and reduced density numbers of the microorganisms are graphically demonstrated and a detailed description is given. The microorganisms dimensionless density increases as &#x03B4; increase, while decreases with increasing the values of Pe, Lb, Gr and &#x03A9;. Also, boundary layer thickness for motile microorganisms declines by increasing Lb and &#x03A9;. Finally, when the rates of heat generation(&#x03BB;>0) and absorbsion (&#x03BB;<0) increase, the. microorganisms density increases and decreases, respectively.
375	<strong>Dielectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) few-layers WS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets and their tunable electromagnetic absorption properties</strong>	Dielectric property as one of the basic nature of layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), there are a lot of atlas need to be filled-up. In this study, few-layers (FL) WS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets were fabricated through liquid phase exfoliation, and the dielectric and electromagnetic absorption (EA) properties were first reported. The results show that a composite consisting of 30 wt% FL-WS<sub>2</sub> exhibited an effective EA bandwidth (&le;&minus;10 dB, which means 90% electromagnetic energy was attenuated) of 4.6 GHz at a thickness of 2.5 mm. Meanwhile, the strongest absorption point (RL<sub>str</sub>) can reach &minus;63.0 dB. The most noteworthy is that FL-WS<sub>2 </sub>based composite can completely absorb the electromagnetic energy from X (8-12 GHz) and Ku (12-18 GHz) band. These results indicate that FL-WS<sub>2</sub> has practical application against electromagnetic pollution in the future.
376	<strong>Tracing the evolution of individual screw dislocations in nanotwin lamella at the atomic scale</strong>	In situ tension test in a transmission electron microscope was carried out on pure Cu, with the emphasis laid on the dislocation activities in/near nanotwin lamellas. Two dynamic processes were revealed at the atomic scale: (i) a lattice screw dislocation forming by the combination of two twinning dislocations in twin boundary and (ii) two 60&deg; full dislocations evolving from an extended screw dislocation inside nanotwin lamella. Our results provide insights into the role of screw dislocation during deformation in nanotwined metals: it can trigger the transition of dislocation slip mode by its formation and dissociation, and also contribute to the nucleation of non-screw dislocations.
377	Spin-orbit torque induced magnetic vortex polarity reversal utilizing spin-Hall effect	We propose an effective magnetic vortex polarity reversal scheme that makes use of spin-orbit torque introduced by spin-Hall effect in heavy-metal/ferromagnet multilayers structure, which can result in subnanosecond polarity reversal without endanger the structural stability. Micromagnetic simulations are performed to investigate the spin-Hall effect driven dynamics evolution of magnetic vortex. The mechanism of magnetic vortex polarity reversal is uncovered by a quantitative analysis of exchange energy density, magnetostatic energy density, and their total energy density. The simulation results indicate that the magnetic vortex polarity is reversed through the nucleation-annihilation process of topological vortex-antivortex pair. This scheme is an attractive option for ultra-fast magnetic vortex polarity reversal, which can be used as the guidelines for the choice of polarity reversal scheme in vortex-based random access memory.
378	Three-dimensional atomic force microscopy for sidewall imaging using torsional resonance mode	This article presents a three-dimensional atomic force microscopy (3D-AFM) technique for surface and sidewall imaging of nanostructures. We used the vertical resonance mode and torsional resonance mode to measure the top and sidewall topography, respectively. In this configuration, in order to reduce the impact of the tip shape, we used a cantilever with flared tip of 700nm in effective length, and the cantilever is oscillated near its vertical or torsional resonant frequencies by two piezo actuators. To verify the 3D-AFM, we measured a step height standard with perpendicular sidewall about 100nm high. This technique clearly showed the surface and the sidewall.
379	The effect of V/III ratio on the morphology and structure of GaAs nanowires by MOCVD	In this paper, GaAs nanowires with different V/III ratios (70, 140, 280 and 560) were vertically grown from bottom to top on GaAs substrates by using metal organic chemical vapor deposition based on gold assisted vapor-liquid-solid mechanism. It is found that the growth rate of nanowires is inversely proportional to their V/III ratio. And the V/III ratio can also change nanowire growth type. For the nanowire with small V/III ratios (<280), the reactants are most from those atoms merged in the catalyst. But, for the nanowire with V/III ratio 560, the contribution mainly comes from the diffusions of atoms pyrolyzed on the surface of the nanowire and the substrate. A shrunken neck under the catalyst is observed in TEM characterizations. These results will provide a theoretical basis for potential practical applications of nanowire-based devices.
380	Excitation of higher radial modes of azimuthal surface waves in the electron cyclotron frequency range by rotating relativistic flow of electrons in cylindrical waveguides partially filled by plasmas	Azimuthal surface waves are electromagnetic eigenwaves of cylindrical plasma-dielectric waveguides which propagate azimuthally nearby the plasma-dielectric interface across an axial external stationary magnetic field. Their eigenfrequency in particular can belong to the electron cyclotron frequency range. Excitation of azimuthal surface waves by rotating relativistic electron flows was studied in detail recently in the case of the zero-th radial mode for which the waves' radial phase change within the layer where the electrons gyrate is small. In this case just the plasma parameters cause the main influence on the waves' dispersion properties. In the case of the first and higher radial modes, the wave eigenfrequency is higher and the wavelength is shorter than in the case of the zero-th radial mode. This gain being of interest for practical applications can be achieved without any change in the device design. The possibility of effective excitation of the higher order radial modes of azimuthal surface waves is demonstrated here. Getting shorter wavelengths of the excited waves in the case of higher radial modes is shown to be accompanied by decreasing growth rates of the waves. The results obtained here are of interest for developing new sources of electromagnetic radiation, in nano-physics and in medical physics.
381	The effect of droplet size on jet speed in Near-Field Electrospinning	The effect of droplet size on the jet speed in Near-Field Electrospinning has been studied. The droplet size was not considered as a major process parameter in Far-Field Electrospinning because of the large Tip-To-Collector Distance. However, in NFES, where the Tip-to-collector distance is greatly reduced, the change of droplet size significantly alters the local electric field and jet travel distance which is coupled to the acceleration of charged ions in polymer jet. It was revealed that the jet speed is more closely related to the jet travel distance than the electric field in NFES, suggesting that the possibility of precise control of jet speed for microscale patterning of nanofibers.
382	Doubly charged coronene clusters - much smaller than previously observed	The smallest doubly charged coronene cluster ions reported so far, Cor_15^2+, were produced by charge exchange between bare coronene clusters and He^2+ (H. A. B. Johansson et al., Phys. Rev. A 2011, 84, 04320). These dications are at least five times larger than the estimated Rayleigh limit, i.e. the size at which the activation barrier for charge separation vanishes. Such a large discrepancy is unheard of for doubly charged atomic or molecular clusters. Here we report the mass spectrometric observation of doubly charged coronene trimers, produced by electron ionization of helium nanodroplets doped with coronene. The observation implies that Cor_3^2+ features a non-zero fission barrier, consistent with density functional theory calculations that reveal a sizeable barrier for the trimer.
383	<strong>Observation of FeGe Skyrmions by Electron Phase Microscopy with Hole-Free Phase Plate</strong>	We report application of hole-free phase plate (HFPP) to imaging of magnetic skyrmion lattices. Using HFPP imaging, we observed a skyrmions in FeGe, and succeeded in obtaining phase contrast images that reflect the sample magnetization distribution. According to Aharonov-Bohm effect, the electron phase is shifted by the magnetic flux due to sample magnetization. The differential processing of the intensity in a HFPP image allows us to successfully reconstruct the magnetization map of the skyrmion lattice. Furthermore, the calculated phase shift due to the magnetization of the thin film was consistent with that measured by electron holography experiment, which demonstrates that HFPP imaging can be utilized analysis of magnetic fields and electrostatic potential distribution at nanoscale.
384	<strong>Influence of Curvature on the Contact Instabilities of Thin Viscoelastic Coatings on the Fiber Surfaces </strong>	Contact instabilities of a thin viscoelastic film on a curved surface have been explored with the help of a general linear stability analysis. The governing equations and boundary conditions for a thin zero-frequency linear viscoelastic solid film are linearized to predict the time and length scales associated with this instability. A long-wave analysis corroborates the accuracy of the eigenvalues obtained from the general analysis. While the adhesive interaction between the film surface and contactor stimulate contact instability by subduing the restoring elastic and surface tension forces, the forces due to radial curvature fuel up the capillary instability. Importantly, unlike the unconditionally unstable viscous films, this instability manifests beyond a critical destabilizing force owing to its elastic stiffness of the viscoelastic film. The destabilizing intermolecular and radial curvature forces are tuned by controlling the film-contactor gap and radius of fiber, which eventually helped in predicting the formation of drops, columns, or mixed morphologies. For example, when the contactor-film gap is higher and the radius of fiber and the film thickness are lower, the dominant force due to radial curvature can break the film into droplets whereas a smaller contactor-film separation distance on a fiber of large radius instigate contact instability to develop columnar structures. Otherwise, formation of a mixed morphology composed of droplets and columns is expected. The study highlights that tuning film-contactor gap, radius of fiber, and ratio of stabilizing forces, a host of surface patterns with length scales ranging from few micrometers to hundreds of nanometers can be obtained.
385	Defects characterisation studies and exploration of europium substitution effects in nanocrystalline bismuth ferrite through positron annihilation and other methods	A detailed study of the origin and role of structural defects on the effects of Eu<sup>3+</sup>-substitution(<em>x</em> = 0.0, 0.05, &hellip;, 0.3) in place of Bi<sup>3+</sup> in BiFeO<sub>3 </sub>nanocrystalline multiferroic perovskite samples is presented. The samples were synthesized through the normal sol-gel route and characterised by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Further, UV-Vis absorption studies enabled the measurements of the band gap, which showed a continuous decrease on increased substitution. The phenomenon indicated the creation of defects-induced energy levels in the band gap closer to the conduction band. Positron annihilation spectroscopy is used in the identification of the structural defects in the crystallites. The studies revealed high concentrations of trivacancy-type defects within the Bi<sub>1-<em>x</em></sub>Eu<em><sub>x</sub></em>FeO<sub>3</sub>nanocrystallites. The transformation from the distorted rhombohedral structure to an orthorhombic configuration with an accompanying lattice contraction at <em>x</em>&gt; 0.2 influenced the positron lifetimes and the intensities. Substitution also helped in the cancellation of pre-existed vacancies through recombination with the doped ions. The measured positron lifetimes also indicated a fraction of the positrons annihilating from the nanocrystallite surfaces. Coincidence Doppler broadening measurements supported the transformation taking place during the substitution process and further identified the cationic vacancies as the predominant defects. The studies were found justified in the magneto-electric voltage measurements under a.c. magnetic fields of different strengths, all of which peaked at <em>x</em> = 0.2 and then decreased concomitantly with the transformation of the crystallites to the orthorhombic structure.
386	Electrical nanopatterning of TiO<sub>2</sub> single crystal surfaces in situ via local resistance and potential switching.	The resistive switching effect allows for a manipulation of the oxide resistance. Here, we monitor the surface conductivity and surface potential of thermally reduced TiO2 single crystals. We show that the resistance of confined areas can be switched by applying a voltage during scanning. By conducting in situ oxidation experiments, we present that this surface switching is related to a local redox reaction, which can be controlled electrically allowing for surface nanopatterning. We discuss that the features of the nanopattern can be scaled down to a lower boundary at several tens of nanometers determined by the presence of intrinsic variations.
387	A new experimental correlations for heat transfer and flow friction characteristics of the nanofluid flow in transverse with combined protrusion rib square duct	In this paper, forced convective flow of &#x3016;Al&#x3017;_2 O_3-water nanofluid in transverse with combined protrusion rib square duct is experimentally studied. The results of experimental analysis are obtained for Reynolds number (&#x3016;Re&#x3017;_num) ranges of 4000-18000, particle concentration (&#x03C6;) ranges of 0.01-0.04, particle diameter (d_np) ranges of 30nm-45nm,  X-axis pitch (X_axis/d_print) ranges of 1.39-2.59, Y-axis pitch (Y_axis/d_print) ranges of 1.39-2.59 and ratio of print diameter (e_rib/d_print) ranges of 0.83-1.67 respectively. The uppermost value of heat transfer is observed at &#x03C6; of 0.04, d_np of 30nm, X_axis/d_print of 1.79, Y_axis/d_print of 1.79 and e_rib/d_print of 1.0. Nusselt number and flow friction correlations have been developed which can predict the corresponding values of Nusselt number and flow friction with the absolute percentage deviation of 4.82% and 4.53% respectively.
388	Development of Fe3O4/Ag core/shell-based multifunctional immunomagnetic nanoparticles for isolation and detection of CD34+ stem cells	Fe3O4/Ag core/shell nanoparticles functionalized with the free amino (NH2) functional groups (Fe3O4/Ag-NH2) were conjugated with fluorescent ECD-antiCD34 antibody using 1-ethyl-3-(3&#x2032;-dimethyl-aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) catalyst (ECD is a fluorescent organic dye attached to the antibody). The characteristic fluorescence of ECD in the antibody was investigated and used as a good indicator for estimating the percentage of the antibodies that were successfully conjugated with the nanoparticles. Conjugation efficiency was found to increase depending on the VNP:VAB ratio, where VNP and VAB are the volumes of the nanoparticle solution (concentration of 50 ppm) and the as-purchased antibody solution, respectively. The conjugation efficiency rapidly grew up from approximately 18 % to around 70 % when VNP:VAB was increased from 2:1 to 100:1 and gradually reached saturated state at the efficiency of about 95 % as the VNP:VAB equaled 300:1. The bioactivity of the above-mentioned conjugation product (denoted by Fe3O4/Ag-antiCD34) was evaluated in an experiment for collection of stem cells from bone marrow samples.
389	Thermally amorphized nanoporous gold: Morphological and mechanical investigation	In this study, the morphological evolution and mechanical enhancement acquired by applying a thermal treatment on a nanoporous gold are investigated by performing molecular dynamics simulations. The thermal treatment is applied to the structure at the amorphization temperature of the monocrystalline nanoporous gold. To determine the transition temperature to amorphous state, the structure is heated up to 1500 K while monitoring the radial pair distribution functions of the nanoporous structure. Following this, the nanoporous gold is annealed at the amorphization temperature with different heating rates (i.e. 10 and 100K/ps) and durations (i.e. 0, 40 and 100ps). For the purpose of maintaining the amorphous phase in the nanoporous gold, the system is quenched to the room temperature. Then, the mechanical behavior of the thermally treated nanoporous gold is observed by applying tensile and compressive loadings to the structure. The results of the thermally treated nanoporous gold are compared with the non-treated nanoporous gold to determine the mechanical alterations. According to this comparison, the Young&rsquo;s modulus and the ultimate tensile strength of the nanoporous gold are increased by 110% and 80% respectively as a result heat treatment. For compression behavior, owing to heat treatment, the elastic region is improved (i.e. 80 and 10% increased compressive modulus for 10 and 100K/ps, respectively) while the plateau region is shortened which results in early densification.

Of particular interest in controlling electromagnetic losses with enhanced real part of complex permeability and permittivity over the frequency range 2 GHz to 3.43 GHz for antenna applications. Successfully obtained appreciable magnetic and microwave properties due to Sr<sup>2+</sup> substitution for Ba<sup>2+</sup>, in which magnetic moments of Co<sub>2</sub>Z-type hexaferrite lie in the basal plane at room temperature. The larger size crystallites of 52-60 nm range, has a tendency towards multi-domain structure formation, and to decrease the coercivity (Hc) and the magneto-crystalline anisotropy, which in turn increase the real part of permeability (&mu;'). The Maxwell and Wagner type interfacial polarization following the Koop&rsquo;s phenomenological theory, responsible for the&nbsp;variation of the value of permittivity (&epsilon;') with frequency. Several manifestations of electromagnetic studies are reported and explained on the basis of relevant existing theories and models. The desirable results obtained at 2 GHz for composition Ba1.5Sr1.5Co2Fe24O41, are &mu;' = 5 and &#x0510;' = 4.7 with controlled magnetic and electric loss tangents close to zero i.e. 0.003 and 0.006, respectively. The synthesized composite has almost equal values of real permeability and permittivity, as well as the low magnetic and dielectric loss tangents. Such magneto-dielectric substrate material could be valuable for the design of antennas with reduced physical dimensions and good impedance-matched to free space.
391	<strong>Effects of Fretting Interfaces&rsquo; Characteristics on Friction Behavior: Molecular Dynamics Simulation and Theoretical Analysis</strong>	The friction behavior between fretting interfaces is not only of fundamental interest, but also practically important in materials&rsquo; utilities. However, current discussion about the fretting process never investigates into friction contact intervals. Moreover, the fretting process has not been understood systematically from the perspective of different interfacial configuration, and has failed to consider rapidly developing theories in energy, mechanics, etc. In the present work, by performing Molecular Dynamics Simulations on the Al-Al, diamond-diamond, and diamond-silicon fretting interfaces using the bidirectional forces, referring to the novel theories including the energy barrier theory, bonding principles, wear rate analyses, and nanoscale friction laws, we found that the difference in hardness and the material&rsquo;s configuration greatly influence the force response, which leads to force responses during the friction contact intervals, and give different coefficient of friction to the researched interfaces. Due to the possible prominent force responses during the contact intervals, the continuous friction behavior on fretting interfaces must take into consideration the role played by intervals, in order to form a complete discussion, to more accurately estimate friction coefficient, and to correctly relate MD simulation with experiments.
392	<strong>Solution Processable Cd<sub>1&minus;&#x1D465;</sub>Zn<sub>&#x1D465;</sub>S with Controlled Band gap and its Visible Light Photocatalytic Tetracycline Degradation Activity</strong>	Photocatalytic degradation of broad band antibiotics like Tetracycline (TC) under visible-light irradiation is considered as an efficient and cost effective protocol for eliminating it from the aqueous medium. In this study, highly efficient solution processable Cd<sub>1&minus;&#x1D465;</sub>Zn<sub>&#x1D465;</sub>S photocatalysts were synthesized using simple solvothermal route where zinc acetate and cadmium acetate were used as precursors. Composition-tunable alloyed nanorods with band gap energy tunability ranging from UV (3.7eV) to Vis (2.5ev) are characterized both structurally and optically. The photocatalytic performance is strongly related with the ratio of Cd and Zn present in Cd<sub>1&minus;&#x1D465;</sub>Zn<sub>&#x1D465;</sub>S nanorod. The Cd<sub>0.75</sub>Zn<sub>0.25</sub>S sample exhibits the highest photocatalytic degradation rate constant compared to the other family members. Our study gives new insight towards the designing of ternary photocatalytic materials for efficient removal of antibiotics from aqueous solution.
393	Dynamic formation of nanodiamond precursors from the decomposition of carbon suboxide (C<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in extreme conditions - a ReaxFF study	We use Molecular Dynamics simulations with the ReaxFF-lg potential to model the high pressure pyrolysis of carbon suboxide (C<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in mixture with argon as pressure bath. We show that the reactive simulations catch the experimental behavior of the low-pressure detonation of C<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (around 10 bar in shock tube experiments) and allows extrapolations to the high-pressure range of solid-state explosive detonation (up to 60 GPa). While at low pressure carbon-based nanostructures are formed through aggregation of species such as carbon dimers C<sub>2</sub>, it appears that the high pressure deeply modifies the process, with aggregation of growing C<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub> heterostructures, in which the oxygen amount is driven by the pressure and the temperature. Pressures in the order of 60 GPa lead to high oxygen ratios which hinder <i>sp<sup>3</sup></i>-hybridization of carbon. But a pressure lowering leads to substantial carbon enrichment through CO<sub>2</sub>/CO release, which consequently facilitates the formation of <i>sp<sup>3</sup></i> carbon phases, allowing in turn the formation of carbon-based nanoparticles with well-formed diamond cores. These results give new insights on the conditions leading to nanodiamonds during the detonation of carbon-rich high explosives.
394	<strong>The effects of annealing temperature on the permittivity and electromagnetic attenuation performance of reduced graphene oxide</strong>	Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) has been prepared through thermal reduction method with different annealing temperature, to explore the effects on the permittivity, as well as electromagnetic attenuation performance. The real and imaginary part of permittivity increase along with the decrement of oxygen functional group and the increment of the filler loading ratio. A composite only loaded with 1 wt% of RGO can possess an effective electromagnetic absorption (EA) bandwidth of 7.60 GHz, when graphene oxide (GO) was reduced under 300 <sup>&deg;</sup>C for 2 h. With the annealing temperature increased to 700 <sup>&deg;</sup>C, the well reduced RGO loaded 7 wt% in the composite, the electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding efficiency (SE) can get higher than 35 dB from 2 to 18 GHz. This study shows that controlling the oxygen functional groups on RGO surface, can also obtain an ideal electromagnetic protective performance without any other decorated nanomaterials.
395	Low-voltage all-inorganic perovskite quantum dot transistor memory	An all-inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite QDs based Au NPs floating-gate memories with solution processed layer-bylayer (LBL) method is demonstrated. Easy synthesis at room temperature and excellent stability makes all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots (QDs) suitable as semiconductor layer in low voltage nonvolatile transistor memory. The bipolarity of QDs have both electrons and holes stored in the Au nanoparticles (NPs) floating gate, resulting in bidirectional shifts of initial threshold voltage according to the applied programing and erasing pulses. Under low operation voltage (&plusmn;5 V), the memory achieved great memory window (~2.4 V), long retention time (&gt; 10<sup>5</sup> s) and stable endurance property after 200 cycles. So, the proposed memory device based on CsPbBr3 perovskite QDs has a great potential in the flash memory market.
396	Optical design of GaN nanowire arrays for photocatalytic applications	GaN nanowire (NW) arrays are interesting candidates for photocatalytic applications due to their high surface-to-volume ratio and their waveguide character. The integration of GaN NW arrays on GaN-based light emitting diodes (LEDs), serving as platform for electrically driven NW-based photocatalytic devices, enables an efficient coupling of the light from the planar LED to the GaN NWs. Here, we present a numerical study of the influence of the NW geometries, i.e. the NW diameter, length and period, and the illumination wavelength on the transmission of GaN NW arrays on transparent substrates. A detailed numerical analysis reveals that the transmission characteristics for large periods are determined by the waveguide character of the single NW, whereas for dense GaN NW arrays inter-wire coupling and diffraction effects originating from the periodic arrangement of the GaN NWs dominate the transmission. The numerically simulated results are confirmed by experimental transmission measurements. We also investigate the influence of a dielectric NW shell and of the surrounding medium on the transmission characteristics of a GaN NW array.
397	<strong>Waterproof and stretchable tirboelectric nanogenerator for biomechanical energy harvesting and self-powered sensing</strong>	We introduce a waterproof and stretchable triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) that can be attached on human body, such as finger and wrist, to harvest mechanical energies from body movement. The whole device is composed of stretchable material so that it can endure and scavenge energy from diverse mechanical deformations. Under the gentle mechanical motion of press, stretch and bend, the device with an effective area of 1 &nbsp;2 cm can generate peak-to-peak output current of 257.5 nA, 50.2 nA and 33.5 nA, respectively. Besides, the TENG is tightly encapsulated which can avoid the influence from external environment like humidity and enable it to harvest energy under water. Particularly, owing to the thin and soft property of encapsulation film, the device can response to weak vibration like wrist pulse and act as a self-powered pulse sensor, showing &nbsp;its application prospects in the field of wearable energy harvesting devices and self-powered sensing system.
398	<strong>A novel model for the mechanical properties of silica aerogels</strong>	Most studies on the mechanical properties of silica aerogels neglected the influence of structural randomness and the dead-ends of nano-porous materials, whereas both of them have a considerable effect on the mechanical properties of silica aerogels. In this study, we propose a cubic frame model with random orientation as the representative volume element (RVE) of silica aerogel to investigate the dead-ends&rsquo; effect on its mechanical properties. To characterize the structural randomness in the open-cell porous materials, a new constitutive model is established by a statistically average of the mechanical response of the random structure. This constitutive model reveals the inherent isotropy of open-cell porous materials. It also indicates the widely-used Gibson-Ashby model may overestimate the Young&rsquo;s modulus and shear modulus for open-cell porous materials. Then the mass ratio of dead-ends and effective skeleton are derived using available experimental results. It shows that the mass ratio of dead-ends increases with the decreasing density of silica aerogels because of the more space resulted from slimmer effective skeleton, which results in the abnormal exponent of the Young&rsquo;s modulus-density power-law relation. We suggest the mass ratio of the effective skeleton to be an intuitive and practical index to reflect the connectivity in silica aerogels. Besides, the dead-ends can significantly enhance the compressive strength of silica aerogels, especially for low-density silica aerogels. We hope this work can provide a new idea to consider the structural randomness in porous materials and give guidance on the mechanical reinforcement of aerogels.
399	Probing flexoelectricity via a split Hopkinson pressure bar experiment	Flexoelectricity is thought of as a universal property of all dielectric materials that couples polarization with the inhomogeneous deformation. However, at the macroscale, this coupling is usually very weak and the direct observation of flexoelectricity always suffers by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). At the micron or submicron scale, both the flexoelectric effect and some surface effects may get pronounced simultaneously. To separate the flexoelectric effect from those surface effects and accurately measure the bulk flexoelectric coefficients is challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel high SNR method for measuring the bulk flexoelectric coefficient &nbsp;of millimeter-sized samples through split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) experiments. Our experimental results show that for normal impact speed (17m/s) of the striker bar, the induced voltage difference is as high as 70mV which can be easily measured without using signal amplifiers. In most of previous works of measuring flexoelectric coefficients, strain gradients are introduced through the design of samples&rsquo; shape such as thin beams, thin films, truncated cones and pyramids. In a different way, the proposed SHPB based approach introduces time varied strains to the system and then converts time gradients of strains into their spatial gradients through elastic waves. As a promising way of measuring bulk flexoelectric coefficients, this approach produces high SNR flexoelectric signals, reduces the interferences from surface effects, and avoids the difficulties in fabricating nanostructures.
400	<strong>Enhancement of coalescence-induced droplet jumping on superhydrophobic surfaces</strong>	Coalescence-induced droplet self-jumping on superhydrophobic surfaces has received extensive attentions over the past decade because of its potential applications ranging from anti-icing materials to self-sustained condensers, and a higher jumping velocity <em>v</em><sub>j</sub> is always expected and favorable. However, the previous studies have shown that there is a velocity limit with <em>v</em><sub>j</sub>&le;0.23<em>u</em><sub>ic</sub> for microscale droplets and <em>v</em><sub>j</sub>&le;0.127<em>u</em><sub>ic</sub> for nanoscale droplets, where <em>u</em><sub>ic</sub> is referred to as the inertial-capillary velocity. Here we show that the jumping velocity can be significantly increased by patterning a single groove, ridge, or more hydrophobic strip, whose size is comparable with the radius of coalescing droplets, on a superhydrophobic surface. We implement molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the coalescence of two equally sized nanodroplets (8 nm in radius) on such surfaces. We found that a maximum <em>v</em><sub>j</sub>=0.23<em>u</em><sub>ic</sub> is achieved on the surface with a 1.4 nm high and 8 nm wide ridge, which is 1.81 times higher than the nanoscale velocity limit. We also demonstrate that the presence of groove, ridge, and strip alters coalescence dynamics of droplets, leading to a significantly shortened coalescence time which remarkably reduces viscous dissipation during coalescence; thus, we believe that the present approach is effective for microscale droplet jumping.
401	<strong>Flexible pressure sensor based on graphene aerogel functionalized with CdS nanocrystalline thin film</strong>	In this paper, we report on functionalization of graphene aerogel with a CdS thin film deposited by magnetron sputtering and on the development of flexible pressure sensors based on ultra-lightweight CdS-aerogel nanocomposite. Analysis by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis discloses the uniform deposition of nanocrystalline CdS films with the chemical composition deviating from the ideal stoichiometry by 3.4 %. The piezoresistive response of the aforementioned nanocomposite in the pressure range from 1 to 5 atm is found to be more than one order of magnitude higher than that inherent to suspended graphene membranes, leading to an average sensitivity as high as 3.2x10<sup>-4</sup> kPa<sup>-1</sup>.
402	Evolution and tailoring of DUV plasmonic properties in Al nanoparticle arrays by UV irradiation	UV irradiation was used to tailor the surface plasmon band of the densely distributed Al nanoparticle arrays fabricated by gas phase deposition. We showed that the broad surface plasmon resonance band of the as-prepared sample could be tuned to a sharp and strong resonance band in the DUV optical range, with a large blue shift of the peak wavelength. The evolution of the surface plasmon resonance properties was attributed to the UV irradiation-improved surface oxidation of the nanoparticles, which vanished the nearfield couplings between the closely spaced nanoparticles by increasing their interspacing.
403	Atomistic Minimal Model for Estimating Profile of Electrodeposited Nanopatterns	We develop a computationally efficient and methodologically simple approach to realize molecular dynamics simulations of electrodeposition. Our minimal model takes into account the nontrivial electric field due a sharp electrode tip to perform simulation of the controllable coating of a thin layer on a surface with an atomic precision. On the atomic scale a highly site-selective electrodeposition of ions and charged particles by means of the sharp tip of a scanning probe microscope is possible. A better understanding of the microscopic process, obtained mainly from atomistic simulations, helps us to enhance the quality of this nanopatterning technique and to make it applicable in fabrication of nanowires and nanocontacts. In the limit of screened inter-particle interactions, it is feasible to run very fast simulations of the electrodeposition process within the framework of the proposed model and thus to investigate how the shape of the overlayer depends on the tip-sample geometry and dielectric properties, electrolyte viscosity, etc. Our calculations results reveal that the sharpness of the profile of a nano-scale deposited overlayer is dictated by the normal-to-sample surface component of the electric field underneath the tip.
404	Study on the energy deposition and ignition characteristics of a capillary discharge based pulsed plasma thruster	Ablative pulsed plasma thrusters (APPTs) have aroused renewed interest in the investigation and enhancement of the basic performance for the application of micro/nano satellites recently. However, since the complex working mechanism and limited energy deposition efficiency, research on the characteristics of energy deposition and ignition process is critical to the optimization of the APPT design under a low energy level. In this paper, a capillary discharge based PPT is presented and the influence of the electric and geometry parameters on the characteristics are studied by experiments. Two stages are observed in the entire energy deposition process according to the variation of the deposition rate. The promotion of the energy deposition efficiency can be accomplished with the limitation of the main discharge current oscillations by increasing the main capacitance at a fixed energy and the cavity length or decreasing the main charging voltage and cavity inner diameter, which is in accordance with the variation of the equivalent plasma resistance. Shorter ignition delay time and lower jitter are obtained with a higher ignition energy and main charging voltage or a shorter and narrower cavity, which is positively correlated to the electric field distribution along the propellant surface. The accumulation of ablated products and variation of the surface morphology of propellant and igniter are the significant factors that cause the dispersity of the ignition effect and main discharge characteristics with increasing the operation times. Meanwhile, noticeable mal-distribution of the ablation/deposition phenomena in the axial direction of the propellant surface are verified.
405	Evolution of filaments and associated magnetic fields produced by the Weibel Instability in two counterstreaming laser plasmas	The evolution of filaments due to the Weibel instability was studied experimentally in two counterstreaming plasmas produced by nanosecond laser pulses with total energy more than 1 kJ. The magnetic field around filamentations was diagnosed by the Faraday rotation technique as tens of Tesla with an exponential growth rate of 10^-6, which was in good agreement with the calculated features of the Weibel Instability. The separation distances between filaments were also measured, and its temporal evolution, as compared to analytical models from Medvedev [Astrophys. J. 618, L75-L78 (2005)] and Ruyer [Phys. Plasmas 22 032102 (2015).], was mostly attributed to the coalescence behavior of filaments in post saturation regime.
406	Density-functional study of hydrogen cyanide adsorption on silicene nanoribbons	Adsorption of toxic hydrogen cyanide gas (HCN) on armchair silicene nanoribbons (ASiNRs) is investigated by first principles method using density functional theory (DFT) to compute geometric, electronic and transport properties. Two variants of ASiNRs are considered: pristine ASiNR (P-ASiNR) and defective ASiNR (D-ASiNR), which is created by introducing a vacancy in P-ASiNR by removal of a Si atom. Total energy optimizations are used to find the most stable structures. The calculated results reveal that although HCN is physisorbed in both variants, sensitivity in case of D-ASiNR is sufficiently enhanced owing to more adsorption energy and charge transfer between the ASiNR-gas complex. Also the inspection of current-voltage characteristics demonstrates that the introduction of defect has considerably increased the conductivity of ASiNR. Hence, D-ASiNR may be used as a promising sensor for HCN gas.
407	Dielectric properties and out of plane Magnetic anisotropy of electrodeposited Co<sub>1-X</sub>Mn<sub>X </sub>alloy nanowires	The Co<sub>1-x</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub> alloy nanowires with uniform size and high density have been prepared by AC electrodeposition method into the anodized aluminum oxide AAO templates by using the different AC potential from 9 V to 13 V. A systematic study has been done about the voltage dependent physical and magnetic properties of CoMn nanowires. The Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) shows that the concentration of Mn and Cobalt increases and decreases respectively with the increase of voltage. It is observed from X-ray Diffraction (XRD) data of all samples that CoMn alloy nanowires have the cubic structure and crystallite size varies from 39.63 nm to 48.96 nm. The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) pattern shows the presence of other materials such as CoO, MnO, and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>at different wavenumber range. The dielectric properties decrease with the increase of voltage due to incorporation of Mn ions and deduction of Co ions. The decrease in AC conductivity against the increasing voltage is also due to the increase of grain boundary volume. The M-H loops were measured by using the vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and show the anisotropic and ferromagnetic behavior. When AC potential increases gradually from 9 V to 13 V in equal intervals, the deposition of magnetic ion decreases than that of nonmagnetic ions, as a consequence coercivity (H<sub>C</sub>) and saturation magnetization (M<sub>S</sub>) decreases. It is also found that magnetization reversal has nucleation mode and squareness decreases with increase of angle.&nbsp; This study is useful to modify properties according to our desire.

409	Thermal Conductivity of Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) Films Engineered by oxidative Chemical Vapor Deposition (oCVD)	Oxidative chemical vapor deposition (oCVD) is a versatile technique that can simultaneously tailor properties (e.g., electrical, thermal conductivity) and morphology of polymer films at the nanoscale. In this work, we report the thermal conductivity of nanoscale oCVD grown poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) films for the first time. Measurements as low as 0.16 W/m&middot;K are obtained at room temperature for PEDOT films with thicknesses ranging from 50 - 100 nm. These values are lower than those for solution processed PEDOT films doped with the solubilizing agent PSS (polystyrene sulfonate). The thermal conductivity of oCVD grown PEDOT films shows no clear dependence on electrical conductivity, which ranges from 1 S/cm to 30 S/cm. It is suspected that at these electrical conductivities, the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity is extremely small and that phonon transport is dominant. Our findings suggest that CVD polymerization is a promising route towards engineering polymer films that combine low thermal conductivity with relatively high electrical conductivity values.
410	Free energy of adhesion of lipid bilayers on silica surfaces	The free energy of adhesion per unit area (hereafter referred to as the adhesion strength) of lipid arrays on surfaces is a key parameter that determines the nature of the interaction between materials and biological systems. Here we report classical molecular simulations of water and DMPC lipid bilayers at model silica surfaces with a range of silanol densities and structures. We employ a novel technique that enables us to estimate the adhesion strength of supported lipid bilayers in the presence of water. We find that silanols on the silica surface form hydrogen bonds with water molecules and that the water immersion enthalpy for all surfaces varies linearly with the surface density of these hydrogen bonds. The adhesion strength of lipid bilayers is a linear function of the surface density of hydrogen bonds formed between silanols and the lipid molecules on crystalline surfaces. Roughly 20% of isolated silanols form such bonds but less than 1% of mutually interacting geminal silanols. On amorphous silica the bilayer displays much stronger adhesion than expected from the crystalline surface data. We discuss the implications of these results for nanoparticle toxicity.
411	Vibration-induced structures in scanning tunneling microscope light emission spectra of Ni(110)-(2 &times; 1) O	We obtained scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) light emission spectra of a Ni(110)-(2 &times; 1) O surface. A mosaic of nanoscale light and dark domains was observed in the STM image. When the tip was fixed over the dark domain, stepwise structures were observed at 100 meV and 150 meV below the quantum cutoff in the STM light emission spectra. These energies were consistent with the reported vibrational energies of oxygen atoms adsorbed on the Ni(110)-(2 &times; 1) O surface, and indicated the expected isotope shifts between <sup>16</sup>O and <sup>18</sup>O. Therefore, these stepwise structures are induced by the vibrations of adsorbed oxygen atoms. The 100-meV mode corresponded to the vibration polarized parallel to the surface. A theory describing the coupling between the STM light emission and vibration polarized parallel to the surface is proposed. We conclude that the oxygen atoms cover the dark domain and bare Ni atoms correspond to the light domain. When the exposure level of oxygen was approximately 1/10 of that for Ni(110)-(2 &times; 1) O, light-imaged nanostructures were observed in the terrace where bare Ni atoms are exposed. The step structure caused by the vibrations of adsorbed oxygen was observed in the STM light emission spectra of the light-imaged nanostructures, showing that these structures are covered by oxygen atoms. In other words, the isolated nanostructures covered by oxygen atoms are imaged not as dark, but as light, unlike in the case of Ni(110)-(2 &times; 1) O observed by STM.
412	Low temperature-processed ZnO nanorods-TiO2 nanoparticles composite as electron transporting layer for perovskite solar cells	Electron transport is one of the most crucial processes that determine charge collection efficiency in perovskite solar cells. Herein, a low temperature-processed ZnO-TiO2 nanocomposite is developed as an electron transporting layer for perovskite solar cells. Highly-crystalline ZnO nanorods were deposited electrochemically which served as the scaffold for spin-coated TiO2 nanoparticles. This ZnO-TiO2 nanocomposite is designed to integrate the fast electron transport along the nanorods and the additional surface area provided by the nanoparticles for enhanced electronic contact between the electron-transporting layer and the perovskite layer. A weak PL quenching behavior was observed for ZnO nanorods after TiO2 nanoparticle coating which signifies a reduction in ZnO surface defects. Steady-state photoluminescence and optical absorption measurements indicated improved charge transfer and higher absorption of light, respectively, when ZnO-TiO2 nanocomposite is contacted with the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. However, the clustering of the nanoparticles caused inefficient charge transfer from TiO2 to ZnO.
413	Non-local electron transport through normal and topological ladder-like atomic systems.	We propose locally protected ladder-like atomic system (nanoconductor) on a substrate that is insensitive to external perturbations. The system corresponds to coupled atomic chains fabricated on different surfaces.&nbsp; Electron transport properties of such conductors are studied theoretically using the model tight-binging Su-Schriffer-Hegger (SSH) Hamiltonian and Green's function formalism. We have found that the conductance of the system is almost insensitive to single impurities and oscillates as a function of the impurity chain length with very large periods and the oscillation amplitude depends on the electron localization in the surface. Non-local character of the electron transport was observed also for topological SSH chains where nontrivial end states survive in the presence of disturbances as well as for different substrates.&nbsp; We have found that the careful inspection of the density of states (DOS) or charge&nbsp; waves can provide the information about the atoms energy levels and hopping amplitudes. Moreover, the ladder-like geometry allows one to distinguish between normal and topological zero-energy states. It is important that topological chains do not reveal Friedel oscillations which are observed in non-topological chains.
414	Critical Thickness for Spin Wave-Assisted Switching of Magnetization in a Perpendicularly Magnetized Nanomagnet	The magnetization switching in a perpendicularly magnetized nano magnet by applying circularly polarized rf field is analyzed as a function of the thickness (<em>d</em>) of the specimen using an effective one-dimensional model. It is found that there exist two kinds of critical thicknesses, <em>d</em><sub>c1</sub> and <em>d</em><sub>c2</sub>(&ge; <em>d</em><sub>c1</sub>). When <em>d</em> &lt; <em>d</em><sub>c1</sub>, the switching mode is an uniform type which is well described by a macro-spin model. On the other hand, when d<sub>c1</sub> &le;&nbsp;<em>d</em> &lt;&nbsp;<em>d</em><sub>c2</sub>, the switching mode is a non-uniform type whereas the rf frequency dependence of the switching field is the same as the one with <em>d</em> &nbsp;&lt; <em>d</em><sub>c1</sub>. In the case of <em>d</em> &ge; <em>d</em><sub>c2</sub>, the critical rf frequency at which the switching field takes a minimum value increases. The results indicate that the switching field is more effectively reduced than the conventional microwave-assisted switching.
415	<strong>Van der Waals Epitaxy of Two-Dimensional Single-Layer h-BN on Graphite by Molecular Beam Epitaxy:</strong><strong> Electronic Properties and Band Structure</strong>	Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a promising material for implementation in nanoelectronics due to a large band gap, low spin-orbit coupling, and a small lattice mismatch to graphene. We report on the controlled growth of&nbsp;h-BN/graphite by means of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggests an interface without any reaction or intermixing, while the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements show that the h-BN layers are epitaxially aligned with graphite. A well-defined band structure is revealed by ARPES measurement, reflecting the high quality of the h-BN films. The measured valence band maximum (VBM) located at 2.8 eV below the Fermi level reveals the presence of undoped h-BN films (band gap ~ 6 eV). These results demonstrate that, although only weak van der Waals interactions are present between h-BN and graphite, a long range ordering of h-BN can be obtained even on polycrystalline graphite <em>via</em> van der Waals epitaxy, offering the prospect of large area, single layer h-BN.
416	<strong>Development of compact urea biosensor using printed circuit board technology </strong>	This paper presents fabrication of compact and low cost printed circuit board (PCB) based urea biosensor using a circular sized indium tinoxide (ITO) coated glass as working electrode. For this, ITO coated glass was subjected to etching using 50 % concentrated sulphuric acid and keeping a temperature of 50 &#x02DA;C with a suitable mask to protect the circuit area. &nbsp;A silver layer was developed around the ITO working electrode on the same glass by thermal evaporation technique and then AgCl paste was coated on the Ag layer for the preparation of Ag/AgCl reference electrode. A thin layer of mixture of nanostructured copper oxide (Nano-CuO) and nanostructured zinc oxide (Nano-ZnO) was deposited using electrophoretic deposition method on the said working electrode. Urease (Enzyme) was immobilized on the working electrode surface by physical adsorption technique via glutareldehyde as cross-linker. Electrochemical response of this urea bioelectrode was recorded by Keithley Source Meter (KSM) for different urea concentration from 0.1 to 100 mM. This Nano-CuO/Nano-ZnO urea bioelectrode was found to have sensitivity of 488 uA/mM/cm<sup>2</sup>, shelf life of 180 days under normal laboratory condition and lower limit of detection of 35 uM. This method requires only a small amount of urease~ 2 &micro;l and no extra buffer saline for test. Such small sized nanostructured urea biosensor with high commercial impact can be easily fabricated and mass produced using this methodology.
417	Temperature dependence of photoinduced hydrogen production and simultaneous separation in TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes/palladium bilayer membrane	Temperature dependence of photoinduced hydrogen production and simultaneous separation was examined in a bilayer membrane comprised by an anodized TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotube arrays (TNAs) and a palladium layer. This membrane was fabricated by transferring a TNA embedded in a titanium sheet onto an electroless-plated palladium film. Sacrificial water splitting with methanol was photocatalytically performed under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and only generated hydrogen gas was concurrently separated with the Pd layer. The H<sub>2</sub> production rate (r<sub>H2</sub>) with the membrane at various temperatures was evaluated by using a home-made characterization system. The measured r<sub>H2</sub> showed larger values at higher temperature of the membrane and increased abruptly after several hours of UV irradiation. This inflection behavior appeared earlier at higher temperature of the membrane, which can be related to the permeation and adsorption characteristics of hydrogen in the Pd layer.
418	The influence of alkali metals interaction with Al/P-substituted BN nanosheets on their electronic and nonlinear optical properties: A DFT theoretical study	On the basis of the boron nitride (BN) nanosheet, the alkali-doped Al-M, Al-M&#x2032;, P-M, and P-M&#x2032; (M, M&#x2032; = Li, Na, K) electrides were designed to investigate how the dopants affect the nonlinear optical responses. The Al-M, Al-M&#x2032;, P-M, and P-M&#x2032; are obtained by doping an alkali metal atom into the corresponding Al/P-substituted BN nanosheet. The molecular orbital and density of states analysis revealed that doping the alkali metal atoms can significantly narrow the energy gaps of undoped systems, which is mainly attributed to the new high HOMO energy level containing the excess electron. Further, the loosely bound excess electron from alkali metal atom brings the considerable first hyperpolarizabilities (&#x03B2;0) to these doped systems, especially, the P-K&#x2032;possesses the largest &#x03B2;0 value of 70677 au. In addition, the &#x03B2;0 values of novel nanostructures are influenced by both the substitution effect and the doping position of the alkali metals. The further investigations show that transition energy is the decisive factor for the &#x03B2;0 value of the electride. TD-DFT calculations are performed to investigate the effect of alkali metal doping on absorption spectrum. Bathochromic shift is observed in the UV-vis spectrum of all doped systems. We hope that this study could expand the potential application of the BN-based nanosystems in the high-performance nonlinear optical materials.
419	<strong>S</strong><strong>i-core/SiGe-shell channel nanowire field-effect transistor for sub-10-nm logic technology in the THz regime</strong>	Nanowire <em>p</em>-type field-effect transistor (FET) having a SiGe shell channel on a Si core for sub-10-nm advanced logic technology is optimally designed and characterized using in-depth technology computer-aided design (TCAD) with quantum models. SiGe is adopted as the material for the ultra-thin shell channel owing to its two primary merits of high hole mobility and strong Si compatibility. The SiGe shell can effectively confine the hole by the large valence-band offset (VBO) between the Si core and SiGe channel arranged in the radial direction. To obtain simulation results with higher accuracy and credibility, the carriers&rsquo; electrical characteristic modeling and energy-band parameter engineering are carried out in the channel at different Ge fractions. Based on this approach, the proposed device is optimized in terms of the Ge shell channel thickness, Ge fraction in the SiGe channel, and channel length (<em>L</em><sub>g</sub>), by examining a set of primary DC parameters. In addition, radio-frequency (RF) parameters are investigated at sub-10-nm <em>L</em><sub>g</sub>. The cut-off frequency (<em>f</em><sub>T</sub>) and maximum oscillation frequency (<em>f</em><sub>max</sub>) of the proposed device when <em>L</em><sub>g</sub> is 5 nm are found to be 440.0 GHz and 753.9 GHz, respectively, with an intrinsic delay time (<em>&tau;</em>) of 3.14 ps. The proposed SiGe-shell-channel nanowire <em>p</em>-type FET demonstrates good potential for low-power and high-speed applications in 10-nm-and-beyond complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology.
420	Effects of doping on photoelectrical properties of one-dimensional &#x03B1;-Si3N4 nanomaterials: a first-principles study	The structural stability, electronic and optical properties of Al-, Y-, O-doped and Al-O-codoped one-dimensional (1D) &#x03B1;-Si3N4 nanomaterials are investigated by first-principles methods. All dopants prefer to locate at the surface of 1D &#x03B1;-Si3N4 nanomaterials except Al. The doping difficulties decrease in the order of AlSi, YSi, ON and AlSi-ON. The conduction types and band gap values of 1D &#x03B1;-Si3N4 nanomaterials are tunable by doping due to the hybridizations of impurity states with the band edges. The increases of hole and electron effective masses caused by doping are different. The doping greatly affects the optical properties of 1D &#x03B1;-Si3N4 nanomaterials mainly at and below the absorption edges. The optical parameters in the parallel direction to the axis are larger than those in the perpendicular direction. Especially if the nanomaterial was doped with Al, its optical parameters are changed most obviously, followed by those of Y-doped nanomaterial, while the differences of the O-doped and Al-O-codoped nanomaterials are not obvious.
421	<strong>Studies on Jahn-Teller distortion and magnetic transitions in GdMn<sub>1-x</sub>Fe<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>(x= 0, 0.1, 0.2) Nanoparticles</strong>	GdMnO<sub>3</sub> perovskite compounds demonstrate para to incommensurate anti-ferromagnetic transition at 42 K (T<sub>N</sub>), an incommensurate to A type antiferromagnetic at 22 K and finally show a weak ferromagnetic behavior at 6 K. In this report, the evolution of structure and the rich sequence of magnetic transitions in GdMnO<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles synthesized through sol-gel technique have been studied after incorporating magnetic ions like Iron. GdMn<sub>1-x</sub>Fe<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3&nbsp;</sub>(x= 0, 0.1 and 0.2) show pure phase, orthorhombic structure with Pbnm space group with size ranging from 35 to 45 nm. Rietveld refinement of X-ray powder diffraction data reveals that while lattice parameters, a and b contract, the lattice parameter, c, shows an expansion with increase in Fe concentration which confirms the O' type orthorhombic structure. We observe a decrease in J-T distortion factor with increase in Fe concentration. Decrease in Jahn-Teller (J-T) distortion further corroborates with the decrease in intensity of asymmetric stretching bond observed at 487 cm<sup>-1</sup> from Raman measurement. The lattice parameter contraction is attributed to the presence of Mn<sup>4+</sup> accompanied with increase in oxygen vacancies confirmed from XPS and EXAFS analysis. The temperature dependent magnetization while show an increase in T<sub>N</sub> from 25 K at x= 0 to 36 K at x= 0.2, the magnetic transitions at 11 and 5 K does not show significant change with Fe doping. Spin dynamics of GdMn<sub>1-x</sub>Fe<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3&nbsp;</sub>(x= 0, 0.1 and 0.2) are discussed using the phenomenological models like Neel-Arrhenius, Vogel-Fulcher and Power law.
422	Reaction of N,N'-dimethylformamide and divalent viologen molecule to generate an organic dopant for molybdenum disulfide	Carrier doping of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) is of fundamental importance for enabling a wide range of atomically-thin optoelectronic devices. So far, a surface charge transfer doping is a successful strategy to dope TMDC, HOWEVER, the dopants for the method is very FEW. Here, we developed a new general strategy for preparing a dopant with viologen moiety in a common solvent, N,N'-dimethylformamide. The synthesized molecule was found to act as a dopant for MoS2 by applying a MOSFET structure. This work should be wide interest to the readers in materials science, chemistry and nanoelectronics of APL Materials.
423	A multiscale approach for percolation transition using a nucleation and growth model and its application to cement setting	Percolation is commonly observed phenomenon in nature, where a spanning cluster is formed by linking neighboring sites. Studies to estimate the percolation threshold are generally prone to finite size effects. Here, a dynamic multi-scale model virtually free from finite size effects is presented, considering cement setting as an example of off-lattice uncorrelated bond percolation. A statistical approach is developed, where a nano colloidal kinetic Monte Carlo nucleation and growth algorithm describes the formation of hydration products. The model unveils the crucial role of hydration product nano texture on the degree of hydration at setting and explain why it remains largely unaffected under general usage conditions. Our ex-professo experiments afterwards confirms these predictions
424	<strong>Mg <em>vs.</em> Oxygen vacancy in boosting high temperature ferromagnetism in MgO nanocrystallite: An experimental and DFT based study</strong>	Oxygen vacancies are considered responsible for the room temperature ferromagnetism in transition metal oxide (TMOs) systems. In contrast, ferromagnetism in MgO nanocrystallite is regulated by the presence of Mg vacancies. Herein, this conclusion is realized by us both experimentally as well as through density functional theoretical (DFT) calculation.&nbsp; MgO nanocrystallite is grown in at 500 <sup>0</sup>C, 650 <sup>0</sup>C and 800 <sup>0</sup>C under oxygen-rich condition. It is observed that sample grown at 800 <sup>0</sup>C exhibits the highest saturation magnetisation with a Curie temperature approaching 850 K. <em>Rapid cooling </em>in air and heat treatment under an&nbsp;oxygen-poor condition at 200 <sup>0</sup>C for 5 h results in the reduction in saturation magnetisation. EPR results have confirmed that the air calcined samples have Mg vacancy centre, whereas vacuum calcined samples show signals corresponding to Mg vacancy as well as a signal related to the oxygen vacancy. With the support of DFT study, it is surmised that the high-temperature ferromagnetism for samples grown in oxygen-rich condition is due to the spin polarisation of the oxygen atoms surrounding the Mg vacancy.
425	Beating pattern in radiation-induced oscillatory magnetoresistance in 2DES: coupling of plasmon-like and acoustic phonon modes.	We present a microscopic theory on the observation of a beating pattern in the<br />radiation-induced magnetoresistance oscillations at very low magnetic field. We consider that such a beating pattern<br />develops as a result of the coupling between two oscillatory components:<br />the first is a system of electron Landau states<br />being harmonically driven by radiation. The second is a lattice oscillation, i.e.,<br /> an acoustic phonon mode. We analyze the dependence of the<br />beating pattern on temperature, radiation frequency and power.<br />We conclude that the beating pattern is an evidence of the radiation-driven<br />nature of the irradiated Landau states that makes them behave as a collective plasma oscillation<br />at the radiation frequency. Thus, the frequency of such plasmons could be tuned from<br />microwave to terahertz in the same nanodevice with an apparent technological application.
426	Using saturated H2O-ZnO nanofluid porous medium for cooling electronics contained in a inclined hemispherical enclosure	A nanofluid saturated porous medium is used for cooling plane electronic device contained in the base of a hemispherical cavity. According to the intended application in embarked electronics, the base could be tilted with respect to the horizontal plane by an angle ranging between 0&deg; and 180&deg; (horizontal disc with cupola facing upwards and downwards respectively). The volume fraction of the considered water-based ZnO nanofluid varies between 0 (pure water) and 10%, while the Rayleigh number based on the radius of the cavity ranges between 5.21x10<sup>7</sup> and 7.29x10<sup>10</sup>. The ratio between the thermal conductivity of the solid matrix of the porous medium and that of the base fluid varies between 0 and 70.<sup> </sup>Influence of these four parameters on the average temperature of the active electronic device is presented and commented. The work shows that the saturated porous medium has a significant effect on the thermal state of the electronic device. A correlation is proposed to easily calculate this temperature for any combination of these parameters, which allows thermal sizing for optimal cooling of this assembly used in electronics engineering.
427	<strong>Deformation mode transitions</strong><strong> in MgAl/Mg nanoscale amorphous/crystalline multilayers: A molecular dynamics study</strong>	The deformation behavior of MgAl/Mg nanoscale amorphous/crystalline multilayers (NACMs) with equal layer thicknesses of amorphous and crystalline phases under tension loading is investigated by molecular dynamics simulation method. The results show that the plastic deformation mode of NACMs changes from cross generalized shear bands dominated deformation to finally single SB plastic deformation with the increase of layer thickness, and the plastic deformation of NACMs with medium layer thickness is realized through cooperative interactions between crystalline layer, amorphous layer and amorphous/crystalline interfaces (ACIs), which could be treated as a transition progress. The results indicate that the peak stresses of the NACMs are greater than that of monolithic amorphous regardless of layer thickness, which is likely to result from the increase of the strong crystalline phase and the strengthening effect of the ACIs. The results also reveal that the ductility and strength of NACMs could be improved effectively by choosing the appropriate layer thicknesses. In addition, the deformation behavior of NACMs is also quantificationally disclosed and analyzed in current study.
428	Two-frequency undulator in a short SASE FEL for angstrom wavelengths	We perform theoretical study and modeling of harmonic evolution in X-ray single-pass free-electron laser (FEL) with two-frequency undulator. For this purpose a verified phenomenological FEL model is adopted, which accounts for all losses individually for each harmonic. The model was tested with FEL experiments, covering the radiation wavelengths range 0.15&ndash;300 nm. The phenomenological description, based on few main FEL parameters: electron beam current, energy and its spread, divergence, proves to give good match with measurements in various conditions. It is employed to model harmonic bunching and power evolution in an X-band FEL with two-frequency undulator, where 1-st and 3-rd harmonics are suppressed by 2&pi;/5 phase shift of the electrons respectively to photons between the undulator sections. The advantages of the two-frequency undulator in such phase-shifted X-ray FEL are highlighted. FEL-induced energy-spread evolution becomes 3 times lower, than in a common FEL. The possibility to produce intense X-ray radiation by dominant 5-th harmonic in linear regime is demonstrated. Radiation at sub-nanometric wavelength &lambda;<sub>5</sub>=0.15 nm from electrons with 5.47 GeV energy and ~3.66 kA current reaches ~14 GW power already at 30 m. This constitutes a half of a FEL length, where common planar undulator radiates the same wavelength and power by the fundamental harmonic. The power boost and reduction of the saturation length by half are complemented by 2.5 times lower electron energy. The harmonic power increase can be up to 10<sup>4</sup> times respectively to that in a common planar undulator FEL.
429	Chemical Synthesis and magnetic properties of Co<sub>2</sub>FeGa nanoparticles	We report the successful synthesis of Co$_2$FeGa nanoparticles by chemical method and characterization using x-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and magnetic measurements. The Rietveld refinements of XRD data with space group Fm$\bar {3}$m clearly show the formation of B2 disorder single phase. The particle size (D) decreases with increasing the SiO$_2$ concentration. The Bragg peaks and the parameters extracted from high-resolution TEM and SAED pattern are in well agreement with XRD. The coercivity initially increases from 8.5~nm to 12.5~nm, which follow the D$^{-3/2}$ dependence and then starts decreasing (D$^{-1}$ dependence) with increasing D. The critical size is found in between 12.5 to 16~nm in these nanoparticles. The effective magnetic anisotropic constant behaves similarly as coercivity, which indicates the transition from single domain to multi-domain regime as the domain structure changes significantly with the particle size.
430	Broadband voltage rectifier induced by linear bias dependence in CoFeB/MgO magnetic tunnel junctions	In this paper, the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) is tailored by changing the thickness of the free layer with the objective of producing MTJ nano-pillars with smooth linear resistance dependence with both in-plane magnetic field and DC bias. We furthermore demonstrate how this linear bias dependence can be used to create a zero-threshold broadband voltage rectifier, a feature which is important for rectification in wireless charging and energy harvesting applications. By carefully balancing the amount of PMA acting in the free layer the measured RF to DC voltage conversion efficiency can be made as large as 11%.
431	<strong>An <em>in silico</em> Inter-subject Variability Study of Extra-thoracic Morphology Effects on Inhaled Particle Transport and Deposition</strong>	An understanding of human inter-subject variability is crucial for the implementation of personalized pulmonary drug delivery as well as exposure assessment of airborne hazardous materials. However, due to the lack of statistically robust data and subsequent comparisons, the influence of human respiratory morphology on inhaled nano-/micro-particle transport and deposition is still not fully known. Thus, focusing on identifying geometric parameters that significantly influence airflow and inhaled particle transport/deposition, an experimentally validated Computational Fluid-Particle Dynamics (CFPD) model based on the Euler-Lagrange method is developed. &nbsp;To enhance the statistical robustness of the investigation, a virtual population group is created that contains seven distinct and widely used human upper-airway configurations, where the same tracheobronchial trees are extended to Generation 6. Numerical results and the inter-subject variability analysis indicate that the glottis constriction is the morphological parameter that significantly impacts the inhaled particle dynamics in the respiratory tract. For reasons of statistical robustness, anatomical features of the upper airways should be maintained to capture the <em>personalized</em> airflow and particle transport dynamics for particles smaller than 500 nm or larger than 2 &micro;m. However, a single upper airway model, representing a basic subpopulation group, can be employed to evaluate the <em>total</em> deposition of particles in the diameter range of 500 nm&lt;d<sub>p</sub>&lt;2 &micro;m. The present study provides an <em>in silico</em> lung-aerosol dynamics framework with detailed particle-deposition results and new physical insight. It may serve as a guide for implementing optimal targeting of inhaled drug-aerosols and for the assessment of hazardous aerosol exposure in distinct populations.
432	Protein Encapsulation via Polyelectrolyte Complex Coacervation: Protection against Protein Denaturation	Complex coacervation can be used as a route to compartmentalize a variety of solutes such as organic small molecules, inorganic nanoparticles as well as proteins within microscale coacervate droplets. To obtain insight into the accumulation of proteins within complex coacervate phases, the encapsulation of BSA within complex coacervates containing cationic polyelectrolyte poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and anionic polyelectrolyte poly (acrylic aid) (PAA) was investigated as a function of mixing sequence, total polyelectrolyte concentration, BSA overall concentration, as well as the mixing molar ratio of PAA/PAH. Mixing BSA having a negative net charge with the polycation PAH before coacervation, increasing the total polyelectrolyte concentration and PAA/PAH molar ratio, or decreasing the BSA overall concentration led to more efficient protein encapsulation. Preservation of secondary structure of BSA during the complex coacervation process was confirmed using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Our study shows that PAA-PAH coacervates can serve as protective system against the denaturation of BSA when exposed to extremes of pH, high temperatures, as well as in solution of urea. Additionally, it was found that by encapsulation of protein within coacervates via complex coacervation, the complexation between protein and heavy metal can be efficiently inhibited. Protection of BSA against severe environmental conditions via encapsulation within polyelectrolyte coacervates provides new insights and methods to issues of maintaining stability and function of proteins.
433	Effect of Calcium Ions on the Interactions between Surfaces End-Grafted With Weak Polyelectrolytes	The effect of multivalent ions on the interactions between two opposing surfaces grafted with weak polyelectrolytes was studied using a molecular theory.  More specifically, we study the interactions between two planar surfaces end-tethered with poly(acrylic acid) polymers in electrolyte solutions containing calcium ions. It is found that by adding divalent calcium ions to an aqueous solution of monovalent ions leads to a dramatic reduction in the size and range of effective interactions between the two polymer layers. This is caused  by the formation of favorable  calcium bridges, i.e., complexes of one calcium ion and two  carboxylic acid monomers, that  reduce effective charge sof the polymer layers and, at sufficient calcium ion concentrations, can cause the polymer  layers to collapse. For calcium ion concentrations above  approximately 1mM the repulsions between the opposing end-grafted surfaces disappears and attractions occur. These attractions are correlated with the occurrence of interlayer divalent calcium bridges  and do not occur for poly(acrylic acid) layers in contact with reservoir solutions containing only monovalent ions.  This result indicates the suitability of divalent calcium ions to control andschange the interaction range and strength, which is a useful  property that is desirable in the design of stimuli-responsive nanomaterials.
434	Long-range Synchronization of Nanomechanical Oscillators with Light	We experimentally demonstrate mutual synchronization of two free-running nanomechanical oscillators separated<br />by an effective distance of 28.5 meters and coupled through light. Due to the finite speed of light, the<br />large separation introduces a significant coupling delay of 139 nanoseconds, approximately four and a half<br />times the mechanical oscillation time period. We reveal multiple stable states of synchronized oscillations,<br />enabled by delayed coupling, with distinct synchronization frequencies in the coupled system. These states are<br />accessed by tuning independently the directional coupling strengths. Our results demonstrate rich dynamics<br />and can potentially simplify oscillator networks for neuromorphic computing.
435	Fast resolution change in neutral helium atom microscopy	In neutral helium atom microscopy, a beam of atoms is scanned across a surface. Though still in its infancy neutral helium microscopy has seen a rapid development over the last few years. The inertness and low energy of the helium atoms (less than 0.1 eV) combined with a very large depth of field and the fact that the helium atoms do not penetrate any solid material at low energies, open the possibility for a non-destructive instrument that can measure topology on the nanoscale even on fragile and insulating surfaces. The resolution is determined by the size of the beam (probe). Fast resolution change is an attractivesproperty of a microscope because it allows different aspects of a sample to be investigated and makes it easier to identify specific features. However up till now it has not been possible to change the resolution of a helium microscope without breaking the vacuum and change parts of the atom source. Here we present a modified source design, which allows fast, step wise resolution change. The basic design idea is to insert a moveable holder with a series of collimating apertures in front of the source, thus changing the effective source size of the beam and thereby the spot size on the surface and thus the microscope resolution. We demonstrate a design with 3 resolution steps. The number of resolution steps can easily be extended.
436	<strong>GaAs/GaNAs core-multishell nanowires with nitrogen concentration over 2%</strong>	We report the growth of GaAs/GaNAs/GaAs core-multishell nanowires having N concentrations over 2%. The structures were grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy using constituent Ga-induced vapor-liquid-solid growth on Si(111) substrates. The GaNAs shell nominally contains 0%, 2%, and 3% of nitrogen. The performed cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements confirm the existence of intended core-multishell structure. The performed room temperature micro-photoluminescence measurements reveal a red shift of the detected emission with increasing N content in the nanowires, consistent with the expected changes in the GaNAs bandgap energy due to the bowing effect.
437	<strong>Microstructures and magnetic properties of Tb-Fe-Co magnetic nanowire arrays prepared by electrochemical deposition</strong>	Highly ordered Tb-Fe-Co nanowires have been synthesized from Tb-Fe-Co aqueous solution by direct current electrochemical deposition with anodic alumina templates for the first time. The amorphous Tb-Fe phase and Tb-Co phase in as-deposited Tb-Fe-Co nanowires are transformed into Fe2Tb and Co2Tb crystal phases after annealed at 600&#x2103; for 3 h. Tb-Fe-Co nanowires have strong magnetic shape anisotropy. Comparing with the magnetic properties of Fe-Co nanowires, the coercivity and remanence ratio of annealed Tb-Fe-Co nanowires doped with Tb element increase significantly. The study about the impact of the doped rare earth elements Tb on Fe-Co nanowires may provide a way to improve the magnetic properties, and Tb-Fe-Co nanowires will certainly play an important role in future device research of magnetic recording devices.
438	Highly sensitive wearable strain sensor based on ultra-violet/ozone cracked carbon nanotube/elastomer	To simultaneously achieve high sensitivities (&gt; 100) and large stretchability (&gt; 50%) is still a grand challenge in developing the wearable strain sensors. In this study, a strain sensor with a high sensitivity up to 1020.2 and large stretchability of 100% was developed based on ultra-violet/ozone (UV/O<sub>3</sub>) cracked carbon nanotube/elastomers. The high sensitivity is ascribed to the widening of the cut-through cracks generated by the UV/O<sub>3</sub> surface engineering process. The UV/O<sub>3</sub>-cracked strain sensors show the potential application in electronic skins to detect various human motion signals such as bending of wrist, pulsing, and eye blinking.
439	Magnetic Moment and Magnetic Anisotropy of Co$_3$W Nanoclusters, Freestanding Surface, Co$|$Co$_3$W Bilayer and Superlattice by Density-Functional-Based Calculations	The cheaper permanent magnetic nanostructures with magnetic properties equivalent to noble-metal or rare-earth nanomagnets have been experimentally developed for their potential applications in ultrahigh-storage densities in magnetic memory. However, their intrinsic magnetic properties is not well understood under a microscope level. In this work, we performed the theoretical investigations on Co$_3$W bulk, freestanding surface, nanoclusters, as well as Co$|$Co$_3$W bilayer and superlattice for their magnetic moments, magnetic anisotropy energy (MAEs), and electronic structures. Our constructed Co$_3$W nanoclusters are stable and their stabilities increase with W proportion and particle size (up to 1.2 nm). It was well established that Co and W atoms are antiferromagnetically coupled and their magnetic magnitudes decrease with the increasing W proportion. The experimentally observed breakdown of the Hund's third rule in W atoms can be interpreted as the competitions between the intra-atomic SOC in W atoms and Co-W inter-atomic hybridizations. The highest MAE value, about few ten meV, was obtained in small sizes, whereas it is an order of magnitude reduction in large sizes. For Co$_3$W freestanding surface, Co$|$Co$_3$W bilayer and superlattice, they present the large perpendicular MAEs. Our magnetic moment and MAE have the same order of the magnitude of recently experimental measurements, and their electronic origination is revealed through the second-order perturbation method.
440	<strong>Highly Efficient Hybrid Bulk Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells Integrating PbS Nanoparticles </strong>	A brief study on the binary and ternary blended nanostructured based hybrid organic solar cells was conducted. The active layer of the prepared devices composed of constant ratios of the electron donating organic semiconductor, P3HT-poly(3-hexylthiophene) and the electron accepting fullerene <em>PCBM</em>-[6,6] phenyl-C61-<em>butyric acid methyl ester</em> with various ratios of an inorganic semiconductor PbS dissolved in CB-chlorobenzene and DCB. The effect of various concentrations of nanoparticles on the performance of P3HT/PCBM was examined. The PCE - power conversion efficiency with NPs doping in the polymer active layer was improved significantly under standard irradiance (100mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, AM1.5G). This increase in efficiency was owing to decrease in series resistance-Rs with the conjugation of PbS NPs in a blend of the organics active layer. The morphological and optical properties were investigated with FESEM, AFM and UV-visible spectrophotometer respectively.<sup> </sup>
441	Probing flexoelectricity via a split Hopkinson pressure bar experiment	Flexoelectricity is thought of as a universal property of all dielectric materials that couples polarization with the inhomogeneous deformation. However, at the macroscale, this coupling is usually very weak and the direct observation of flexoelectricity always suffers by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). At the micron or submicron scale, both the flexoelectric effect and some surface effects may get pronounced simultaneously. To separate the flexoelectric effect from those surface effects and accurately measure the bulk flexoelectric coefficients is challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel high SNR method for measuring the bulk flexoelectric coefficient &nbsp;of millimeter-sized samples through split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) experiments. Our experimental results show that for normal impact speed (17m/s) of the striker bar, the induced voltage difference is as high as 70mV which can be easily measured without using signal amplifiers. In most of previous works of measuring flexoelectric coefficients, strain gradients are introduced through the design of samples&rsquo; shape such as thin beams, thin films, truncated cones and pyramids. In a different way, the proposed SHPB based approach introduces time varied strains to the system and then converts time gradients of strains into their spatial gradients through elastic waves. As a promising way of measuring bulk flexoelectric coefficients, this approach produces high SNR flexoelectric signals, reduces the interferences from surface effects, and avoids the difficulties in fabricating nanostructures.
442	Electronic, Magnetic and Transport properties of silicene Armchair nanoribbons substituted with monomer and dimer of Fe atom	This study employed density functional theory calculations to investigate the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of an armchair silicene nanoribbon (ASiNR) substituted with a monomer and a dimer of Fe atom. As a result, the direct band gap of pristine ASiNR turns into a smaller indirect band gap by substituting an Fe atom in the proper position. The magnetic moment of doped Fe reduces and the structure keeps its nonmagnetic property. The substitution of the Fe-dimer can change the pristine ASiNR from a nonmagnetic semiconductor to a magnetic half-metal, which is favorable for spintronic devices. Two external electric fields were applied to the structure substituted with the Fe-dimer and electronic properties were studied in this situation. It was shown that the Fe-dimer substituted ASiNR is such a versatile material that a band gap can be tuned by using an external transverse electric field. Furthermore, the transport properties of these two structures were studied with non-equilibrium Greens function formalism. It is intriguing that single-spin negative differential resistance was observed in the Fe-dimer doped ASiNR.

444	<strong>SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF</strong><strong>LaMn<sub>1-x</sub>Fe<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2)</strong><strong> BY </strong><strong>COPRECIPITATION</strong><strong> ROUTE</strong>	Perovskite type oxides are fascinating nanomaterials and its physical properties of interest to materials science through perovskites include superconductivity, magnetoresistance, ionic conductivity, and a multitude of dielectric properties, which are of great importance in microelectronics and telecommunication. Recently interest has arisen in perovskite-type oxides as catalysts due to high thermal and hydrothermal stability as well as high mechanical strength among other properties. In the present work, LaMn<sub>1-x</sub>Fe<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> perovskite was synthesized by the co-precipitation method. The product was characterized with X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and conductivity study. The XRD pattern confirmed the formation of perovskite phase. The SEM micrographs indicated that the morphology contain porosity due to inter-particle voids. The presence of functional groups of the pure and doped lanthanum manganite were studied by FTIR. The optical band gap decrease with increasing the content of iron in the sample. The conductivity study confirmed that the conductivity increases with increasing the content of iron.
445	Effect of cholesterol on the binding of the precursor neurotransmitter tryptophan to zwitterionic membranes	The characterization of the microscopical forces between the essential -amino-acid tryptophan, precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin and of the hormone melatonin, and the basic components of cell membranes and their environments (phospholipids, cholesterol, ionic species and water) is of central importance to elucidate their local structure and dynamics as well as the mechanisms responsible for the access of tryptophan to the interior of the cell. We have performed nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations of tryptophan embedded in model zwitterionic bilayer membranes made by di-palmytoil-phosphatidyl-choline and cholesterol inside aqueous sodium-chloride solution in order to systematically examine tryptophan-lipid, tryptophan-cholesterol and tryptophan-water interactions at the corresponding human body temperature and salt concentration. Microscopic properties such as the area per lipid, lipid thickness, radial distribution functions, hydrogen-bonding lengths, potentials of mean force, atomic spectral densities and self-diusion coe;cients have been evaluated. Our results show that the presence of tryptophan signicantly aects the structure and dynamics of the membrane. Tryptophan spends long periods of time at the water-membrane interface and it plays a central role by bridging a few lipids and cholesterol chains by means of hydrogen-bonds. The computed spectral densities, in excellent agreement with experimental infrared and Raman data, revealed the participation of each atomic site of tryptophan to the complete spectrum of the molecule. Tryptophan self-diusion coe;cients have been found to be in between 10^(-7) and 10^(-6) cm2/s and strongly depending of the concentration of cholesterol in the system.
446	Near-infrared light absorption enhancement in Ge nanostructures prepared by nano-sphere lithography	In the present work, Ge nanostructures were prepared by using polystyrene nano-sphere lithography technique. By changing the diameter of the nano-spheres and controlling the etching time, Ge nanostructures with various morphologies were obtained which exhibited the good anti-reflection and optical absorption enhancement characteristics, especially in the near infrared light spectral range (900-1500nm). The optical properties of Ge nanostructures were also simulated by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solutions by building the model based on the observed Ge nanostructures. It was suggested that Ge nanostructures etched by using large-sized nano-spheres, like 2000nm, can significantly suppress the reflection of incident light in a wide spectral range but absorb the near infrared light more efficiently compared with the visible light.
447	Direct Ink Writing of 3D Honeycombed CL-20 Structures with High Performance	3D Honeycombed CL-20 structures have been fabricated for intelligent weapon systems by direct ink writing technology. The CL-20/WPU/EC composite ink with high detonation performance was deposited through a fine nozzle on the substrate by a layer-by-layer sequence to produce the 3D structures. Preparation of the composite ink, as well as the principles of the direct ink writing process was investigated systematically. The deposited explosive composite materials has a honeycombed structure with high porosity. No phase change was observed during the preparation process. Waterborne polyurethane (WPU) and ethyl cellulose (EC) show good compatibility with CL-20 particles. Higher apparent activation energy was obtained in CL-20-based composite ink comparing with that of nano-CL-20 due to the presence of non-energetic but stable WPU. The detonation performance of the composite materials can be precisely controlled by adjusting the content of binders. Detonation tests show that the 3D honeycombed CL-20 structures fabricated by DIW have a very small critical detonation size of less than 108 &#x03BC;m, which presents a bright future for the development of intelligent weapon systems.
448	Negative Differential Resistance Effect Aroused by a Unique Carrier Transport in X-like Graphene Nanoribbon Structure	In this paper, a novel twisted X-like armchair graphene nanoribbon (X-AGNR) structure, which exhibits negative differential resistance (NDR), is proposed. Investigating with the quantum simulation based on self-consistent Extended Huckel method, the X-AGNR device shows significant NDR effect when the twist angle is larger than 40 degrees. Through the detailed analysis of X-AGNR&rsquo;s transport properties, we uncover the NDR effect is caused by the match and mismatch of carrier transport channels on the two edges of the twisted region. The value of current peak and the peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR) can be modulated by the twist angle and size effect. This novel transport mechanism enriches the modulation methods of low-dimensional structure&rsquo;s NDR phenomenon and inspires a new idea to the development of graphene devices.
449	Femtosecond laser-induced transformations in ultra-low expansion glass:  microstructure and local density variations by vibrational spectroscopy	We report X-ray diffraction, resonance Raman and infrared (IR) results on pristine ultra-low expansion (ULE) glass, a binary titanosilicate glass with 5.67 mol% TiO2.  Besides applications requiring high geometrical stability at room temperature, ULE processing by femtosecond (fs) laser radiation leads to nanogratings writing and photo-darkening for imaging and data storage. The knowledge gained here on pristine ULE is employed to understand the transformation mechanisms in this glass by fs laser irradiation at 515 nm. Optical imaging revealed the formation of micro-cavities, and Raman mapping showed molecular oxygen trapped in such cavities of laser-irradiated ULE glass. While titanium in pristine ULE was found predominantly in tetrahedral Ti4+ sites highly dispersed in the silicate matrix, Raman and IR reflectance spectroscopy on laser-irradiated ULE indicated the formation of Ti3+ sites; Ti3+ octahedral sites are formed in the shells of cavities and aggregate in amorphous Ti2O3-type clusters, while the glass around and below cavities contains Ti3+ tetrahedral sites dispersed in the silicate network. Laser-processed ULE glass was found to exhibit also local restructuring of the silicate matrix. Shifts of the strong IR band at about 1080-1100 cm-1 were translated into changes of the average Si-O-Si bond angle in the laser-transformed areas, and found to reflect local density variations; the average local density increases relative to silica glass by about 8% in the shells of micro-cavities and decreases by about 0.5% in the surrounding material. Chemical processes were proposed to account for photo-darkening and local structural transformation effect in the probed areas of the fs laser-processed ULE glasses.
450	Swelling of Nanodomains in Hydrated Block Copolymer Electrolyte Membranes	In this work, we examine the swelling of nanostructured block copolymer electrolytes immersed in liquid water. A series of sulfonated polystyrene-b-polyethylene-b-polystyrene (S-SES) membranes having the same nominal chemical composition but two different morphologies are prepared by systematic changes in processing. We start with a membrane comprising a mixture of homopolymer polystyrene (hPS) and a polystyrene-b-polyethylene-b-polystyrene (SES) copolymer. Homopolymer hPS is subsequently selectively removed from the membrane and the polystyrene domains are sulfonated to give S-SES membranes. The morphology of the membranes is controlled by controlling &#x03D5;v, the volume fraction of hPS in the blended membrane. The morphology of the membranes was studied by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (cryo-STEM) and cryogenic electron tomography. The overall domain swelling measured by SAXS decreases slightly at &#x03D5;v =0.29; a cross-over from lamellar to bicontinuous morphology is obtained at the same value of &#x03D5;v. The bicontinuous morphologies absorb more water than the lamellar morphologies.  In contrast, the nanodomain swelling of the bicontinuous membrane is slightly less than that of the lamellar membrane.  Quantitative analysis of the STEM images and electron tomography was used determine the swelling on the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains due to exposure to water.  The hydrophilic PSS-rich domain spacing increases while the hydrophobic PE domain spacing decreases when the membranes are hydrated.  The extent of increase and decrease is not a strong function of &#x03D5;v.
451	Observation of the Hanle effect in giant magnetoresistance measurements	We report the observation of the Hanle effect in the giant magnetoresistance measurement of metallic lateral nanostructures. By applying magnetic fields perpendicularly to the magnetization of the electrodes, we obtain resistance values lower than that of the parallel magnetization state, due to the extra decoherence provided by the random propagation time of the carriers. An analytical model is developed, enabling us to extract the characteristic transport parameters of CoFe, Al and Cu from the fitting of the experimental results. We compare the obtained parameters to that of standard non-local Hanle measurements in lateral spin-valves, with the interest that this measurement configuration gives much larger signal variation.
452	<strong>EBSD-Investigation and Magnetic Properties of Manganese Ferrite Crystallized in a Sodium-Silicate Glass</strong>	Glasses in the system (100 - x)(0.16Na<sub>2</sub>O/0.10MnO/0.74SiO<sub>2</sub>)/xFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, (x = 5&ndash;25<sub> </sub>in mol %)<sub> </sub>were prepared using the traditional melt-quenching technique. They were subsequently crystallized at temperatures in the range from 520 to 700 &deg;C for times ranging from 10 min to 100 h. The elemental composition and the valence states of selected glasses and glass-ceramics were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and showed the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> while Fe occurs as both Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup>. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses showed the crystallization of a solid solution of the cubic spinel phases MnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and/or Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> but for higher temperatures and longer annealing times, also the crystallization of aegirine, NaFe(SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. The average spinel crystallite size was determined to range from 4 to 10 nm by XRD. The microstructure was investigated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) as well as electron-backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The EBSD analyses show that the cubic crystals grow via the polygon as well as the dendritic growth mechanisms. The individual grains show independent orientations and inclusions of residual glass while a crystallographic texture could not be detected. The obtained magnetization curves for the compositions in which nanosized spinel crystals precipitate showed that samples crystallized at 650 and 700 &deg;C are superparamagnetic and exhibit thin S-shaped magnetization curves with zero coercivity.
453	<strong>Influence of ERTA on magnetocaloric properties of Sr doped BaFe<sub>12</sub>O<sub>19 </sub>thin films for cryogenics</strong>	The effect of electron beam rapid thermal annealing (ERTA) on the crystallographic, structural, magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of Sr doped M-type barium hexaferrite thin films (Ba<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>12</sub>O<sub>19</sub>) deposited on silicon (001) substrates were investigated. The effect of electron beam rapid thermal annealing (ERTA) on the crystallographic, structural, magnetic and magnetocaloric properties. Amorphous to crystalline phase transitions occurred when the as-deposited thin films were annealed, however crystallinity reduced as a function of Sr concentration. The as-deposited thin films showed uniform grain size and distribution with reduction in grain size as a function of Sr concentration, whereas annealed thin films showed agglomerated structures that increased in numbers as a function of Sr concentration. As-deposited thin films with x = 0, 0.5 and 1.0 showed anti-ferromagnetic, weak ferromagnetic and super-paramagnetic response, respectively. Magnetic hysteresis loops and magnetic force microscopy images indicated improved c-axis in-plane magnetization with reduced coercivity for Sr doped thin films, and saturation magnetization for thin films subjected to ERTA. The Arrott plots in positive quadrant suggested a typical M-type ferrite behaviour with second-order ferromagnetic phase transitions around the Curie temperature. The entropy changes associated with magnetic phase transitions were determined using magnetization measurements performed in the range of 50-105 K for as-deposited and 65-125 K for ERTA samples under different magnetic fields. The calculated maximum relative cooling power (RCP) of the as-deposited and ERTA thin films are1941 mJ/cc and 3065 mJ/cc for 50 kOe magnetic fields. This makes Ba<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>12</sub>O<sub>19 </sub>with x=1 a promising candidate for micro and nano magnetic refrigeration systems.
454	<strong>Eliminating Common Biases in Modeling Electrical Conductivity of Carbon Nanotubes-Polymer Nanocomposites</strong>	Modelling electrical conductivity of carbon-nanotubes (CNT)-polymer nanocomposites demands high computational power. A common approach to circumvent this challenge is by using a small cubic representative volume element (RVE) to simulate CNT conductive network in a polymer matrix. By assuming these networks follow a periodic pattern, any randomly dispersed CNT that protrudes outside the RVE is cut and relocated to point into the RVE from the opposite boundary surface. Representing dispersed CNT by a random resistor network, simulations revealed that the &ldquo;cut-and-relocate&rdquo; approach led to significantly higher CNT concentration in proximity of RVE&rsquo;s walls and shorter CNT length. These biases resulted in inaccurate representative of the morphology of CNT-polymer nanocomposites. This work revealed that using a double-box RVE model and removing any cut CNT protrudes outside the RVE can eliminate the biases and improve simulation accuracy.
455	<strong>Electric switching of visible and infrared transmission using liquid crystals co-doped with plasmonic gold nanorods and dichroic dyes</strong>	Smart windows and many other applications require synchronous or alternating facile electric switching of transmitted light intensity in visible and near infrared spectral ranges, but most electrochromic devices suffer from slow, nonuniform switching, high power consumption and limited options for designing spectral characteristics. Here we develop a guest-host mesostructured composite with rod-like dye molecules and plasmonic nanorods spontaneously aligned either parallel or orthogonally to the director of the liquid crystal host. This composite material enables fast, low-voltage electric switching of electromagnetic radiation in visible and infrared ranges, which can be customized depending on the needs of applications, like climate-dependent optimal solar gain control in smart windows.
456	Influence of plasma-modified nanosilica from rice husks on mechanical properties of epoxy composites	Agricultural wastes such as rice husks was utilized as nanosilica (nSiO2) source. Plasma modification of nSiO2 powders was conducted using a capacitively coupled 13.56 MHz RF plasma under an admixture of argon and hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) or 1,7-octadiene (OD) monomers. Incorporation of plasma-treated nSiO2 at 1% and 5% loading volumes exhibits a more hydrophobic epoxy composite due to attachment of hydrophobic functional group of the nSiO2 surface. Hardness and elastic moduli also increased as loading volume increased with the HMDSO-treated nSiO2 epoxy composite exhibiting the largest increase.
457	Bernal Stacking-Assisted Shear Exfoliation of Nanoplate Bilayers	Nanoplates such as graphene and MoS<sub>2</sub> are promising materials due to their excellent electronic and mechanical properties. The preparation of such nanoplates is, however, still challenging due to the large free energy barrier that multilayer nanoplates need to overcome during exfoliation. In case of a Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, the binding energy between two graphene layers is about 17.8 meV per atom such that harsh chemical and/or mechanical treatment is usually necessary. In this paper, we perform extensive molecular dynamics simulations for a generic model of nanoplates, and illustrate that when the shear of a moderate shear rate is applied to the nanoplate bilayer solution, the nanoplate bilayer may exfoliate readily. In our simulations, the free energy barrier that two nanoplate layers need to overcome reaches up to 21.8 k<sub>B</sub>T, where k<sub>B</sub> and T denote the Boltzmann constant and temperature, respectively. This implies that without external stimuli, the nanoplate bilayer would hardly exfoliate. Upon the application of shear, however, the transition between different Bernal stacked conformations occurs, which provides multiple intermediate states for exfoliation and facilitates the shear exfoliation. We also find that if one were to increase the affinity between solvent and nanoplates slightly, the free energy barrier would be decreased significantly.
458	<strong>Probing migration property of cancer cells stimulated by on-chip periodic mechanical confinement</strong>	Cancer cell migration and invasion, which are involved in tumour metastasis, are hard to predict and control. Numerous studies have demonstrated that physical cues influence cancer cell migration and affect tumour metastasis. In this study, we proposed the use of a microchannel chip equipped with a number of vertical constrictions to produce periodic compression forces on cells passing through narrow channels. The chip with repeated vertical confinement was applied on adherent MHCC-97L liver cancer cells and suspended OCI-AML leukaemia cells to determine the migration ability of these cancer cells. Given the stimulation of the periodic mechanical confinement on-chip, the migration ability of cancer cells was promoted. Moreover, the migration speed increased as the stimulation was enhanced. Both AFM nanoindentation and optical stretching tests on cancer cells were performed to measure their mechanical property. After confinement stimulation, the cancer cells possessed higher deformability and lower stiffness than non-stimulating cells. The confinement stimulation altered the cell cytoskeleton, which governs the migration speed. This phenomenon was determined through gene expression analysis. The proposed on-chip cell migration assays will help characterise the migration property of cancer cells and benefit the development of new therapeutic strategies for metastasis.
459	<strong> Sensing analysis based on tunable Fano resonance in terahertz graphene-layered metamaterial</strong><strong>s</strong><strong> </strong>	We theoretically investigate the sensing characteristics based on the tunable Fano resonance in terahertz graphene-layered metamaterials. A Fano phenomenon comes from the destructive interferences in a narrow frequency range and it can lead to a high figure of merit of &sim;9786. A simple model for the sensitivity is presented and the sensitivity can reach to 7885 nm/RIU. Besides, the Fano peak becomes more and more unobvious as symmetry breaking slowly recovering. We use an appropriate theoretical theory to explain the generation of Fano phenomena. Our proposed structure and investigation may pave the way for fundamental research of the nanosensor applications and designs in highly integrated optical circuits.
460	<strong>Enhanced Nonlinear Optical Susceptibilities in Phosphorene Nanoribbons: Ab initio study</strong>	Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) method we compute linear optical absorption spectra and nonlinear optical susceptibilities of hydrogen passivated armchair and zigzag Phosphorous Nanoribbons (aPNR and zPNR) as well as &alpha;-phase phosphorous monolayer. We observe that: (a) Crystallographic direction has a strong effect on the band edge absorption which causes optical anisotropy as well as a red shift of absorption spectra by increasing the nanoribbon width. (b) The absorption values are in the order of 10<sup>5</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup> which are close to the experimentally measured values. (c) There is two orders of magnitude enhancement of the 2<sup>nd</sup> order nonlinear optical susceptibility, &chi;<sup>(2)</sup>, in nanoribbons which emanates from breaking the centro-symmetric structure of a monolayer phosphorene by hydrogen surface terminations. (d) Chief among our results is that the 3<sup>rd</sup> order susceptibility, &chi;<sup>(3)</sup>, for phosphorene monolayer and nanoribbons are about &asymp;10<sup>-13 </sup>esu (&asymp;10<sup>-21</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/V<sup>2</sup>) which are in close agreement with experimentally reported values. This strongly supports reliability of our method in calculating nonlinear optical susceptibilities of phosphorene and in general other nanostructures. Enhanced 2<sup>nd</sup> order optical nonlinearity in phosphorene promises better second harmonic and frequency difference (THz) generation for photonics applications.
461	Effect of silver doping by ion implantation on graphene nanoplatelets properties	The structural, electronic and optical properties of thin films based on physically prepared graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) doped by silver ion implantation have been studied. The silver dopant percentage relatively carbon of 1.18 % has been achieved and metal nanoparticles have been formed. The conductivity of the graphene sheet after ion implantation was found to be lowered by the presence of such graphene lattice defects. It was also shown that the surface of the GNP nanoplatelet is not planar, and there are many areas with different local orientation. It has been concluded that in spite of relatively little amount of the attached silver atoms and silver nanoparticles to the GNP surface, the essential changes of GNP structure occur during the ion implantation process, apparently breaking the structure of &#xF070;-electron system, what is confirmed by electron microscopic, Raman and electrophysical measurements.
462	Competing charge trapping and percolation in core-shell single wall carbon nanotubes/ polyaniline nanostructured composites	Core-shell single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT)/ polyaniline (PANI) nanocomposites were chemically synthesized and their structural, morphological, and dielectric properties were investigated as a function of the nanofiller content. FE-SEM and TEM images confirm the core-shell nanostructural features of the composites. Broadband dielectric spectroscopy allows the detection of an interfacial dielectric relaxation mechanism which is quite dependent on the dispersion of nanoparticles into the semi-conducting polyaniline matrix. Furthermore, the relaxation process analyzed through Kohlrausch-William-Watts (KWW) model, is found to take place at lower nanofiller loading but progressively fades away on increasing the amount of SWCNT, yielding relaxation spectra which gradually resemble that of a pure conductor. In addition, it is found that competing processes between electrical percolation and interfacial capacitance effects are inherently dependent on the carbon-filler contents. Such behavior is ascribed to charge trapping and de-trapping phenomenaoccurring at core-shell interfaces. The possibility of tuning the composition of the nanocomposites so as to trigger an interplay between capacitance and dc-electrical conduction is envisioned for use in the next generation organic-based supercapacitor or gate memory devices.
463	Chemical synthesis and magnetic properties of Co2FeGa nanoparticles	We report the successful synthesis of Co$_2$FeGa nanoparticles by chemical method and characterization using x-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and magnetic measurements. The Rietveld refinements of XRD data with space group Fm$\bar {3}$m clearly show the formation of B2 disorder single phase. The particle size (D) decreases with increasing the SiO$_2$ concentration. The Bragg peak positions and the inter-planer spacing extracted from high-resolution TEM and SAED pattern are in well agreement with XRD. The coercivity initially increases from 8.5~nm to 12.5~nm, which follow the D$^{-3/2}$ dependence and then starts decreasing (D$^{-1}$ dependence) with increasing D. The critical size is found in between 12.5 to 16~nm in these nanoparticles. The effective magnetic anisotropic constant behaves similarly as coercivity, which indicates the transition from single domain to multi-domain regime as the domain structure changes significantly with the particle size.
464	Beneficial impact of tunneling in nano-structured intermediate-band  solar cell	Using the non equilibrium Green functions formalism we propose a study of theelectronic excitation and collection in nano-structured intermediate-band solarcell. We demonstrate that a thin tunnel barrier between the nano-objects andthe host material is beneficial for both current and voltage. For the current,the confinement generated by such a thin barrier favors the intersubbandoptical coupling in the nano-objects and then improves theexcitation-collection trade-off. We also show that a broadened density-of-statein the nano-objects increases the radiative recombination and then degrades thevoltage. Using a detailed balance model we propose a broadening factor for thisVoc degradation which decreases when a tunnel barrier enhances the life-time inthe nano-objects.
465	FORMATION OF NANODIMENSIONAL STRUCTURES ON MgO FILM SURFACE UNDER BOMBARDMENT BY LOW-ENERGY IONS	The Mg nano-films of 1-2 nm in thickness have been produced on the surface of MgO/Mg under bombardment by Ar+ ions. A composition of the Mg nano-film surface has been studied, as well as its electronic structure and morphology. A model zone-energy diagram of the Mg/MgO system has been constructed. The thin layers of Mg are potentially suitable for creating the device structures like metal-dielectric-semiconductor, nanodimensional contacts and barrier layers of the surface of semiconductor and dielectric films.
466	A novel micro-photogrammetric Instrument for visualizing in 3D small objects applied to the quantitative study of the dissolution behavior of a pharmaceutical dosage form.	3D imaging has a wide range of applications from mapping landscapes on the scale of kilometers to nano-sized objects such as computer chips. Photogrammetry is a well-established technique for creating 3D models of objects on large length scales but has not previously been applied to optical microscopy. We present the first results using a versatile instrument for micro-photogrammetry. An application of interest is the study pharmaceutical dosage forms that present particular difficulties for other methods of quantitative 3D optical imaging. We describe a novel system for studying samples of this type as applied to investigating dissolution behavior.
467	Vibrational spectroscopy via stimulated Raman induced Kerr lensing	We present a new method for the measurement of the stimulated Raman spectrum based on time-dependent spatial modulation of a laser beam as it passes through a Raman active medium. This effect is similar to the instantaneous Kerr lensing and Kerr deflection, yet involves resonant vibrations which result in a time-dependent refractive index change. We use sub-nanojoule pulses together with a sensitive pump-probe measurement apparatus to excite and detect the fine (10^-5 - 10^-4) temporal and spatial variations in intensity resulting from the Raman induced Kerr effect. We demonstrate the effect by changing the spatial overlap between the pump and probe at the sample, and measuring the time-dependent deformation of the probe beam's cross section. This method is particularly useful for detection of low frequency Raman lines, as we demonstrate by measuring Raman spectrum of neat liquids in a cuvette.
468	<strong>Nanoparticulate CdS 2D Array by Chemical Bath Deposition: </strong><strong>Characterization and Optoelectronic Study</strong>	Nanostructured CdS thin film was successfully deposited on glass substrate by chemical bath deposition (CBD) at 80 <sup>o</sup>C. The effect of deposition time on the morphology, composition, optical and optoelectronic properties of nanostructured CdS thin films has been studied. The CBD-grown CdS thin films showed assemble of interconnected nanoparticles in 2D morphology. Nanostructured CdS thin films exhibited metastable cubic phase having uniform, compact and defect-free structure with enhanced crystallinity. Tauc plot of CBD-grown nanostructured CdS thin film showed an optimum band gap of 2.30 eV and a resonant Raman peak at 302.2 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The transverse optics (TO) mode, multi-phonon scattering and high-order replicas of nanostructured CdS thin films were also observed in the Raman study. Metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) based CdS Photodetector (PD) was fabricated for optoelectronic device characterization. Fabricated Au/CdS/Au MSM PD showed an excellent photodetectivity of 3.8x10<sup>13</sup> Jones. Photoconductive performance such as photo-sensitivity (206.8 %) and - responsivity (0.38 A/W @ 420 nm) under an illumination condition of 100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> was obtained for application in visible-light photodetector.
469	<strong>Performance analysis of  graphene plasmonic nanoantenna using silicon based substrates</strong>	Surface plasmons in the graphene exhibit unique properties of low losses, strong confinement, field enhancement, long range propagation and high tunability at sub-wavelength scales. Owing to unique EM properties and support of surface plasmon polariton at Terhertzfrequency, graphene has gained momentum for the realization of graphene plasmonic nanoantenna. Graphene plasmonic nanoantennas using different silicon based substrates such as silicon, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, and silicon carbide are presented in this work. Antennas are analyzed in terms of the reflection, resonant frequency, radiation pattern, half power beam width, front to back ratio and directivity.The proposed graphene plasmonic nanoantennas will be promising for THz communication, sensing, and biomedical application.
470	<strong>Field emission properties of indium decorated vertically aligned carbon nanotubes: An interplay between type of hybridization, density of states and metal thickness</strong>	Field emission (FE) properties of Indium decorated vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) films are investigated. The superior FE properties are achieved for 4 nm thick Indium coated MWCNTs as compared to those coated with higher thicknesses of Indium and pristine CNTs. Improvement in the FE properties are mainly attributed to transformation of sp<sup>2</sup> to sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized carbons and Indium thickness. Other factors important for the better FE properties are enhanced density of states near the Fermi level and slightly improved field enhancement factor at relatively low applied electric fields.
471	Tuning the charge transport and photo-physical behavior in nanocomposite of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and silver sulfide quantum dots	The charge transport properties are studied in hybrid thin films composed of poly(3-hexylthiophene) polymer (P3HT) and silver sulfide (Ag<sub>2</sub>S) quantum dots (QDs) by temperature and photo-dependent current-voltage (J-V) characteristics. A complete reversal in J-V characteristics is observed in ITO/Nanocomposite/Au devices as the QDs&rsquo; concentration in the polymer matrix reaches to 50 weight percentage (wt. %).  A detailed study of charge injection through ITO exhibits a transition in transport mechanism from direct tunneling to thermionic emission with increasing QDs up to 20 wt. % and further governed by space charge limited conduction for 50 and 80 wt. % devices. Charge injection through Au shows the transition from Poole-Frenkel to thermionic emission as the QDs surpasses 10 wt. % in polymer matrix. The effect of injection barrier and charge transfer phenomena on the transport properties are discussed in details by photoluminescence and photocurrent measurements.
472	<strong>Synthesis and characterization of D-glucuronic acid-coated Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Yb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles as potential </strong><strong>computed tomography</strong><strong> contrast agents</strong>	In this study, Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Yb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles coated with biocompatible and hydrophilic D-glucuronic acid were prepared through a simple one-step polyol process and their X-ray attenuation properties were investigated. The average particle diameters of these nanoparticles were estimated to be 1.5 and 2.0 nm, respectively, by transmission electron microscopy. Their observed X-ray attenuation power was in the order of Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticle &gt; Yb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticle &gt; Ultravist<sup>&reg;</sup> [a commercial molecular iodine computed tomography (CT) contrast agent] at the same atomic concentration. This order was consistent with that of the magnitudes of their atomic X-ray attenuation coefficients (&mu;), i.e., &mu; (Bi) &gt; &mu; (Yb) &gt; &mu; (I). The X-ray attenuation powers of the nanoparticle samples were much stronger than that of Ultravist<sup>&reg;</sup> at the same number density, indicating that all the nanoparticle samples are potential CT contrast agents.
473	<strong>Topological Insulator-Metal Transition and Molecular Electronics Device based on ZigZag PhaGraphene NanoRibbon</strong>	In this work we investigate the electronic transport properties comparing with the results of the <em>Transition-Voltage Spectroscopy</em> (TVS) and propose the behavior characteristic of topological insulator for a graphene allotrope composed of 5-6-7 carbon aromatic rings called phagraphene. Its properties were compared to graphene in a zigzag nanoribbon configuration, i. e., zigzag Graphene and PhaGraphene NanoRibbon (zzGNR and zzPGNR). The molecular geometry and the electronic properties were calculated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) without spin and the electronic transport was obtained by means Extended H&uuml;ckel Theory/Non-Equilibrium Green&acute;s Function (EHT/NEGF) when we couple the optimized molecular geometry of zzGNR and zzPGNR at the Leads (Left and Right) forming the molecular junction effectively that will be subjected to the action of an external bias voltage (<em>V<sub>e</sub></em>) to generate the molecular electronic device. The results exhibit: <em>(i)</em> metal-insulator transition when the <em>V<sub>e</sub></em> is increased until <em>V<sub>e</sub> =</em>1.4V and nonlinear region (resonance) showing <em>Field Effect Transistor (FET)</em> behaviour for zzGNR junction; <em>(ii)</em> two nonlinear regions (two Negative Differential Resistances, NDRs), showing<em> tunnel diode</em> <em>behaviour with two operation windows </em><em>(V<sub>e</sub> = 0.5V and V<sub>e</sub> = 1.7V) </em>for zzPGNR junction. Besides, zzPGNR junction exhibits topological insulator characteristics due to introducing topological defects such as pentagons and heptagons in the hexagonal lattice of graphene and when <em>V<sub>e</sub></em> = 1.7V occurs a topological insulator-metal transition which can be seen in DOS, Transmittance and <em>Frontier Molecular Orbitals</em> (FMOs) under <em>V<sub>e</sub></em>.
474	<strong>Enhanced interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and isolated skyrmions in the inversion-symmetry-broken Ru/Co/W/Ru films</strong>	An enhancement of the spin-orbit effects arising on an interface between a ferromagnet (<em>FM</em>) and a heavy metal (<em>HM</em>) is possible through the strong breaking of the structural inversion symmetry in the layered films. Here, we show that an introduction of an ultrathin W interlayer between Co and Ru in <em>Ru/Co/Ru</em> films enables to preserve perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and simultaneously induce a large interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI). The study of the spin-wave propagation in the Damon-Eshbach geometry by Brillouin light scattering (BLS) spectroscopy reveals the drastic increase of the iDMI value with increase in W thickness (<em>t<sub>W</sub></em>). The maximum iDMI of -3.1 erg/cm<sup>2</sup> is observed for <em>t<sub>W</sub></em>=0.24 nm, which is 10 times larger than for the quasi-symmetrical <em>Ru/Co/Ru</em> films. We demonstrate the evidence of the spontaneous field-driven nucleation of isolated skyrmions supported by micromagnetic simulations. Magnetic force microscopy measurements reveals the existence of sub-100-nm skyrmions in zero magnetic field. The ability to simultaneously control the strength of PMA and iDMI in quasi-symmetrical <em>HM/FM/HM</em> trilayer systems through the interface engineered inversion asymmetry at the nanoscale excites new fundamental and practical interest in ultrathin ferromagnets, which are a potential host for stable magnetic skyrmions.
475	<strong><strong>Composites of multiwall carbon nanotubes and conducting polyaniline: bulk samples and films produced  from a solution in chloroform</strong></strong>	Multiwall carbon nanotubes and conducting polyaniline, doped with dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, are blended by employing the solubility of both materials in chloroform. This method represents an alternative to <em>in-situ</em> polymerization of the conducting matrix in the presence of nanotubes, offering an appreciable versatility with regard to possible applications. In these composites, advantageous properties of carbon nanotubes can be utilized in fully conducting structures that are free of problems related to percolation charge transport, and the strong decrease of the conductivity of doped polyaniline at low temperatures is simultaneously suppressed. Pellets are made by pressing the dried powder of the obtained composite, and films by sedimentary deposition. The nanotube content in the pellets can be as high as 40% by weight, and this wide range leads to a control over the shape and magnitude of the conductivity versus temperature curves. As the nanotube content grows, the temperature dependence of the conductivity becomes less steep, which is similar to the effect of annealing temperature on the conductivity of certain polycrystalline graphene samples. In our case, this change is most likely caused by the increase of the density of highly conducting channels and not by homogeneous electron delocalization effects. A commercial printed circuit board is used as the substrate for film deposition, and the conducting properties of the composites do not degrade upon film deposition.
476	A Hybrid Sub-Gridding ADE-FDTD Method for Modeling Periodic Metallic Nanoparticle Arrays	In this paper, a modified sub-gridding scheme that hybridizes the conventional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method and the unconditionally stable locally one-dimensional (LOD) FDTD is developed for the analysis of periodic metallic nanoparticle arrays. The dispersion of the metal, caused by the evanescent waves propagating along the metal-dielectric interface, is expressed by the Drude model and solved with a generalized auxiliary differential equation (ADE) technique. In the sub-gridding scheme, ADE-FDTD is applied to global coarse grids while ADE-LOD-FDTD is applied to local fine grids. The time step sizes in the fine-grid region and coarse-grid region can be synchronized, obviating the temporal interpolation of the fields during the time-marching process. Numerical examples about extraordinary optical transmission through the periodic metallic nanoparticle array are provided to show accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.
477	Novel high temperature vacuum nanoindentation system with active surface referencing and non-contact heating for low thermal drift measurements	High temperature nanoindentation is an emerging field with significant advances in instrumentation, calibration and experimental protocols reported in the past couple of years. Performing stable and accurate measurements at elevated temperatures holds the key for small scale testing of materials at service temperatures. We report a novel high temperature vacuum nanoindentation system, High Temperature Ultra Nanoindentation Tester (UNHT3 HTV), utilizing active surface referencing and non-contact heating capable of performing measurements up to 800&#x1D3C;C. This nanoindenter is based on the proven Ultra Nano Hardness Tester (UNHT) design that uses two indentation axes: one for indentation and another for surface referencing. Differential displacement measurement between the two axes enables stable measurements to be performed over long durations. A vacuum level of 10-7 mbar prevents sample surface oxidation at elevated temperatures. The indenter, reference and sample are heated independently using integrated infrared heaters. The instrumental design details for developing a reliable and accurate high temperature nanoindenter are described. High temperature calibration procedures to minimize thermal drift at elevated temperatures are reported. Indentation data on copper, fused silica, epoxy and a hard coating show that this new generation of instrumented indenter can achieve unparalleled stability over the entire temperature range up to 800{degree sign}C with thermal drift rates of &lt; 3 nm/min at elevated temperatures.
478	<strong>Acoustic Wave Sparsely-Activated Localization Microscopy (AWSALM): Super-Resolution Ultrasound Imaging using Acoustic Activation and Deactivation of </strong><strong>Nanodroplets</strong>	Photo-activated localization microscopy (PALM) has revolutionized the field of fluorescence microscopy by breaking the diffraction limit in spatial resolution. In this study, &lsquo;acoustic wave sparsely-activated localization microscopy (AWSALM)&rsquo;, an acoustic counterpart of PALM, is developed to super-resolve structures which cannot be resolved by conventional B-mode imaging. AWSALM utilizes acoustic waves to sparsely and stochastically activate decafluorobutane nanodroplets by acoustic vaporization, and to simultaneously deactivate the existing vaporized nanodroplets via acoustic destruction. In this method, activation, imaging, and deactivation are all performed using acoustic waves. Experimental results show that sub-wavelength micro-structures not resolvable by standard B-mode ultrasound images can be separated by AWSALM. This technique is flow independent and does not require a low concentration of contrast agents, as is required by current ultrasound super resolution techniques. Acoustic activation and deactivation can be controlled by adjusting the acoustic pressure, which remains well within the FDA approved safety range. In conclusion, this study shows the promise of a flow and contrast agent concentration independent super-resolution ultrasound technique which has potential to be faster and go beyond vascular imaging.
479	Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> Thin Films Functionalized with Ag, Au and TiO<sub>2</sub> Analyzed Using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy	In the present contribution, bare and composite Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-X, with X = Ag, Au, or TiO<sub>2</sub>) thin films were fabricated by a two-step vapor-phase route, consisting in: <em>a)</em> the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> on Si(100) substrates starting from a Mn(II) fluorinated &beta;-diketonate diamine Mn(II) complex; <em>b)</em> the introduction of silver, gold or titania by means of Radio Frequency (RF)-sputtering. The obtained results evidenced the formation of phase-pure &alpha;-Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> thin films chemically modified with fluorine, which, after RF-sputtering, yielded Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-X nanocomposite systems with tailored properties. In this work, data obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization of the surface chemical composition are presented and discussed for bare and functionalized Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> systems. In addition to wide scan spectra, particular attention is dedicated to the analysis of C1s, O1s, Mn2p, Mn3s, F1s and, eventually Ag3d, Au4d<sub>5/2</sub>, and Ti2p core levels, as well as silver Auger signal. In the case of Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-Au system, a quantification procedure aimed at circumventing problems arising from the overlap of Mn2p/Au4p<sub>1/2</sub> and Mn3s/Au4f signals is proposed.
480	Effect of nanowire curviness on the percolation resistivity of transparent, conductive metal nanowire networks	We study the effect of nanowire curviness on the percolation resistivity of transparent, conductive metal nanowire networks by Monte Carlo simulations. We generate curvy nanowires as one-dimensional sticks using 3<sup>rd</sup>-order B&eacute;zier curves. The degree of curviness in the network is quantified by the concept of curviness angle and curl ratio. We systematically study the interaction between the effect of curviness and five other nanowire/device parameters on the network resistivity, namely nanowire density, nanowire length, device length, device width, and nanowire alignment. We find that the resistivity exhibits a power law dependence on the curl ratio, which is a signature of percolation transport. In each case, we extract the power-law scaling critical exponents and explain the results using geometrical and physical arguments. The value of the curl ratio critical exponent is not universal, but increases as the other nanowire/device parameters drive the network toward the percolation threshold. We find that, for randomly oriented networks, curviness is undesirable since it increases the resistivity. For well-aligned networks, on the other hand, some curviness is highly desirable, since the resistivity minimum occurs for partially curvy nanowires. We explain these results by considering the two competing effects of curviness on the percolation resistivity. The results presented in this work can be extended to any network, film, or nanocomposite consisting of one-dimensional nanoelements. Our results show that Monte Carlo simulations are an essential predictive tool for both studying percolation transport and optimizing the electronic properties of transparent, conductive nanowire networks for a wide range of applications.
481	All-optical nanoscale thermometry with silicon-vacancy centers in diamond	We demonstrate an all-optical thermometer based on an ensemble of silicon-vacancy centers (SiVs) in diamond by utilizing the sensitivity of the zero-phonon line wavelength to temperature, &Delta;&lambda;/&Delta;T = 0.0124(2) nm K<sup>-1 </sup>(6.8(1) GHz K<sup>-1</sup>). Using SiVs in bulk diamond, we achieve 70mK precision at room temperature with a temperature uncertainty &sigma;<sub>T</sub> = 360 mK/&radic;Hz. Finally, we use SiVs in 200 nm nanodiamonds as local temperature probes with 521 mK/&radic;Hz uncertainty and achieve sub-Kelvin precision. These properties deviate by less than 1% between nanodiamonds, enabling calibration-free thermometry for the sensing and control of complex nanoscale systems.
482	Surface-induced melting and solidification from a nanovoid: A study of sizeeffect using a phase field approach	The size effect and the effects of finite-width  surface on barrierless transformations between solid (S), surface melt (SM), and melt (M) from a spherical nanovoid  are studied using a phase field approach. Melting<br />(SM$\to$M and S$\to$M) from nanovoid occurs at significantly greater temperature than the solid-melt equilibrium temperature $\theta_e$. The relationship  for SM and M temperatures versus the ratio   of the void surface width and width of solid-melt interface, $\bar\Delta$,  is found for the nanovoids of different sizes.  Below a critical ratio $\bar\Delta^*$, the melting  occurs via SM and the melting temperature slightly reduces with an increase in $\bar\Delta$. Both S$\to$SM and SM$\to$M transformations have a jump-like character (excluding the case with the sharp void surface), causing small temperature hysteresis.  However,  the solid  melts without  SM for $\bar\Delta&gt;\bar\Delta^*$, and the melting temperature significantly increases with increasing $\bar\Delta$. The results for a nanovoid are compared with the melting/solidification of  a nanoparticle, for which the melting temperatures, in contrast, are much lower than $\theta_e$. A linear dependence of the melting temperatures with the inverse of the void radius is shown. The present study shows an unexplored way to control the  melting from nanovoids by controlling the void size and the width and energy of the surface.
483	Nansocale Schottky Barrier Visualization Utilizing Computational Modeling and Ballistic Electron Emission Microscopy	The electrostatic barrier at a metal semiconductor interface is visualized with nanoscale spatial and meV energetic resolution.  A combination of Schottky barrier mapping with ballistic electron emission microscopy (BEEM) and computational modeling enables extraction of the barrier heights, the hot electron scattering, and the presence of localized charges at the interface from the histograms of the spectra thresholds.  Several metal semiconductor interfaces are investigated including W/Si(001) using two different deposition techniques, Cr/Si(001), and mixed Au-Ag/Si(001).  The findings demonstrate the ability to detect the effects of partial silicide formation in the W and Cr samples and the presence of two barrier heights in intermixed Au/Ag films upon the electrostatic barrier of a buried interface with nanoscale resolution. This has potential to transform the fundamental understanding of the relationship between electrostatic uniformity and interface structure for technologically important metal semiconductor interfaces.
484	Optimized Trap-state Emission of Magic-sized CdSe Quantum Dots for Efficient White LEDs	Magic clusters have attracted significant interest to explore the dynamics of quantum dot (QD) nucleation and growth. At the same time, CdSe magic-sized QDs reveal broadband emission in the visible, which advantageously offer integration of a single-type of nanomaterial and high color rendering ability for white LEDs. Here, we optimized the quantum yield of magic-sized QDs via controlling the synthesis parameters without any shelling or post-treatment process and integrated them in liquid-state on blue LED to prevent the efficiency drop due to host-material effect. The fabricated white LEDs showed color-rendering index and luminous efficiency up to 89 and 11.7 lm/W.
485	Ultrafast Dynamic Response of Single-Crystal <em>beta</em>-HMX	We report experimental and computational studies of shock wave dynamics in single-crystal beta-HMX on an ultrafast time scale.  Here, a laser-based compression drive (~1 ns in duration; stresses of up to ~40 GPa) is used to propagate shock waves normal to the (110) and (010) lattice planes.  Ultrafast time-domain interferometry measurements reveal distinct, time-dependent relationships between the shock wave velocity and particle velocity for each crystal orientation, which suggest evolving physical processes on a sub-nanosecond time scale.  To help interpret the experimental data, elastic shock wave response was simulated using a finite-strain model of crystal thermoelasticity.  At early propagation times (&lt;500 ps), the model is in agreement with the data, which indicates the mechanical response is dominated by thermoelastic deformation.  The model agreement depends on the inclusion of nonlinear elastic effects in both the spherical and deviatoric stress-strain response.  This is achieved by employing an equation-of-state and a pressure-dependent stiffness tensor, which was computed via atomistic simulation.  At later times (&gt;500 ps), the crystal samples exhibit signatures of either inelastic deformation, structural phase transformation, or chemical reaction, depending on the direction of wave propagation.
486	<strong><em>Phase Retrieval for Near-field X-Ray Imaging beyond Linearisation or Compact Support</em></strong>	X-ray phase contrast imaging and tomography relies on phase retrieval to obtain sharp images of<br />micro- and nanoscale objects, with widespread applications in materials science and biomedical research.<br />For high resolution synchrotron experiments, phase retrieval is largely based on the single step reconstruction<br />using the contrast transfer function approach, as introduced almost twenty years ago \cite{Cloetens_Appl.Phys.Lett._1999}. <br />Notwithstanding its tremendous merits, this scheme makes stringent assumptions on the optical properties of the object, requiring in particular <br />a weakly varying phase. In this work we show how significant the loss in image quality becomes,<br />if these assumption are violated, and how phase retrieval can easily be rescued by a simple scheme of alternating projections. <br />Importantly, the approach demonstrated here uses the same input data and constraint sets as the conventional CTF-based phase retrieval.
487	Interfacial Properties of Polymeric Complex Coacervates from Simulation and Theory	Polymeric complex coacervation occurs when two oppositely-charged polyelectrolytes undergo an associative phase separation in aqueous salt solution, resulting in a polymer-dense coacervate phase and a polymer-dilute supernatant phase. This phase separation process represents a powerful way to tune polymer solutions using electrostatic attraction, and is sensitive to environmental conditions such as salt concentration and valency. One area of particular research interest is using this to create nanoscale polymer assemblies, via (for example) block copolymers with coacervate-forming blocks. Key to understanding coacervate-driven assembly is the formation of interface between the coacervate and supernatant phases, and its corresponding thermodynamics. In this work, we use recent advances in coacervate simulation and theory to probe the nature of the coacervate-supernatant interface. First, we show that self-consistent field theory (SCFT) informed by either Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations or transfer matrix (TM) theories is capable of reproducing interfacial features present in large-scale Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The quantitative agreement between all three methods gives us a way to efficiently explore interfacial thermodynamics. We show how salt affects the interface, and we find qualitative agreement with literature measurements of interfacial tension. We also explore the influence of neutral polymers, which we predict to drastically influence the phase behavior of coacervates. These neutral polymers can significantly alter the interfacial tension in coacervates; this has a profound effect on the design and understanding of coacervate-driven self-assembly, where equilibrium structure is tied to interfacial properties.
488	Enhanced photoresponse of Ge/Si nanostructures by combining amorphous silicon deposition and annealing	In order to inhibit high carrier recombination rates in Ge-on-Si nanostructures, Ge nanoislands were covered by thin amorphous silicon layers <em>via</em> a low pressure CVD process. The photovoltage magnitude of capped Ge/Si increased by an order of magnitude compared to that of bare Ge islands, which can be due to the effective passivation of recombination centers at the a-Si/Ge interface. The effect is even more enhanced by nearly 5 to 10 times after subsequent anneal at 400&ordm;C in O<sub>2</sub> ambient. The results are explained in terms of passivation properties of hydrogenated amorphous silicon films. This work will facilitate the optoelectronic applications of Ge/Si heterostructures, such as solar energy harvest and photodetectors.
489	<strong>Thermoluminescence and OSL study of   </strong><strong>BaMg<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>6</sub>Si<sub>9</sub>O<sub>30</sub>: Ce<sup>3+</sup></strong><strong>/ </strong><strong>Dy<sup>3+</sup> </strong><strong>phosphor</strong>	Series of nanosiezed BaMg<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>6</sub>Si<sub>9</sub>O<sub>30</sub> phosphor doped with  Ce<sup>3+</sup>/ Dy<sup>3+</sup>  were synthesized by the combustion technique. The phosphors was irradiated first by   Sr-Y90&beta;-emitting source and after that, it was used for the TL-OSL measurement.  Therefore BaMg<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>6</sub>Si<sub>9</sub>O<sub>30</sub> : Ce<sup>3+</sup>/ Dy<sup>3+   </sup>phosphor  shows an isolated glow curve doped at around 201<sup>0</sup>C. Further it was well resolved into two sub-bands  with the help of curve fitting a calculate the trap depth and TL parameters of the observed curve. Also,   OSL decay curve analysis was carried out for  BaMg<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>6</sub>Si<sub>9</sub>O<sub>30 </sub>:<sub>0.1</sub>Ce<sup>3+</sup>,<sub>y</sub>Dy<sup>3+ </sup>phosphor which was well fitted into third order exponential.  The micro and nanostructure of the phosphors materials were confirmed from the SEM, TEM  investigation. Again the phase purity of the materials is confirmed by XRD  which has the hexagonal structure and the observed diffraction pattern of the phosphor is well indexed and confirmed using  theoretical tools of  XRD  for a practical approach to calculate the lattice parameter. Thus prepared nanosized  thermoluminescent materials is a promising candidate, which may act as dosimeters for the irradiation of foods and seeds.
490	<strong>Strain-modulated dynamical stability and magnetic behavior of free standing Pt and Pd nanowires</strong>	We study the Lagrangian strain induced colossal magnetism and thermoelectric performance of platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd) nanowires (NWs) using first principles density functional calculations. Pt and Pd NWs are found to be dynamical stability in both strain-free and strained situation. The results show that the cohesive energy and magnetic moment of both NWs increases on increasing tensile Lagrangian strain (2% to 10%) in (001) plane. Furthermore, we analyze the thermodynamic properties using quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA), the heat capacity and internal energy for both the NWs originate at 0 K and the internal energy (E) remain high. NWs with (100) and (010) plane, the magnetism exists at strain free case, while increasing strain, the values of magnetism decreases rapidly. Our results show excellent stability, colossal magnetism, and thermoelectric properties of given NWs; therefore, these NWs can be used as a potential thermoelectric material for device applications.s<p><strong> </strong>
491	A Frank-Kasper Polyhedral Structure of 17-Atom Vanadium Clusters	A distorted Frank-Kasper polyhedral structure (A) as the putative global minimum was identified for the neutral and charged V17 clusters by using the Monte Carlo basin-hopping algorithm based on semi-empirical Gupta potential and density functional theory calculations. The cationic V17+ cluster reproduces well the experimental infrared multiple photon dissociation spectroscopy, and the calculated ionization potentials and electron affinities of the A structure are close to its experimental values. It is also found that the shell-closed V17+ structure can be stabilized by 20 delocalized 3c-2e and 4 delocalized 6c-2e &#x03C3; bonds on the outer shell and 12 delocalized 4c-2e &#x03C3; bonds on the inner shell. Our results represent an effective and reliable way to predict and design the novel building block of largely nanoscale materials, and facilitate the understanding of structural correlations on the energy landscapes.
492	Transient lattice deformations of crystals studied by means of ultrafast time-resolved x-ray and electron diffraction	Ultrafast lattice deformation of tens to hundreds of nanometer thick metallic crystals, after femtosecond laser excitation, was measured directly using 8.04 keV subpicosecond x-ray and 59 keV femtosecond electron pulses. Coherent phonons were generated in both single crystal and polycrystalline films. Lattice compression was observed within the first few picoseconds after laser irradiation in single crystal aluminum, which was attributed to the generation of a blast force and the propagation of elastic waves. The different time scale of lattice heating for tens and hundreds nanometer thick films are clearly distinguished by electron and x-ray pulse diffraction. The electron and lattice heating due to ultrafast deposition of photon energy was numerically simulated using the two-temperature model (TTM) and the results agreed with experimental observations. The ultrafast heating described by TTM was also discussed from an electrical circuit perspective, which may provide new insights on the possible connection between thermal and electrical processes. This study demonstrates that the combination of two complimentary ultrafast time-resolved methods, ultrafast x-ray and electron diffraction will provide a panoramic picture of the transient atomic motions and structure in crystals.
493	<em>k</em>-space optical microscopy of nanoparticle arrays: opportunities and artifacts	We report on  the  interesting possibilities offered by <em>k</em>-space optical microscopy for the study of periodic arrays of nanoparticles.  In this work,  several different illumination configurations using an inverted optical microscope are exploited. A recently reported artifact,  called the "condenser effect",  is demonstrated here in a new way. The consequences of this artifact (which is due to spurious reflections in the objective) on Fourier-space imaging and spectroscopic measurements are analyzed in detail. The fact that <em>k</em>-space optical microscopy may be used to resolve the surface-plasmon-polariton band structure in a periodic nanoparticle array on a metallic layer is demonstrated. Potential applications of <em>k</em>-space imaging for the accurate lateral and axial positioning of the sample in optical microscopy are investigated.
494	Stability of Nano Bubbles	With stable existence in liquids for over several weeks, nano bubbles have an extensive range of applications across many fields of science and engineering. For an effective and functional use of these bubbles, it is important to know the reason for their long term stability. Therefore, a comprehensive laboratory investigation was performed to determine bubble size distributions and zeta potentials of nano bubbles, first using four different gases in tap water and deionized water (test series I) and then using two gases in deionized water with different salt concentrations, pH levels and temperatures (test series II). Experimental results from test series I showed that the average bubble size depended on the gas solubility in water and zeta potential depended on the ability of the gas to generate OH- ions at the water/gas interface.  Experimental results from test series II showed that bubbles with high negative zeta potentials can be generated in solutions of high pH, low temperatures and low salt concentrations. The high pH solutions produced smaller but stable nano bubbles. The bubble diameter slightly increased with increasing salt concentration. However, the bubble size did not show considerable dependence on solution temperature. The long-term tests showed that with time zeta potential of bubbles decreased while the bubble size increased. Hence it is hypothesized that nano bubbles will grow with time and will eventually disappear.
495	Single molecule electrophoresis of star polymers through nanopores: Simulations	We study the translocation of charged star polymers through a solid-state nanopore using coarse-grained Langevin dynamics simulations, in the context of using nanopores as high-throughput devices to characterize polymers based on their architecture. The translocation is driven by an externally applied electric field. Our key observation is that translocation kinetics is highly sensitive to the functionality of the star polymer. The mean translocation time is found to vary non-monotonically with polymer functionality, exhibiting a critical value for which translocation is the fastest.  The origin of this effect lies in the competition between higher  driving force inside the nanopore and inter-arm electrostatic repulsion in entering the pore, as the functionality is increased. Our simulations also show that the value of the critical functionality can be tuned by varying nanopore dimensions. Moreover, for narrow nanopores, star polymers above a threshold functionality do not translocate at all. These observations suggest the use of nanopores as a high-throughput low-cost analytical tool to characterize and separate star polymers.
496	Morphology and optical properties of Eu&sup2;&#x207A;-sensitized CsI(Na) thick film	<SPAN style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Eu co-doping of CsI(Na) thick film was deposited by thermal evaporation on quartz substrate which was coated by a nano-reflective layer. Morphology and structure of these films which were studied, using SEM images and XRD pattern, had no distinguishable differences. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy ICP (OES) was utilized in order to measure Sodium and Europium concentration, along deposition. Moreover, their optical properties were investigated by UV absorption, excitation and emission spectroscopy in the wavelength region 200-800 nm. The results indicated that Eu-sensitizing material enhanced the luminescence intensity of CsI(Na) columnar-structure film, compared to conventional CsI(Na) scintillator. This increasing is attributed to the both Eu high quantum efficiency and energy transfer between the activator and sensitizer which is considered with a view of improving scintillator properties. Ion Beam Induced Luminescence (IBIL) measurements also confirm the luminescence results.</SPAN>
497	Enhanced optical response of crystalline silicon photovoltaics devices by integration of silver nanoparticles and ultrathin TiO2 dielectric&#x00A0;layer	Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) and titanium&#x00A0;dioxide (TiO2) dielectric layer, produced by magnetron sputtering and a subsequent annealing treatment, were integrated at the front side of crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells. A photovoltaics device was realized based on the c-Si substrate and a Ag NPs/TiO2/n/p/Ag layer stack. The results show that the energy conversion efficiency (ECE) can be improved by 9.9% due to introducing the well-sized Ag NPs and ultrathin TiO2 dielectric layer to the c-Si solar cells. The presence of the dielectric layer makes Ag NPs fully exert the advantage of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and light scattering, and the recombination of the photo-generated carriers originating from Ag NPs at the surface or in the vicinity of Ag NPs is avoided effectively. Moreover, COMSOL Multiphysics simulations were performed to investigate the reflection and absorption in the c-Si. The simulation results match well with the experimental data.
498	<strong>Synergistic effects on microstructural evolution and hardening of the Hastelloy N alloy under subsequent He and Xe ion irradiation</strong>	Synergistic effects in the evolution of He bubbles and dislocation loops in Hastelloy N alloy were investigated using transmission electron microscopy and nanoindentation. Results show that the sizes of both He bubbles and dislocation loops induced by the He<sup> </sup>and Xe irradiation were larger than those in the individual irradiation cases. The corresponding hardening degree of irradiated sample was also measured to be higher than the combined hardening value of two individual irradiation cases. The synergistic effects were explained by the pre-existed He bubbles that captured vacancies and thus inhibited their annihilation with interstitial atoms during the subsequent Xe irradiation.
499	Efficiency enhancement of flexible OLEDs by using nano-corrugated substrates and conformal Ag transparent anodes	In flexible OLEDs (FOLEDs), the traditional ITO anode has disadvantages such as refractive-index mismatches among substrate and other functional layers, leads to light loss of nearly 80%, meanwhile, the brittle nature and high cost of ITO anode hinder its future application in flexible devices. We investigated an efficient FOLED using a thin silver (Ag) anode, whereas the whole device was deposited on a nano-corrugated flexible polycarbonate (PC) substrate prepared by thermal nanoimprint lithography. The template for the nanoimprint process was a replicate of a silica nano-pillars array fabricated by inductively coupling plasma (ICP) etching through a mask of SiO2 colloidal spheres. The corrugations were well preserved on each layer of the device, both the micro-cavity effect and surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes of light loss were effectively suppressed. As a result, the current efficiency of the FOLED using a conformal corrugated Ag anode enhanced by 100% compared with a planar Ag anode device, and enhanced by 13% with conventional ITO device. In addition, owing to the quasi-periodical arrangements of the corrugations, the device achieved broad spectra and Lambertian angular emission. The Ag anode significantly improved the bending properties of the OLED as compared to the conventional ITO device, leading to a longer lifetime in practical use. The proposed manufacturing method will be useful for fabricating nano corrugation on plastic substrate of FOLED in a cost-effective and convenient manner.
500	<strong>Annealing effect on hierarchical structure of Ge ion implanted SiO<sub>2</sub><sup> </sup>matrix using multifractal technique</strong>	SiO<sub>2</sub> layers of thickness 200 nm were grown on Si substrates. Ge ions of 150 keV energy having fluences of 2.5&times;10<sup>16</sup> and 7.5&times;10<sup>16</sup> ions/cm<sup>2 </sup>were implanted into SiO<sub>2</sub> matrix. The implanted samples were annealed at 950<sup>o </sup>C for 30 minutes in Ar ambience. Due to the process of ion implantation of SiO<sub>2</sub> leads to amorphization, annealing is removing the disorder present in the system and amorphous phase changed to crystalline phase. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement was done to characterize the Ge nanostructures synthesized by implantation and annealing. Topographical studies of implanted as well as annealed samples were captured by the atomic force microscopy (AFM). Two dimensional multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (2D-MFDFA) based on the partition function approach was used to study the surfaces of ion implanted and annealed samples. The partition function is used to calculate generalized Hurst exponent with the segment size. Moreover, it is seen that the generalized Hurst exponents vary nonlinearly with the moment, thereby exhibiting the multifractal nature. The multifractality of surface is pronounced after annealing for the surface implanted with fluence ions/cm<sup>2</sup>.
501	<strong>Influence of the thickness of a nanometric copper interlayer on Au/dielectric thermal boundary conductance</strong>	The influence of a thin (1.5 - 30 nm) copper layer on the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) at the interface between gold and silicon, sapphire and diamond, respectively, was studied by Time Domain Thermoreflectance (TDTR). A monotonic increase of the TBC was observed over the first 10 nm, before reaching a plateau. In some cases, it was also observed that an interlayer reduced the TBC as compared to the reference system. This is rationalized by assuming that the TBC evolution as a function the interlayer thickness is controlled by i) a contribution of the gold layer that has to be taken into account for all phonons having a wavelength larger than the interlayer thickness and ii) a thickness-dependant resistance within the interlayer that appears when electron-phonon coupling is incomplete, i.e. typically over the first 10 nm. A model is proposed in which the gold layer resistance is estimated using a simple Debye approximation, while the resistance that appears within the interlayer is estimated by <em>g(T)</em> times <em>h</em> with <em>g(T)</em> the electron-phonon coupling factor and <em>h</em> the interlayer thickness. This results in a system with three resistances in series, i.e. the metal-metal and metal-dielectric interfacial resistances and the interlayer resistance, and a resistance in parallel, i.e. the gold layer resistance. Reasonably good agreement between this model and experimental data is observed.
502	<strong>Modification of alignment layer of TNLCD by doping ferroelectric ZnO nanoparticle for reducing switching voltage.</strong>	Twisted nematic liquid crystal device (TNLCD) was fabricated using ferroelectric ZnO doped polyimide alignment layer. Ferroelectric nanoparticle can produce local electric field and can trigger the orientation of  liquid crystal molecule and reduces the switching voltage. The  uniformly dispersion of ferroelectric ZnO  nanoparticles in the alignment layer was studied using scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The ferroelectric property of  ZnO doped polymide was investigated using dynamic contact electrostratic force microscopy (DC-EFM). An increased local electric field due to the presence of nano ZnO was confirmed with the help of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). An augmentation of capacitance was observed with increase in concentration, which substantiate the reduction of switching voltage of TNLCD with the modification of ferroelectric nanoparticle doped alignment layer.
503	<strong>Evaluation of the MWCNTs concentrations in Ag/TiO2 matrix by Raman spectroscopy and Gruneisen parameter</strong>	This research systematically investigated the functionalized Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (<em>f</em>-MWCNTs) by using the nitric and the sulfuric acids. Surface functionalization was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The <em>f</em>-MWCNTs-Ag-TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocomposites have been synthesized by using the chemical simple two-step method. To characterize the structural analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy were used. The results showed that both Ag and TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles were well-dispersed over the f-MWCNTs, so it caused to form a uniform nanocomposite. Raman spectroscopy was utilized for the estimation of the magnitude of strain by observing the shifts of the all bands of f-MWCNTs (especially G and 2G bands). The maximum Raman shift of f-MWCNTs is related to the G-band that peaks up-shifted from 2672 cm<sup>-1</sup> up to 2712 cm<sup>-1</sup> for 5 wt.% f-MWCNTs in TiO<sub>2</sub>-Ag matrix and becomes more broadening on the addition of f-MWCNTs up to 20% wt. The shift frequency of G-band indicates the strong interaction between f-MWCNTs and TiO<sub>2</sub>-Ag nanoparticles. So, it provides the mechanism for stress transfer at the interface between f-MWCNTs and TiO<sub>2</sub>-Ag nanoparticles that is pointed in the large increases in the mechanical and acoustical properties obtained.
504	<strong>Identification of Primary Nanoparticles, Their Aggregates and Agglomerates of Carbon-black in Suspension by Dynamic Ultrasound Scattering Techniques</strong>	Carbon black (CB) suspension exhibits various structures depending on the properties of solvent and dispersant as well as the preparation process of suspension. In most cases, they do not exist as independent nanoparticles but as aggregates or agglomerates. In order to evaluate the size distribution at different level of hierarchal structure, we carried out static/dynamic ultrasound scattering analysis for the CB suspensions in alcohol and/or water with or without Nafion, a perfluorinated polymer. The potential of the dynamic ultrasound scattering technique was demonstrated by discriminating diffusing nanoparticles and micron-sized aggregates/agglomerates without dilution of the sample. Particularly, suppression of large agglomerates by addition of Nafion was clearly observed. Phosphotungstic acid, a family of polyoxometalate, was also employed to obtain smaller unit structures of the CB particles without formation of aggregation after decomposition of CB. The effective catalysis was also confirmed by the dynamic ultrasound scattering technique.
505	<strong>Spatially Resolved Observation of Water Transport across Nanomembranes using Bright-field Nanoscopy</strong>	Gaining a detailed understanding of water transport behavior through ultra-thin membranes including atomically thin graphene layers is increasingly becoming necessary due to their potential applications in water desalination and ion separation. It is important to correlate the nanoscopic architecture of the membrane to the macroscopic properties such as the average water transport rate and the ion selective transport rates. Such correlations are only possible when spatially resolved (in the lateral direction) information of mass transport across the membrane is available. Current techniques do not provide spatially resolved information and only provide macroscopic parameters such as the bulk water transport rate. We describe a technique, referred here as Bright-Field Nanoscopy (BFN), which provides spatially resolved measurement of water transport across nanomembranes. Using this technique, we demonstrate how grain engineering of atomically thin chemical vapor deposited (CVD) graphene membranes can tune the bulk water transport rate across the membranes by orders of magnitude. BFN exploits the strong thickness dependent color response of an optical stack consisting of a thin (~25 nm) germanium film deposited over a gold substrate and only requires a regular bright-field microscope for data acquisition. To show the generality of this technique, we demonstrate the strong influence of the terminal layer on the bulk water transport rates in thin (~ 20 nm) layer-by-layer deposited polyelectrolyte multilayer films by exploiting the spatially resolved nature of the acquired data. We also show that by controlling the ambient conditions the effect of terminal layer can be completely suppressed.
506	Effect of Interfacial Stress in Phase Field  Approach for Martensitic Phase transformation in NiAl Shape Memory Alloy	A Phase-Field (PF) theory of phase transition between martensitic variants and twinning within martensitic<br />variants is presented with focus on effect of interfacial stress on Phase Transformations (PTs). In this theory, each variant-variant PTs and twinnings within each martensitic variant can be described by only one order parameter. Thus, it allows us to get analytical solution of the martensite--martensite interface energy and width. Moreover, this theory allows to introduce interface stresses consistent with the sharp interface limit. The finite element method is utilized to solve the coupled PF and elasticity equations for cubic to tetragonal PTs in NiAl shape memory alloy. The effects of interfacial stress are studied for both austenite-martensite and martensite-martensite interfaces. The stress fields are obtain and the effects of interfacial stress on stress field at interfaces are examined. Additionally, the stress as well as temperature induced growth of a martensitic phases inside austenite and martensitic PTs and twining are simulated. The evolution of microstructure and stress fields are obtained and the effects of interfacial stress on morphological evolution of martensitic nanostructures are examined. It is found that the interfacial stress is an important factor, influencing the stress distribution at interfaces and the phase field solution significantly. This theory can be extended for electric, reconstructive and magnetic PTs.
507	<strong>Kinetically Controlled Dewetting of Thin GaAs Cap from An ErAs/GaAs Nanoparticle Composite Layer </strong>	ErAs metal nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in GaAs have multiple applications in plasmonic, terahertz, and tunneling devices. Growing high quality thin GaAs layer over the ErAs NP layer is vital to these applications. In this work, we study the surface stability of GaAs thin cap (1 to 5nm) on single layer of ErAs NPs grown using molecular beam epitaxy in a GaAs matrix. As grown GaAs at low temperature (450&deg;C) can be smooth, however, GaAs was found to dewet from ErAs NP layer with increasing temperature (&gt;500&deg;C) through the formation of clumps or pinholes depending on the layer thickness. Thermodynamically, this dewetting is driven by the high interfacial energy as a result of different crystal structures, however, as a kinetic factor, surface mobility plays important roles in the process. It has been demonstrated that the dewetting can be prevented by combining a higher As overpressure, a low growth/annealing temperature, lower surface coverage of ErAs NP, and thicker GaAs cap.
508	<strong>Enhanced cycle stability of a NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanostructured electrode for supercapacitors fabricated by the alternate-dip-coating method</strong>	Nanostructured nickel cobalt sulfide (NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>) electrodes are successfully fabricated using a simple alternate-dip-coating method. The process involves dipping a TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles-covered substrate in a nickel/cobalt mixed precursor solution and sulfur precursor solution alternately at room temperature. The fabricated bimetallic sulfide electrode exhibits a synergetic improvement compensating for the disadvantages of the two single metal sulfide electrodes, <em>i.e.</em> the poor cycle stability of the nickel sulfide electrode and the low specific capacitance (<em>C</em><sub>sp</sub>) of the cobalt sulfide electrode. The two capacitive properties are optimized by adjusting the ratio of nickel and cobalt concentrations in the metal precursor solution, reaching a <em>C</em><sub>sp</sub> of 500 F/g at a current density of 1 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and its retention of 99.9 % even after 2000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles.
509	<strong>Marangoni flow and microstructure of electrode pattern in sintering process of Copper(I) oxide nanoparticle</strong>	Nanoparticle laser sintering is one of the key technology in additive manufacturing. Many kinds of process try to fabricate complicated part, such as free-form surface or seamless part but process resolution and quality are not satisfied with practical applications. Hence, laser sintering is applied to fabricate electrode pattern selectively for high precision manufacturing field. In spite of various advantages, the laser sintering process generate defects on the pattern and one of the major phenomenon is Marangoni flow. In this study, the laser sintering process was done to fabricate electrode pattern uniformly on substrate by suppressing the Marangoni flow and it was controlled by density of nanoparticle and laser characteristics, such as laser power, laser pulse duration, and laser scan speed. As a result, the Marangoni flow was figured out according to blending condition of the nanoparticle solution and laser irradiation parameter.
510	Optical Properties of Nanoporous Gold Foams	We fabricated and experimentally studied Au nano-foams and Al2O3 scaffolds filled with Au nanoparticles (NPs). We found that while the reflectance spectra of Au nano-foams depended very little on the 8-10 nm Al2O3 ALD coating, the spectra were highly sensitive to annealing, which increased the sizes of voids and ligaments from 50-100 nm to ~300 nm. The effective dielectric permittivities of the Au nano-foams and Al2O3 scaffolds with Au NPs were extremely high, ~50. Additionally, Au nano-foams covered with a dielectric (MgF2) featured bright structural colors, requiring the model, which extends beyond the effective medium approximation.
511	<strong>Induced-Charge Electrokinetics in Rotating Electric Fields: a Linear Asymptotic Analysis</strong>	Concerning the electroconvective analyte manipulation in microfluidics, we describe the basic physics of fluid flow driven by rotating induced-charge electro-osmosis (ROT-ICEO), which occurs on the planar surface of a single floating electrode in an external rotating electric field. First, based on a linear asymptotic analysis, the dynamic flow stagnation line in ROT-ICEO induced on the bipolar electrode from a <em>rotary Debye screening charge</em> revolves synchronously with the applied rotating fields. A net hydrodynamic torque is then generated that acts on any fluid or particle sample to produce either a synchronous or asynchronous co-field rotation depending on the frequency of the ac signal. Next, from the synergy between the hydrodynamic and electrochemical ion relaxations, an analytical solution of the sample rotation rate subject to ROT-ICEO slipping on an ideally polarizable surface is obtained for different frequency ranges and determined by the transient nature of the rotating electro-osmotic flow oscillating at twice the field frequency. To visualize the flow field in ROT-ICEO, experiments were performed with fluorescent tracer nanoparticles; they exhibited concentric rotational behavior at the polarized phase interface. Formed like the arms of a nebula disk, the four twisted tails of nanoparticles can be arbitrarily directed under voltage-phase rectification. These experimental results are in good agreement with our mathematical simulations using the Debye&ndash;H&uuml;ckel approximation on ROT-ICEO.
512	Carbide-derived carbons for dense and tunable 3D graphene networks	The mechanical properties of carbide-derived carbons (CDCs) are computed using molecular dynamics simulations, spanning the experimental density range and synthesis temperatures. The structures consist of nanoporous networks with continuous graphene walls enclosing the pores. Calculation of elastic constants and simulation of tensile strain reveal a direct relationship between microstructure and elasticity, with density and temperature inducing significant changes in the pore topology and medium-range order. CDCs have a high elastic moduli and high ultimate tensile strengths while showing resistance to brittle fracture. This suggests that CDCs are a promising route to achieve dense 3D graphene networks with tunable mechanical properties.
513	<strong>Motion Behavior of </strong><strong>Water Droplets</strong><strong> under Driving of Triboelectric Nanogenerator</strong>	By integrating a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and a simple circuit board, the motion of water droplet can be controlled by the output of the TENG, which demonstrates a self-powered microfluidic system toward various practical applications in the fields of microfluidic system and soft robotics. This paper describes a method to construct a physical model for this self-powered system on the basis of electrostatics induction theory. The model can precisely simulate the detailed motion behavior of the droplet under driving of TENG and it can also reveal the influences of surface hydrophobicity to the motion of the droplet, which can help us to better understand the key parameters that decides the performance of the system. The experimental observation of the dynamic performance of the droplet has also been done with a high speed camera system. A comparison between simulation results and real measurements confirms that the proposed model can predict the velocity and position of the water droplet driven by high voltage source as well as TENG. Hence, the proposed model in this work could serve as a guidance for optimizing the self-powered systems in future studies.
514	Thermochemical properties of nanometer CL-20 and PETN fabricated by mechanical milling methodology	2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), of which mean size were of 73.8nm and 267.7nm respectively, were fabrication upon a high-energy ball-mill. SEM analysis was employed to image the micron morphology of nano explosives, and the particle size distribution was calculated with statistic of individual particle size in SEM images. Analyses, such as XRD, IR, and XPS, were also enlisted to confirm whether the crystal phase, molecule structure, and surface elements were changed after a long time milling process. The results were as expected. Thermal analysis was performed at different heating rates. The parameters, such as activation energy (ES), activation enthalpy (&#x0394;H&#x2260;), activation free energy (&#x0394;G&#x2260;), activation entropy (&#x0394;S&#x2260;), and critical temperature of thermal explosion (Tb) etc, were calculated to depict the decomposition courses of the explosives. Moreover, thermal decomposition mechanism of nano CL-20 and nano PETN were investigated via DSC-IR analysis by which their gas products were also detected. The result indicated that nano CL-20 decomposed to CO2 and N2O and nano PETN decayed to NO2, which implied a remarkable difference on decomposition mechanism of two explosives. In addition, mechanical sensitivity of CL-20 and PETN were tested, and the results revealed that nano explosives were more insensitive than raw ones, and then the possible mechanism about this was discussed. Thermal sensitivity was also investigated with 5s bursting point test, and the 5s bursting point (T5s) and the activation of the deflagration were obtained.
515	<strong>Energy dissipation contributed on the machined depth via dynamic plowing lithography of AFM</strong>	In this study, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip-based dynamic plowing lithography (DPL) approach is employed to scratch on the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) thin-film surface. A theoretical model is established based on the relationship between the tip energy dissipation and material removal volume, and the corresponding experiments are also conducted. Both the theoretical and experimental results show that the drive amplitude is proportional to the square of the machined depth of the nanoscale grooves. The mean deviations between the predicted and experimental depths are less than 10%. It is also indicated that the scratching velocity in the range of 0.01-80 &mu;m/s is proportional to the square of the depth (1/<em>h<sup>2</sup></em>), and the mean deviations between the predicted and experimental depths are also less than 7%. In addition, based on the above conclusions, a uniform ripple with desired dimensions can be achieved successfully by overlapping the machined nanogrooves. The wavelength and amplitude of the ripples are determined by controlling the feature size of nanogrooves.
516	<strong>Enhanced room-temperature magnetoresistance in double-barrier graphene spin valves based on antiresonance effect</strong>	Use of a double-barrier spin valve with an armchair graphene nanoribbon to achieve huge tunnel magnetoresistance by an exceptional antiresonance effect is proposed. Compared with single-barrier spin valves, the tunnel magnetoresistance exceeds 10<sup>5</sup>% at room temperature due to the enhanced antiresonance effect in an antiparallel mode in the double-barrier junctions. It is noteworthy that these results can be attributed to a double-barrier design in which a transport gap in the energy interval restricts transmission. This unique mechanism leads to a strong suppression in the propagation of spin electrons. In particular, this phenomenon reveals that spin-polarized currents strongly depend on the thickness of the antiresonance cavity.
517	Study of the effect of osmotic pressure on the water permeability of Carbon-based Two-dimensional Materials	Two-dimensional materials such as graphene and carbon nanotube have promising applications in the preparation of permeable membranes and the field of environmental protection due to their unique structures and components. This paper conducts a study on graphene and nanotubes in salt solution using molecular dynamics computational method, and ascertains the quantitative relations between the ionic concentration, water flux and reverse osmosis pressure by setting up theoretical porous models of the two materials. This fundamental research provides much guidance in the determination of critical parameters like pressure and water flux in the actual application of membranes.
518	<strong>Secondary shock wave: </strong><strong>implication for laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry</strong>	Shadowgraphs of the dynamic evolution of nanosecond laser-induced ablation plumes outside of BCR-2G and BIR-1G geological standard samples at atmospheric pressure are captured. The model of the secondary shock wave is proposed and experimentally verified. Experimental results indicate that the secondary waves appear at 74 ns for BCR-2G and at 98 ns for BIR-1G samples, which result from the reflection of the backward moving gas on the sample surface. Under the same condition, the ablation threshold of the BCR-2G sample is lower than that of the BIR-1G sample. Furthermore, the ablation rate (crater depth per laser pulse) of BCR-2G sample is higher than that of BIR-1G sample. The secondary shock wave induces larger-diameter particles or clusters which have been regarded as a fractionation source. Debris redeposition plays role in the laser ablation and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The suppression of the secondary shock wave effect is possible with using low viscosity ablation gas which can expand the shock wave front leading less collision, aggregation of the ablated particles. As a result, the debris redeposition will be attenuated and the larger particles or clusters induced element fractionation can be expected to be suppressed in practice.
519	<strong>Structural and Magnetic property studies of 0-3 Magnetite-Poly(methyl methacrylate) Nanocomposites</strong>	Ultrafine superparamagnetic Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>(magnetite) particulate disperse in polymer matrix PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) are successfully synthesized through solution casting route. We have studies structure and phase of particulate and nanocomposites with x-ray diffraction (XRD) using by Rietveld analysis. The structure of particulate and nanocomposites can be described as a cubic structure with space group (<em>Fd</em> <em>m</em>). Microstructure and elemental composition are examined with the help of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) respectively. The characteristic functional groups of the polymer are detected from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The nanocomposites have tunable band gap energy properties decrease with increases of particulates magnetite in polymer, which determined by UV-spectroscopy. Magnetic measurements revealed superparamagnetic nature of the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles that also retained in the nanocomposites at room temperature and ferromagnetic at low temperature 5K. The blocking temperature (T<sub>B</sub>) of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>&ndash;PMMA nanocomposites was found to increase with superparamagnetic Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>nanoparticles content with a consistent decrease in saturation magnetization (M<sub>s</sub>) of nanocomposites. The M<sub>s</sub> value could also be estimated on the basis of TGA data, the M<sub>s</sub> values of different nanoparticle and nanocomposites calculated via TGA correlates well with those determined from VSM.
520	<strong>Matrix effect on order-disorder phase transition of FePt nanoparticles</strong>	A theoretical model is developed to systematically study the effect of the matrix to the order-disorder phase transition of FePt nanoparticles, which shows a significant role of the matrix or substrate to the ordering kinetics of FePt nanoparticles during the annealing process. It is shown that there exists a temperature window where one can obtain ordered FePt phase, while the high temperature limit with the largest nucleation rate is favorable for the formation of ordered FePt phase (L1<sub>0</sub>). The matrix or substrate not only reduces particle agglomeration and sintering, but also increases the high temperature limit as well as nucleation rate. Furthermore, the effect of the matrix to the ordering kinetics of FePt nanoparticles relies on its surface energy, the higher the surface energy of the matrix is, the more pronounced the effect is. The validity of the present model is supported by as well the explanations of the contradiction results as the good agreement between the model predictions and experimental data. Those findings are very interesting and crucial for practical application when synthesizing ordered FePt nanoparticles.
521	Seed Free Fabrication of High Quality MoS<sub>2</sub> Monolayer by Chemical Vapour Deposition	MoS<sub>2</sub> is a graphene analogue with exceptional properties for nano-era of semiconductor electronics. Here we report the large-scale synthesis of monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> onto SiO<sub>2</sub> substrate by seed promotor free CVD process. Piranha treatment reduces the surface free energy of the substrate, thus paving a way for controlled layered growth. Nucleation theory is explored to understand the growth of MoS<sub>2</sub> with and without Piranha treatment, respectively. Careful tracking of parameters, coverage of MoS<sub>2</sub> monolayer extends over centimetre scale with reproducibility. Our results confirm that piranha treatment provides an ideal platform for large scale monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> on different substrate for device applications.
522	Effect of phonon confinement on the thermal conductivity of In<sub>0.53</sub>Ga<sub>0.47</sub>As nanofilms	Over the past few decades, significant progress has been made to manipulate thermal transport in solids. Most of the effort has focused on reducing the phonon mean free path through boundary scattering. Herein, we demonstrate that the phonon confinement effect can also be used as a tool for managing thermal transport in solids. We measured the thermal conductivities of 10&ndash;70-nm-thick In<sub>0.53</sub>Ga<sub>0.47</sub>As nanofilms and found that the thermal conductivities decrease as the film thickness decreases. However, the reasons for this reduction differ for films with different thicknesses. The thermal conductivity of the 30- and 70-nm-thick In<sub>0.53</sub>Ga<sub>0.47</sub>As nanofilms decreases because of severe phonon boundary scattering. Our analysis indicates that phonon confinement occurs in the 10- and 20-nm-thick In<sub>0.53</sub>Ga<sub>0.47</sub>As nanofilms, which modifies phonon dispersion leading to changes in the phonon group velocity and the Debye temperature. These experimental and theoretical results could help to elucidate the phonon confinement effect in nanomaterials as well as establish a platform for understanding nanoscale thermal physics.
523	<strong>Phonon transport and scattering using modified BDE model coupled with temperature jump boundary condition in nano SiC MOSFET</strong>	In this work, we investigated the non-Fourier heat transfer in nano SiC devices. In the first step, we investigated the ability of our proposed model to describe the phonon scattering in 10 nm MOSFET devices. On the other hand, we studied the nano-heat conduction process in SiC nanodevices. The ballistic-diffusive equation (BDE) was numerically solved to assess the heat transport in the nano transistors. The proposed model is used to report the thermal conductivity through the nature of scattering mechanism. A size-dependent thermal conductivity model agrees with experimental results for silicon nanofilms. To clarify the nature of the phonon-wall collisions, we have considered the effect of the temperature boundary condition on the scattering interface. It is found that our predictive model is able to describe phonons scattering in MOS structures. Furthermore, the SiC MOSFET is more thermally stable than the Si MOSFET.
524	Acoustic funnel and buncher for nanoparticle injection	Acoustics-based techniques are investigated to focus and bunch nanoparticle beams. This allows to overcome the prominent problem of the longitudinal and transverse mismatch of particle stream and x-ray beam in single-particle/single molecule imaging at x-ray free-electron lasers (XFEL). It will also enable synchronized injection of particle streams at kHz repetition rates. Transverse focusing concentrates the particle flux to the (sub)micrometer x-ray focus. In the longitudinal direction, focused acoustic waves can be used to bunch the particle to the same repetition rate as the x-ray pulses. The acoustic manipulation is based on simple mechanical recoil effects and could be advantageous over light-pressure-based methods, which rely on absorption. The acoustic equipment is easy to implement and can be conveniently inserted into current XFEL endstations. With the proposed method, data collection times could be reduced by a factor of 10<sup>4</sup>. This work does not just provide an efficient method for acoustic manipulation of streams of arbitrary gas phase particles, but also opens up wide avenues for acoustics-based particle optics.
525	RHF and DFT  Study of the Molecular and Electronic  Properties of  (SiO2)n and (GeO2)n Nanoclusters	RHF and DFT computations of the molecular and electronic  properties of (SiO2)n and (GeO2)n nanoclusters with   are studied. Silicon dioxide clusters have higher thermal energies and lower average bond lengths and are thus  more stable than Germanium dioxide clusters.  At n=1,  both nanoclusters are non polar, but gradually become more polar with increase in n. The  average polarizability, molecular hyperpolarizability and total thermal energies of the nanoclusters increases with increase in molecular size. Computed values of the electron affinities for  (SiO2)n clusters agree with experimental results.
526	Walker-like breakdown in planar nanowires induced by a square impurity	The current-driven domain wall motion in a planar nanowire with a square impurity located at its center is studied by micromagnetic simulations. We show the existence of four regimes that depend both on the geometrical parameters of the impurity and the nanowire, as well as on the applied current density. These regimes determine a pinning-depinning pattern characterized by: i) the domain wall remains pinned in its initial position; ii) the domain wall is released from its initial position and reaches the square impurity, remaining pinned in that position; iii) the domain wall reaches the impurity and passes it without major obstacles, reaching the other end of the wire; iv) the domain wall reaches the impurity and suffers a series of complex transformations that annihilate it, giving rise to the nucleation of a new domain wall, which is what reaches the other end of the wire. Thus, we claim the existence of a Walker-like breakdown in planar nanowires induced by a square impurity. Our finding could be of practical use in the engineering of logic devices based on the movement of domain walls.
527	<strong>Synthesizing new glass 40P2O5 &ndash; 50BaO - 2.5Na2O &ndash; 2.5MgO - 5TiO2 for the application in high radiation environmental dosimetry</strong>	This paper aimed to present the thermoluminescence (TL) characteristics of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) nanopowders as a glass former, modified with barium oxide (BaO) glass. This mixture with activated with titanium oxide (TiO2), than co-activated with magnesium oxide (MgO) and sodium oxide (NaO). The glass was arranged into five different samples depending on the activator concentration and co-activator with the glass matrix 40 P2O5 - 50 BaO. The sample glass 40P2O5 &ndash; 50BaO - 2.5Na2O &ndash; 2.5MgO - 5TiO2 confirmed and proved the following properties: simple, reasonable, and modest way of synthesis, losing nearly about 18.57% from its TL information in 10 days, obvious glow curve shape, linear response, less fading, and high Zeff. Thus, this new formed kind of glass might play a very crucial role especially in the field of environmental dosimetry.
528	<strong>Enhanced Field Emission of Large Size Single-Layer Graphene Emitter Planted in Buffer Layer Substrates by Screen Printing</strong>	This report demonstrates an effective method to make large lateral size graphene for excellent field emission. The large size graphene oxide (GO) was obtained by exfoliating nanoscale expanded graphite and followed with frozen assisted gradient centrifugation. Most of large size GO sheets had their lateral size about 50 &mu;m and demonstrate high quality graphene structure with high 2D peak in Raman spectra after reduction. Mass producible screen-printing method was introduced to plant the reduced GO sheet (rGS) in buffer layer on silicon substrates. Results indicated the emitters made by high quality large size rGS had better performance field emission properties with lower turn-on field reduced from 4V/&mu;m to 0.4V/&mu;m and higher field emission current increased by more than ten times. This study confirmed that the electronic properties of rGS electrodes strongly depend on the lateral size of their precursor GO sheets. And the industrial printing approach will be essential for practical applications of rGS based electronic devices.
529	Controlling Spin Off State by Gas Molecules Adsorption on Metal-Phthalocyanine Molecular Junctions and Its Possibility of Gas Sensor	We present the electronic structure and transport properties of metal phthalocyanine (MPc) (M= Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) molecular junctions for four different gas molecules (NO, CO, O<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>) adsorbing on the M atom of MPc molecule, employing Green&rsquo;s function (GF) technique in combination with spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT). The adsorption configurations, adsorption energy, spin charge transfer and the corresponding transport properties of MPc (M= Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) molecular junctions with these gas molecules are systematically discussed in this work. Our results indicate that the gas adsorption can significantly modify the magnetic moment of MPc for M=Mn, Fe and Co. However, for M=Ni, Cu and Zn, gas adsorption is difficult to be detected due to weak van der Waals interaction between these gases and central M atom. Remarkably, the spin of MPc molecule can be switched to a magnetic off-state by specific gas absorption, giving rise to a potential application on controllable spintronic devices. In addition, CO, NO, O<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> gas molecules can be detected selectively by measuring spin filter efficiency of these MPc molecular junctions. On the basis of our results, MPc (M= Mn, Fe, Co) molecular junctions can be considered as a promising nanosensor device to detect individual gas molecules.
530	Atomistic Calculations of Surface Modification in Graphene Coated Copper Electrodes by Energetic Incident Carbon Atoms	Thin nanoscale coating of metal electrodes by graphene promises to be a useful approach in suppressing secondary electron yield.  Recent calculations showed reductions by as much as 50 percent for graphene over copper electrodes for energies below 125 eV, with the results in agreement with experimental data.  Here the robustness and resistance to possible degradation, in response to incoming atomic projectiles, is gauged based on Molecular Dynamics simulations.  Our results for surface irradiation by carbon atoms (as an example) on a nanoscale graphene coatings indicate a defect threshold of about 35 eV, lower surface damage for thicker layers, negligible sputtering and defects less than 6 Angstroms in dimension for energies up to 300 eV.
531	<strong>Phonon-glass-electron-crystal behavior in nanocrystalline Ni doped CoSb<sub>3</sub> skutterudites</strong>	We report the phonon-glass-electron-crystal behavior in Ni doped CoSb<sub>3</sub> skutterudites with Dy partically filled (Dy<sub>0.1</sub>Co<sub>1-x</sub>Ni<sub>x</sub>Sb<sub>3</sub> (x=0, 0.1, 0.2)). The samples are processed by one step solid-state synthesis route. The structural analysis of the samples using X-ray diffraction reveals the existence of single phase in all the samples irrespective of Ni concentration. Microstructure study using transmission electron microscopy shows the existence of nanometer size grains and the grain size varies between 40 nm to 100 nm. Power factor of Dy<sub>0.1</sub>Co<sub>0.8</sub>Ni<sub>0.2</sub>Sb<sub>3</sub> samples is enhanced to 7.1 mW/mK<sup>2</sup>, which is the highest power factor in doped ternary skutterudites reported so far. The enhancement of the power factor is due to the substantial reduction in electrical resistivity with increase in Ni concentration at higher temperature. Lattice thermal conductivity is drastically reduced to 0.26 W/mK at 773 K in Dy<sub>0.1</sub>Co<sub>0.8</sub>Ni<sub>0.2</sub>Sb<sub>3 </sub>sample. As a result, a huge increase in figure of merit (ZT~ 1.8) at 773 K is observed in Dy<sub>0.1</sub>Co<sub>0.8</sub>Ni<sub>0.2</sub>Sb<sub>3</sub> sample, the highest among the single elemental filled CoSb<sub>3</sub> skutterudites reported so far at this temperature. Hence, Ni doping acts as phonon-glass-electron-glass phenomena in Dy partially filled CoSb<sub>3</sub> skutterudites. This can be taken as reference to synthesize CoSb<sub>3</sub> skutterudite thermoelectric materials having higher figure of merit.
532	Defects characterisation studies and exploration of europium substitution effects in nanocrystalline bismuth ferrite through positron annihilation and other methods	A detailed study of the origin and role of structural defects on the effects of Eu<sup>3+</sup>-substitution(<em>x</em> = 0.0, 0.05,&hellip;, 0.3) in place of Bi<sup>3+</sup> in Bi<sub>1-<em>x</em></sub>Eu<em><sub>x</sub></em>FeO<sub>3 </sub>nanocrystalline multiferroic perovskite samples is presented. The samples were synthesized through the normal sol-gel route and characterised by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Further, UV-Vis absorption studies enabled the measurements of the band gap, which showed a continuous decrease on increased substitution. The phenomenon indicated the creation of defects-induced energy levels in the band gap closer to the conduction band. Positron annihilation spectroscopy is used in the identification of the structural defects in the crystallites. The studies revealed high concentrations of trivacancy-type defects within the Bi<sub>1-<em>x</em></sub>Eu<em><sub>x</sub></em>FeO<sub>3</sub>nanocrystallites. The transformation from the distorted rhombohedral structure to an orthorhombic configuration with an accompanying lattice contraction at <em>x</em>&gt; 0.2 influenced the positron lifetimes and the intensities. Substitution also helped in the cancellation of pre-existed vacancies through recombination with the doped ions. The measured positron lifetimes also indicated a fraction of the positrons annihilating from the nanocrystallite surfaces. Coincidence Doppler broadening measurements supported the transformation taking place during the substitution process and further identified the cationic vacancies as the predominant defects. The studies were found justified in the magneto-electric voltage measurements under a.c. magnetic fields of different strengths, all of which peaked at <em>x</em> = 0.2 and then decreased concomitantly with the transformation of the crystallites to the orthorhombic structure.
533	A micro Dalton resolution mass sensor with levitated nanodisks by the scenario ofmeasuring after cooling at room temperature	We propose a mass sensor using optically trapped and cooled dielectric nano disks with "measuring<br />after cooling" scheme. The center-of-mass motion of a trapped particle in vacuum can experience<br />extremely low dissipation resulting in robust decoupling from the heat bath. Thus the ground state<br />measurement can be accomplished in a short time after the optomechanical cooling is nished. This<br />method can lead to 10^-6 &#x0018; 10^-7 Dalton mass sensitivity which is a thousand times smaller than<br />the mass of one electron.
534	Enhancement of overall thermal conductance in a rectangular microchannel heat sink: evolutionary behavior of nanofluids and micro pin fins	Here we show that the overall thermal conductance in a rectangular microchannel heat sink can be maximized with which combinations of the volumetric ratios of nanofluids and micro pin fins. Fluid flow is driven by the pressure difference in between the inlet and outlet of the channel, and the dimensionless pressure difference defined as Bejan (Be) number. Here we uncover the effect of both micro pin fins and nanofluids separately and simultaneously in order to uncover their effect on the thermal conductance (i.e., thermal resistance). Both nanofluids and micro pin fins decrease the thermal resistances due to high thermal conductivity values of solids and increase the heat transfer surface area of the solid particles interacting with the fluid. However, the pumping power (pressure drop) increases in both cases due to the increase in the resistances to the fluid flow. The results documented what should be the solid nanoparticles volume fraction mixed into the base fluid and the solid volume fraction for the micro pin fins in order to minimize thermal resistances. The effect of the number of micro pin fins and their position along the microchannel on the thermal conductance are also documented. If the thermal conductivity of the nanoparticles is lower than the thermal conductivity of the fins, only fins maximize the thermal conductance for low Be numbers, and nanofluids maximize it for high Be numbers. This behavior analogous to an evolutionary concept where fins should dissolve in time to enhance thermal conductance similar to erosion in river beds.
535	Effects of electron-electron interaction on the collinear indirect exchange coupling in graphene nanoflakes	Using the Hubbard model in the framework of the tight-bonding<br />formulation, We study the effects of the electron-electron (e-e) interaction on the<br />indirect magnetic exchange coupling between the magnetic impurities embedded<br />in triangular graphene nanoflakes.The results show that the magnitude of the<br />coupling enhances in the presence of the e-e interaction and Rashba spin-orbit<br />interaction(RSOI). Also, the RKKY coupling magnitude depends on the impurity<br />positions in nanoflake and the size of the system
536	<strong>Tuning the electronic &amp; magnetic properties of graphene/<em>h</em>-BN hetero nanoribbon:</strong><strong> a</strong><strong></strong><strong> first-principles investigation</strong>	The successful synthesis of phase separated in plane graphene/<em>h</em>-BN hetero structures encourages to design one dimensional graphene/<em>h</em>-BN hetero nanoribbon (G/BNNR). Using first-principles density functional based approach, the electronic and magnetic properties of the hybrid ribbons with monohydrogenated edges have been investigated for different configurations with alternative composition of C-C and B-N units in a ribbon of fixed width. The lresult suggests that the electronic as well as magnetic properties of the ribbons can be regulated by the number of C-C (or B-N) units present in the structure. Both the hetero nanoribbons, either with N or B terminated edges, undergo a semiconductor-to-semimetal-to-metal transition with the increase in C-C units for a fixed ribbon width. The spin density distribution shows that significant localization of the magnetic moments is observed at the edge carbon atoms and arises when the number of C-C units is greater than 2 for most of the structures.
537	Nonlinear waves in a model for silicate layers	Some layered silicates are composed of positive ions, surrounded by layers of ions with opposite sign.  Mica muscovite is a particularly interesting material, because there exist fossil and experimental evidence for  nonlinear excitations transporting localized energy and charge along the cation rows within the potassium layers.  This evidence suggest that there are different kinds of excitations with different energies and properties. Some of the authors proposed recently a model based in physical principles and the silicate structure. The main characteristic of the model is that it has a hard substrate potential and two different repulsion terms, between ions and nuclei.  In a previous work with this model,  it was found the propagation of crowdions, i.e., lattice kinks in a lattice with substrate potential that transport mass and charge. They have a single specific velocity  and energy coherent with the experimental data. In this paper we perform a much more thorough search for nonlinear excitations using the pseudospectral method to obtain exact nanopteron solutions, that is single kinks with tails, crowdions and bi-crowdions. We analyze their velocities, energies and stability or instability and the possible reasons for the latter. We relate the different excitations with their possible origin from recoils from different beta decays and with the fossil tracks.  We  explore the consequences of some variation of the physical parameters because their values are not perfectly known. Through a different method, we also have found breathers, that is, localized nonlinear excitations with an internal vibration. They have small amplitude and energy, which is also coherent with the fossil evidence.
538	Symmetry changes during relaxation process and pulse discharge performance of the BaTiO<sub>3</sub>-Bi(Mg<sub>1/2</sub>Ti<sub>1/2</sub>)O<sub>3</sub> ceramic	Lead free relaxor ferroelectrics have attracted continued interests due to their outstanding and eco-friendly properties. In this paper, dielectric relaxation behavior of the 0.6BaTiO<sub>3</sub>-0.4Bi(Mg<sub>1/2</sub>Ti<sub>1/2</sub>)O<sub>3</sub> ceramic (BT-40BMT), which is a typical lead free relaxor ferroelectric, is theoretically and experimentally investigated. At first, the observed dielectric relaxation was quantitatively characterized by a novel statistical model, indicating that the minority co-related polar nano regions (PNRs) dominate the total polarization. Kinetics of the PNRs was subsequently studied by micro-Raman measurements performed at various temperatures. Here, the relaxation of written domains formed by the piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) tip-bias induced electric field was also studied, which describes the polarization retention performance of BT-40BMT. Absence of ferroelectric signal contribution in local switching was also confirmed by the contact mode kelvin PFM technique, indicating the lack of local ferroelectricity. Moreover, temperature insensitive energy storage property from 293 K to 443 K was obtained. High voltage pulsed discharge behavior was also investigated by using the pulsed current. A power density of 7.9&times;10<sup>8</sup> W/kg is obtained under a pulsed voltage of 50 kV. Combined with the fast discharge time, the 0.6BaTiO<sub>3</sub>-0.4Bi(Mg<sub>1/2</sub>Ti<sub>1/2</sub>)O<sub>3</sub> ceramic is considered as a candidate material for high voltage pulse power applications.
539	<strong>Vortex dynamics </strong><strong>over an airfoil</strong> <strong>controlled by</strong><strong> nanosecond pulse discharge plasma actuator</strong>	This paper presents the vortex dynamics of flow reattachment on a NASA SC (2)-0712 airfoil by a nanosecond pulse dielectric barrier discharge (NS DBD) actuator at a Reynolds number of 1&times;10<sup>5</sup>. The two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations are solved, and a source term on the right-hand side of the governing fluid energy transport equation is incorporated. The experimental results are well-predicted by computations, where the NS DBD actuator discharge produces a pressure wave with a velocity of 342 m/s and near surface thermal perturbations. Both experimental and computational results indicate that the NS DBD actuator introduces a series of vortexes into the shear layer. In turn, those vortexes promote the mixing of the shear layer, which results in separated flow reattachment. The two-dimensional vorticity evolution equation demonstrates that the vorticity is produced due to the intersection of density and pressure surfaces after plasma discharge. This vorticity advects downstream quickly via local flow velocity. The phase time flow results suggest the mechanism of NS DBD for flow control is the heating effect, which changes the local temperature and density and later induces vortex structures. The vortex structures entrain the outer high-momentum fluid into the shear layer and enhance the turbulent kinetic energy and kinetic energy at the leeward of the wing, thereby strengthening the mixing of the shear layer with the main flow, thereby promoting the separated flow reattachment.
540	<strong>Scale Effect of 6T-SRAM Cell in Nano-scale Technology</strong>	Degradation of the performance of the integrated circuit is introduced by the so-called scale effect when the feature size is reduced down to nanometer level. The scale effect can deteriorate the read stability and write ability of the static random access memory (SRAM). Therefore, it is important to investigate the scale effect of the SRAM cell at nano-scale technology. In this paper, the scale effect of the conventional 6T SRAM cell is discussed with the technology node varying from 90 nm down to 7 nm. The static noise margins (SNM) at the different technology nodes are extracted by using butterfly curves approach. The scale effect on the stability of the SRAM is analyzed based on the relationship between the simulated SNM values and the corresponding technology nodes. The physical mechanism of the scale effect of the SRAM cell is also discussed. It shows that the short channel effect appears and even dominates when the technology node shrinks down to nanoscales. In this manner, the traditional carrier transfer theory is no longer applicable. Because of the leakage current and transmission scattering operation, degradation of the SNM of the SRAM cell appears. An approach for optimization of the scale effect of the SRAM in nano-scale technology is proposed in the paper.
541	Bending deformation behavior of Zr65Cu17.5Ni10Al7.5 bulk metallic glass with different solidification cooling rate	In order to further clarify the relationship between the free volume and bending plasticity, the bending properties of Zr65Cu17.5Ni10Al7.5 bulk metallic glass (BMG) samples with different thicknesses corresponding to different solidification cooling rates were investigated. The results show that the bending plasticity of Zr65Cu17.5Ni10Al7.5 BMG decreases with the decrease of cooling rate, which is consistent with the evolution of shear bands density revealed by the investigation of microstructure. These phenomena are mainly attributed to the decrease of free volume content with the decrease of cooling rates, although the increase of nanocrystallization fraction. These results further confirm that free volume plays an important role in the deformation process of the BMGs.
542	<strong>Molecular dynamics study of defects and dislocations behaviour during tensile deformation of copper-silver core-shell nanowires with varying core diameter and shell thickness</strong>	Core-shell type nanostructures have drawn much attention among material researchers as they exhibit exceptional properties due to their unique structure. Among different core-shell nanostructures, copper-silver core-shell nanostructures are widely investigated in recent days for exhibiting different unique properties like very high mechanical strength. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to investigate the underlying deformation mechanism during tensile testing of copper-silver core-shell nanowire with varying core diameter and shell thickness. The Wigner-Seitz defect analysis was used to calculate the total number of point defects like vacancies and interstitials during the entire deformation process. The type, number and total length of dislocation segments were thoroughly investigated throughout the different stages of deformation. The effect of varying core diameter and shell thickness on the defects and dislocations configuration were also studied. Thus this study helps us to understand the underlying mechanisms or factors that contribute to the ultra-high strength and mechanical properties of Cu-Ag core-shell nanowires with varying core diameter and shell thickness.
543	Optical trapping of ultrasmooth gold nanoparticles in liquid and air	Optical manipulation of gold nanoparticles has emerged as an exciting avenue for studies in nanothermometry, cell poration, optical binding and optomechanics. However, conventional gold nanoparticles usually depart from a spherical shape, making such studies less controlled and leading to potential artifacts in trapping behavior. We synthesize ultrasmooth gold nanoparticles, which offer improved circularity and monodispersity. In this article, we demonstrate the advantages of such nanoparticles through a series of optical trapping experiments in both liquid and air. Compared to their conventional counterparts, ultrasmooth gold nanoparticles exhibit up to a three-fold reduction in standard deviation for trap stiffness measurements both in liquid and air and thus offer more controlled studies of plasmon mediated light-matter interactions.
544	Structural, Optical and Luminescent Properties of Antimony Doped ZnO Nanowires	We synthesized Sb-doped ZnO (ZnO:Sb) nanowires with varying Sb content and carried out a systematic study on their structural, optical and photoluminescent properties. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a hexagonal morphology of the as grown wires, while the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Ultra Violet -Visible spectroscopy results indicated the incorporation of Sb dopants into the ZnO lattice. XPS and x-ray diffraction analysis revealed that all ZnO:Sb nanowires with different Sb doping possessed typical wurtzite structure and had no other impurity phases. Furthermore, the XPS results showed that Sb ions are in an oxidation state between 3+ and 5+, indicating the existence of the (Sb<sub>Zn</sub>-2V<sub>Zn</sub>) acceptor complex in the ZnO:Sb nanowires. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements confirmed the formation of shallow acceptor levels in the ZnO:Sb nanowires. PL measurements at Low temperature showed strong violet luminescence, which is originated from free-electron to acceptor level (FA) transitions. The FA emission showed a slight blue shift with the increase of the temperature. As a result of Sb incorporation into the ZnO lattice, we observed a red shift in the ZnO:Sb nanowires energy gap with the increase of Sb doping. This red shift is attributed to the formation of acceptor levels inside the ZnO band gap. The identification of this acceptor level in these single-phase Sb doped ZnO nanowires provides strong promise of p-type conductivity of ZnO by Sb doping.
545	<strong>Decouple the Effects of Surface Structure and Intrinsic Wettability on Boiling Heat Transfer<sup></sup></strong>	Surface structure and intrinsic wettability are both important for boiling heat transfer. While superhydrophilic micro, nano and hierarchical surfaces are widely used for boiling enhancement, the surface structure and intrinsic wettability are usually coupled together. This study aims to decouple their effects on boiling heat transfer. Copper meshes are utilized as the microporous structures, and conformal superhydrophilic films are deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) of TiO<sub>2</sub>. Although ALD coatings for boiling have been done on flat surfaces, our study separates the effect of surface structure from that of intrinsic wettability on a three-dimensional (3D) microporous surface. By comparing two and four layer meshes, we show that the surface structure has no obvious effects on the critical heat flux (CHF), but can significantly enhance the heat transfer coefficient (HTC). The intrinsic superhydrophilicity dramatically increases the CHF due to the fast rewetting of dryout domains. Our conclusion is that fast rewetting is critical to increase CHF, while large exposed surface areas are vital to enhance HTC.
546	Density-functional study of hydrogen cyanide adsorption on silicene nanoribbons	Adsorption of toxic hydrogen cyanide gas (HCN) on armchair silicene nanoribbons (ASiNRs) is investigated by first principles method using density functional theory (DFT) to compute geometric, electronic and transport properties. Two variants of ASiNRs are considered: pristine ASiNR (P-ASiNR) and defective ASiNR (D-ASiNR), which is created by introducing a vacancy in P-ASiNR by removal of a Si atom. Total energy optimizations are used to find the most stable structures. The calculated results reveal that although HCN is physisorbed in both variants, sensitivity in case of D-ASiNR is sufficiently enhanced owing to more adsorption energy and charge transfer between the ASiNR-gas complex. Also the inspection of current-voltage characteristics demonstrates that the introduction of defect has considerably increased the conductivity of ASiNR. Hence, D-ASiNR may be used as a promising sensor for HCN gas.
547	Bubble dimer dynamics induced by double laser beam ablation in liquid	An approach based on double laser beam ablation in liquid is presented for the preparation of polymetallic nanoparticle colloids. The dynamics of double laser-induced bubble dimer is studied by the combination of an inviscid Rayleigh-Plesset model, ultrafast camera, and time-resolved shadowgraph experiments. It indicates that the bubble-pair will rapidly merge into a dimer and then undergo symmetric evolution as a single bubble, which can promote the agglomeration of different kinds of metal particles in this thermodynamic environment. Moreover, the atomic ratio of polymetallic compound with high crystallinity can be precisely adjusted by double laser energy ratio without any additives.
548	High-frequency soft magnetic properties of Co&ndash;SiO<sub>2</sub> nano-granular films with large out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy	For their use as flexible frameworks in high-frequency electromagnetic devices, soft magnetic thin films must have a high permeability <em>&mu;</em> up to frequencies of the order of tens of GHz and must overcome directional limitations. In this study, we demonstrate full in-plane, high-frequency, soft magnetic performances of Co<sub>x&middot;</sub>(SiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>1-x</sub> nano-granular films with large out-of-plane anisotropy. For a film with Co concentration <em>x</em> = 0.52, we obtained a high value <em>&mu;</em> = 4 up to the resonance frequency of 13 GHz for every direction in the film plane. The full in-plane permeability and resonance frequency are respectively about double and five times higher than those of conventional in-plane uniaxial magnetically anisotropic or stripe-domain type soft magnetic films. The fine magnetic-maze-domain structure that we observed using magnetic force microscopy was unaffected by the application of an external magnetic field. Both the large out-of-plane anisotropy fields of a few thousand Oe and the negligibly small remnant magnetization contribute to producing a resonance frequency greater than 10 GHz and to enable magnetically isotropic conditions in the film plane, with high reversibility in external magnetic fields. Our film with the large out-of-plane anisotropy promises to be a useful material for applications in fully directional and flexible designs of electromagnetic devices.
549	<strong>Photocurrent enhancement in metal-semiconductor-metal based broadband absorbers with double Schottky barriers</strong>	We experimentally report improved photocurrent performance under the illumination of both UV and visible light in the metal-semiconductor-metal nanostructures with double Schottky barriers, consisting of a monolayer of Au nanoparticles and a planar Au film separated by a thin WO<sub>3</sub> layer. We demonstrate that the near-unit broadband optical absorption causing the increased population of the hot electrons together with the occurrence of electron trapping effect at the bottom Schottky barrier are responsible for the photocurrent enhancement under visible illumination. Under the direct UV band-gap excitation of WO<sub>3</sub>, the electron trapping effect at the bottom barrier plays a crucial role in the anodic photocurrent enhancement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by replacing the Au film with the metal Pt of higher work function to increase the barrier height of the bottom Schottky barrier, and hence strengthening its ability for electron trapping, the photocurrent can gain a further significant enhancement under both the visible and UV illuminations.
550	<strong>Synthesis and optical properties of Co<sup>2+</sup>-doped ZnO Network prepared by new precursors </strong>	Pure ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) and Co/ZnO alloy NPs were synthesized with different percentages of cobalt impurity (1%, 3%, 5%, and 25%) with new precursors through the coprecipitation method. The structural results of the XRD analysis indicated that the pure and impure samples have a wurtzite hexagonal structure such that with an elevation of Co impurity up to 1%, the size of the nanocrystals declines by up to 30 nm. Furthermore, the FESEM analysis results suggest the homogeneity of the NPs such that with increased cobalt impurity, its level declines. The TEM analysis results revealed that the NPs with 5% impurity have a mean size of 32 nm in spherical form. The FTIR optical analysis results suggest a very sharp absorption peak within the wavelength ranges of 434&ndash;448 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>, belonging to the Zn-O vibration bond. In addition, the absorption peak developed at the wavelength of 3428 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> is related to the activation of the OH radicals, whose absorption value grows with the addition of an impurity, thereby, causing enhanced photocatalytic activity. The UV-DRS optical analysis indicated that the absorption wavelength grows with increased impurity, causing the development of redshift and a reduction of the energy band gap. In this regard, for the pure sample, the band gap value was 3.18 eV, while for the sample with 5% impurity, the band gap was obtained as 2.68 eV. The VSM magnetic analysis suggests ferromagnetic development in the impure sample, with a saturation magnetism of 16 memu/g and a coercivity field of 342 G.
551	Effect of MWCNT-Fe3O4/Water Hybrid Nanofluid on the Thermal Performance of Ribbed Channel with Apart Sections of Heating and Cooling	A Two-dimensional (2D) numerical simulation is performed to simulate the laminar forced convection of a nanofluid in a ribbed channel with apart heating (cooling) sources using lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The multi-wall carbon nanotubes-iron oxide nanoparticles/water hybrid nanofluid (MWCNT-Fe3O4/water hybrid nanofluid) is used in this simulation.  The velocity field, temperature distribution and heat transfer rate are numerically analyzed with the streamlines and isotherm patterns by means of a house-code. Also, the effect of Reynolds number (Re=25, 50, 75 and 100), nanoparticle solid volume fraction (&#x03D5;=0, 0.001, 0.003) and ratio of the blocks height (A=0.2, 0.3, 0.4) are measured in this paper. The computational method is validated against the results reported in the literature and a good agreement is reported. The obtained results show a maximum value of 16.49% increase in average heat transfer coefficient for all the considered cases relative to the base fluid. Moreover, the local Nusselt number proves that the use of blocks on the channel walls can increase the amount of heat transfer. Finally, average Nusselt number shows a linear dependence on the increasing ratio of  blocks height for constant solid volume fraction. The results of this study are applicable to the industrial equipment heating and cooling applications.
552	<strong>Hydrothermally synthesized Zn rich novel ZnO nanostructures for development of high responsivity deep UV photo-detectors</strong>	ZnO is a well-known material for near UV light detection, however its near UV absorption limits its potential for making it a candidate for deep UV range. Although Mg doped ZnO and integration of ZnO with materials like Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has been used to cover deep UV region. Nevertheless, pristine ZnO nanostructures synthesized by hydrothermal technique, have never been used for deep UV detection. Here, in this letter, we have engineered the absorption spectra of ZnO in the deep UV region by intentionally incorporating only Zn atoms. Tri-Sodium citrate (Na<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) has been used both as surfactant for fabricating honeycomb nanostructures as well as a reducing agent to incorporate Zn in ZnO nanostructures. The high absorption coefficient of Zn in deep UV region facilitates high photo-responsivity in this region of electromagnetic spectrum. Compared to relatively common ZnO nano-rods, honeycomb nanostructures exhibits ~3 order of magnitude lower dark current and ~2 orders of magnitude higher photo-current. The measured photosensitivity in honeycomb nanostructure is approximately 4.9*10<sup>5</sup>, which is ~5 orders of magnitude higher compared to that of ZnO nano-rods based devices. These observed effects have been attributed to the formation of Schottky junction at Ag/ZnO interface along with thinner nano-plates (~ 20 nm) present in honeycomb structures. The responsivity of the photoconductor is as high as 1.15 x 10<sup>3</sup>A/W, which can be ascribed to the thinner nano-walls and high Zn concentration in honeycomb nanostructures. Such large enhancement in the UV photo-response makes it a promising candidate for deep UV photo-detectors for commercial applications.
553	<strong>Excellent photoresponse of individual WS<sub>2</sub> nanowire-nanoflake hybrid materials</strong>	Van der Waals solids have been recognized as highly photosensitive materials that compete conventional Si and compound semiconductor based devices. While 2-dimensional (2D) nanosheets of single and multiple layers of molybdenum and tungsten chalcogenides have been extensively studied, their corresponding 1-dimensional and other nanostructured derivatives are not explored yet. Here, we report on the electrical and photosensitive properties of WS<sub>2</sub> nanowire-nanoflake hybrid materials we developed lately. We probe individual hybrid nanostructured particles along the structure using focused ion beam deposited Pt contacts. Further, we use conductive atomic force microscopy to analyze electrical behavior across the nanostructure in the transverse direction. The electrical measurements are complemented by in situ laser beam illumination to explore the photoresponse of the nanohybrids in the visible optical spectrum. Photodetector devices with responsivity up to ~0.4 AW<sup>-1</sup> are demonstrated outperforming other transition metal dichalcogenides and graphene.
554	Benchmarking of GGA density functionals for modeling structures of nanoporous, rigid and flexible MOFs	The adequate choice of interaction model is essential to reproduce qualitatively and estimate quantitatively the experimentally observed characteristics of materials or phenomena in computer simulations. Here we present the results of a benchmarking of DFT calculations of rigid and flexible metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The stability of these systems depends on the dispersion interactions. We compare the performance of two functionals, PBE and PBEsol, with and without the dispersion corrections (D2 and TS), in reproducing the high-accuracy low-temperature X-ray and neutron diffraction data for both groups of MOFs. We focus our analysis on the key structural parameters: the lattice parameters, bond lengths and angles. We show that the dispersion long range correction is essential to stabilize the structures and, in some cases, to converge the system to a geometry that is in line with the experimentally observed structure, especially for breathing MIL-53 structures or zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). We found that for all structures and all analyzed parameters the D2-corrected PBE functional performs the best, except for bonds involving the metal ions; however, even for these bonds, the difference between the experimentally observed and calculated lengths is small. Therefore, we recommend the use of PBE-D2 functional in further numerical analyses of rigid and flexible nanoporous MOFs.
555	<strong>Bolometric photodetection using plasmon-assisted resistivity change in vanadium dioxide</strong>	Vanadium oxide is a key sensing material for bolometric photodetection, thanks to its strong temperature dependence of resistivity close to room temperature. Here we demonstrate the photodetection of a stoichiometric vanadium dioxide thin film integrated with silver nanorods. The nanorods convert light into heat, consequently suppressing the resistivity of vanadium dioxide via localised surface plasmon resonance. Incorporation of this thermo-plasmonic effect into bolometric photodetection allows for wavelength and polarisation sensitivity. This work opens the path to a broad family of photodetection functionalities for vanadium dioxide-based microbolometers.
556	Cluster beams, nano-ripples and bio applications	Gas cluster ions are aggregates of weakly bonded gas atoms or molecules. Upon impact of gas cluster ions, multiple collisions occur between target atoms and the atoms in the cluster ions. These impact processes are completely different from those of collision-cascade process which are induced by atomic or molecular (monomer) ions. Although the impact process of gas cluster ions is different, ripples, which are similar to that formed by monomer ions, are formed by gas cluster ion impacts at oblique incidence. In this review, ripple formations by gas cluster ions are explained from the point of formation mechanism, characteristics, and applications of bio-sensors.

558	<strong>Spectroscopic behaviour of Er<sup>3+</sup>/Eu<sup>3+</sup>/Yb<sup>3+ </sup></strong><strong>codoped NaZnPO<sub>4 </sub>nanophosphors in optical thermometry</strong>	The Eu<sup>3+ </sup>activated Er<sup>3+</sup>/Yb<sup>3+</sup>: NaZnPO<sub>4 </sub>nanphosphors synthesized by co-precipitation technique have been structurally and optically characterized. The effect of Eu<sup>3+ </sup>ions concentration on photoluminescence (PL) intensity and mechanisms involved has been discussed. The red to green intensity ratio, suppression ratio and asymmetry ratio have been calculated with the variation of Eu<sup>3+</sup> concentration. The Eu&ndash;O ligand behaviour and spectral characteristics have been discussed in the light of nephelauxetic ratio and Judd&ndash;Ofelt parameters. Quantum yield of the nanophosphors is found to be ~ 25%. Optical thermometry behaviour of the developed nanophosphors with maximum sensitivity ~ 7.3&times;10<sup>-3 </sup>K<sup>-1</sup> at 503 K is reported.
559	Effects of RF Plasma Modification on the Thermal and Mechanical Properties of Electrospun Chitosan/Poly(vinyl Alcohol) Nanofiber Mats	On the design and fabrication of biomedical devices, the mechanical integrity and the thermal stability of the materials used are of paramount consideration. In this study, the effects of 13.56 MHz radio frequency plasma modification using argon (Ar) and oxygen (O2) plasma discharges on the morphology, thermal properties and tensile properties of the nonwoven electrospun chitosan/poly(vinyl alcohol) nanofibrous membranes were investigated. The SEM results have shown a significant change in the morphology of the nanofiber mats due to the Ar and O2 plasma discharges. The TG-DTG data revealed two major degradation steps for both the pristine samples and the Ar plasma-treated samples due to the molecular backbone degradation and decomposition of polyene and carbonyl residues. However, a third peak was observed for O2 plasma-treated samples which may be due to the oxygen functionalities imparted by the discharge. DSC results have shown the glass transition temperature at 65&#x00BA;C to 68&#x00BA;C and a melting temperature at around 200&#x00BA;C to 220&#x00BA;C. Also, a decrease in the crystallinity of the plasma-treated samples were noted from the DSC thermograms. A significant (p &lt; 0.0.5) decrease in the tensile strength, yield strength, Young's modulus and elongation at break were noted for the plasma-treated samples due to the etching and ablation effects induced by energetic particle interactions. However, the mechanical properties are still comparable with the tensile properties of human tissues such as the skin. These nonwoven mats with tuned properties have potential use in biomedical engineering particularly as tissue scaffolds, wound dressings, sutures and antibacterial gauzes.
560	<strong>Enhanced Electroluminescence Efficiency in Nanocluster Light Emitting Diodes through Apical Ligand Exchange</strong>	Metal halide nanoclusters represent an attractive class of molecular building blocks to design functional materials with superior optical properties that can be utilized in solar energy conversion, light emitting diodes, sensors and photodynamic therapies. Here, we demonstrate red and near-infrared light emitting diodes with a maximum external quantum efficiency &gt; 1% utilizing phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum iodide nanoclusters. This is the highest reported electrically driven quantum efficiency for nanoclusters. Efficiency improvement in these devices is realized by substituting heavier ligands in the apical nanocluster position that leads to the improvement in photoluminescence and exciton formation efficiencies in the nanoclusters. These results highlight how modulation of nanocluster salts with key terminal ligands has a profound effect on photoluminescence as well as electrical injection.
561	Propagation of THz Pulses in Rectangular Subwavelength Dielectric Waveguides	Rectangular subwavelength waveguides are necessary for the development of micro/nano photonic devices and on-chip platforms. Using a time-resolved imaging system, we studied the transient properties and the propagation modes of   THz pulses in rectangular subwavelength dielectric waveguides. The dynamic process of THz pulses was systematically recorded to a movie. In addition, an anomalous group velocity dispersion was demonstrated in rectangular subwavelength waveguides. By using effective index method, we theoretically calculated the modes in rectangular subwavelength waveguides, which agree well with the experiments and simulations. This work provides the opportunity to improve the analysis and design of the integrated platforms and photonic devices.
562	<strong>Novel Amorphous Nanowires from Solution Processed Ge<sub>25</sub>Se<sub>65</sub>Sb<sub>10</sub> Chalcogenide Glass</strong>	One dimensional chalcogenide nanostructures are promising candidates which enables new photonic functionalities. The findings of a novel one step method for synthesis of amorphous nanowires from GeSeSb chalcogenide glass using ethylenediamine or ethanolamine as solvent is reported. Inspite of having same morphology, it is manifested that the nanowire dimensions could be tuned with solute concentration which in turn helps for controllable nanowire characteristics.
563	Geometries and stabilities and electronic propertiessof (CdS)2n (n=5-27) electrode nanoclusters for supercapacitors	Metal sulfides hollow structures are advanced materials for energy storage applications of supercapacitors and sensors. Geometries and electronic properties of (CdS)2n (n=6-27) nanocages are calculated at the gradient corrected Perdew-Burke-Ernzerh (PBE) of exchange-correlation functional level with relativistic effect considered. The inner radius and charge-transfers along with surface stabilities and ionic semiconductor properties of hollowed (CdS)2n are increased as cage size being increased, the distinct metallic and semiconductor characters in largesize (CdS)2n are revealed. Particularly, the calculated energy gaps for (CdS)2n are generally decreased as size of (CdS)2n being increased, together with absorption spectra moving from short to long wavelength. The energy storage related quantum capacitance is discussed, interestingly, encapsulated nanocage (double-layer cage) has bigger capacitance and stronger capacity for energy storage than the mono-layer CdS nanocages. The particular stable geometry is assigned and comparison with available experimental and theoretical results is made.
564	Inhibition and formation of plasmonic resonances in flat metallic nanoantennas via periodic proximity	We numerically investigate control of plasmonic modes of strip-like flat metallic nanoantennas via their periodic arrangement in the form of two dimensional arrays (lattices). We demonstrate that via variation of the structural parameters of such lattices, we can adjust their plasmonic and photonic-plasmonic couplings, forming lattice-induced resonances that are characteristically different from the plasmonic modes that occur in individual nanoantennas. Our results show that when the incident light is polarized along the short axes of the nanoantennas, the arrays can dictate formation of bright surface modes far from the corners. By controlling the lattice constants the fields associated with such modes can penetrate deeply into the substrate, form field bridge across two locations of the same nanoanatenna or the neighboring ones, or couple to photonic fields. When the polarization of the incident light becomes polarized along the long axes of the nanoantennas, the presence of strong interplay between photonic-plasmonic hybridization and plasmonic coupling of neighboring nanoantennas can lead to formation of ultrasharp collective resonances. These results highlight how the close arrangement of flat metallic nanoatennas can modify charge distributions at the edges, inhibiting or imposing certain modes.
565	<strong>Acoustic Phonon Engineering in Bulk Crystals via Incorporation of Dopant Atoms</strong>	We report results of Brillouin &ndash; Mandelstam spectroscopy of transparent Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> crystals with <em>Nd</em> dopants. The ionic radius and atomic mass of <em>Nd</em> atoms are distinctively different from those of the host <em>Al </em>atoms. Our results show that even a small concentration of <em>Nd</em> atoms incorporated into the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> samples produces a profound change in the acoustic phonon spectrum. The velocity of the transverse acoustic phonons decreases by ~600 m/s at the <em>Nd</em> density of only ~0.1 %. Interestingly, the decrease in the phonon frequency and velocity with the doping concentration is non-monotonic. The obtained results, demonstrating that modification of the acoustic phonon spectrum can be achieved not only by nanostructuring but also by doping have important implications for thermal management as well as thermoelectric and optoelectronic devices.
566	Investigations on the plasma enabled growth of vertical graphene sheets on CNT surface	A theoretical model is developed to describe the plasma-assisted nucleation and growth kinetics of vertical graphene (VG) sheet on the carbon nanotube (CNT) surface. The present model accounts the formalization of charge separation region i.e., plasma sheath between the bulk plasma and substrate surface in one-dimension along with the kinetics of all the plasma species (neutrals, positively charged species, and electrons), rate of charge accumulation on the graphene sheet surface, and growth of VG sheet on the CNT surface owing to defects generation and various processes on the CNT surface. Using the model, we demonstrated that variations in the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process control parameters such as the total gas pressure, input power, and substrate bias can be used for significant variation in the plasma composition and characteristics that in turn control the ion bombardment and generation of carbon species on the CNT surface, and consequently tune the VG sheet growth characteristics such as, height, thickness and number density profiles of VG sheet on the CNT surface. The results of the present study indicate that as the total gas pressure is lowered and the input power and substrate bias are enhanced, the number densities and height of the VG sheet on the CNT surface are increased; however, the thickness of the VG sheet is reduced. Some of our theoretical findings are in good agreement with the existing experimental results.
567	<strong>Nanoscopic studies of domain structure evolution in ferroelectric La:HfO<sub>2</sub> capacitors</strong>	Visualization of domain structure evolution under an electrical bias has been carried out in ferroelectric La:HfO<sub>2</sub> capacitors by a combination of Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) and pulse switching techniques to study the nanoscopic mechanism of polarization reversal and the wake-up process. It has been directly shown that the main mechanism behind the transformation of the polarization hysteretic behavior and an increase in the remanent polarization value upon the alternating current (AC) cycling is electrically induced domain de-pinning. PFM imaging and local spectroscopy revealed asymmetric switching in the La:HfO<sub>2</sub> capacitors due to significant imprint likely caused by the different boundary conditions at the top and bottom interfaces. Domain switching kinetics can be well-described by the nucleation limited switching (NLS) model characterized by a broad distribution of the local switching times. It has been found that the domain velocity varies significantly throughout the switching process indicating strong interaction with structural defects.
568	Design and research on compact high-voltage pulse forming module with hundreds-nanosecond quasi-squared output pulse	A pulse forming module with multifunction of energy storage and pulse shaping is developed to meet the challenge of compact design and square output waveform in high-power Marx generator, as traditional compact Marx generator can only output double-exponential pulse profile. Expression of square waveform is obtained by Fourier series expansion and requirements on inductances and capacitors in a corresponding circuit are drawn. A simplified circuit model constructed by only 2 parallel branches, in which every branch contains an inductance and a capacitor in series has been proposed and investigated carefully to get quasi-square waveform. Pulse forming modules with compact size have been fabricated and tested under the guidance of the model theory. The capacitor is constructed with several folded flexible film capacitors in series for the purpose of getting high withstanding voltage and high energy density. The module is 6.4 L in volume with cuboid profile. It can be charged to 120 kV with stored energy density higher than 40 kJ/m<sup>3</sup>, and generates 180 ns-in-width quasi-square shaped pulse. It can also work repetitive at rep-rate of 50 Hz while the output waveforms show rarely difference. This research has further developed the practical application of pulse forming network to the lowest 2 branches, and it would be very helpful to reduce the size of the Marx-type high power generator system that based on it, while keep a quasi-square output waveform.
569	Growth and in-plane undulations of GaAs/Ge superlattices on [001]-oriented Ge and GaAs substartes: Formation of regular 3D island-in-network nanostructures	Coherently strained superlattice structures of 20-period GaAs/Ge have been epitaxially grown on [001]-oriented Ge and GaAs substrates by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). High-resolution X-ray diffraction and dynamic theory simulations revealed an increase in the growth rate of the Ge sublayers (<em>R</em><sub>Ge</sub>) and a decrease in that of the GaAs ones (<em>R</em><sub>GaAs</sub>) when GaAs is used, instead of Ge, as the substrate under otherwise the same growth conditions. They also revealed that the <em>R</em><sub>Ge</sub> is increased from 0.10 (0.11) to 0.22 (0.26) nm/s while the <em>R</em><sub>GaAs</sub> is decreased by ~9.8% (21.6%) on the Ge (GaAs) substrate when the growth temperature is increased from <em>T</em><sub>g</sub> = 560 to 580 &deg;C. Cross-sectional transmission-electron microscopy revealed regular in-plane undulations of the superlattices and their elemental distributions mapped by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy provided evidence that the Ge sublayers were conformally grown on GaAs while the GaAs sublayers were grown in regular in-plane isolated islands that initiated in the valleys of the Ge sublayers. The growth mechanism was discussed based on surface chemical potentials that depend on the balance between the surface-energy and the local strain-relaxation energy. Such three-dimensional periodic nanostructures, i.e., GaAs islands surrounded by Ge networks, can be useful when fabricating thermoelectric devices.
570	The kinetics and Thermodynamics of Nitriding of Nanocrystalline Iron	In this work, the kinetics and thermodynamics of nitriding of nanocrystalline iron were investigated. The nanocrystalline iron was fabricated using a novel surface severe plastic deformation technique called ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification. The grain boundary effects on nitriding were investigated by conducting gas nitriding of nanocrystalline iron and coarse-grained iron at different temperatures, from 300 to 560 &deg;C. The surface hardness, phase composition and the depth of nitriding layer were characterized. It is concluded that the grain boundary plays a more important role than residual strain/pre-stored dislocation for nitriding efficiency improvement. We further confirmed that, instead of promoting the nitrogen diffusion kinetics, the presence of grain boundary also affects the nitriding thermodynamics by decreasing the formation energy of nanoscale nitride particles. Due to the grain boundary effect, nanoscale nitride particles formed throughout the affected layer, making it possible for nitrogen to diffuse through the relatively high-diffusivity -Fe phase and to form a thicker affected layer. This work provides new understanding for low temperature nitriding of nanocrystalline metal.
571	<strong>Induced-Charge Electrokinetics in Rotating Electric Fields: a Linear Asymptotic Analysis</strong>	Concerning the electroconvective analyte manipulation in microfluidics, we describe the basic physics of fluid flow driven by rotating induced-charge electro-osmosis (ROT-ICEO), which occurs on the planar surface of a single floating electrode in an external rotating electric field. First, based on a linear asymptotic analysis, the dynamic flow stagnation line in ROT-ICEO induced on the bipolar electrode from a <em>rotary Debye screening charge</em> revolves synchronously with the applied rotating fields. A net hydrodynamic torque is then generated that acts on any fluid or particle sample to produce either a synchronous or asynchronous co-field rotation depending on the frequency of the ac signal. Next, from the synergy between the hydrodynamic and electrochemical ion relaxations, an analytical solution of the sample rotation rate subject to ROT-ICEO slipping on an ideally polarizable surface is obtained for different frequency ranges and determined by the transient nature of the rotating electro-osmotic flow oscillating at twice the field frequency. To visualize the flow field in ROT-ICEO, experiments were performed with fluorescent tracer nanoparticles; they exhibited concentric rotational behavior at the polarized phase interface. Formed like the arms of a nebula disk, the four twisted tails of nanoparticles can be arbitrarily directed under voltage-phase rectification. These experimental results are in good agreement with our mathematical simulations using the Debye&ndash;H&uuml;ckel approximation on ROT-ICEO.
572	<strong>Micro-Architecture Embedding Ultra-Thin Interlayer to Bond Diamond and Silicon via Direct Fusion</strong>	The continuous demand on miniaturized electronic circuits bearing high power density illuminates the need to modify silicon-on-insulator-based chip architecture. This is because of the low thermal conductivity of the few hundred nanometers-thick insulator present between the silicon substrate and active layers. The thick insulator is notorious for releasing the heat generated from the active layers during the operation of devices, leading to degrade their performance and reduce their lifetime. To avoid the heat accumulation, we propose a novel method to fabricate the silicon-on-diamond (SOD) micro-structure featured by an exceptionally thin silicon oxycarbide interlayer (~3 nm). While exploiting the diamond as an insulator, we employ spark plasma sintering to render the silicon directly fused to the diamond. Notably, this process can manufacture the SOD micro-architecture via simple/rapid manner, and incorporates the ultra-thin interlayer for minute thermal resistance. The method invented herein expects to minimize the thermal interfacial resistance of the devices and is thus deemed as a breakthrough appealing to the current chip industry.
573	<strong>Gate tunable surface plasmon resonance enhanced graphene/p-GaN heterostructure light-emitting diodes</strong>	By combing surface plasmon enhancement technique with gate effect, a high brightness blue lighting emitting diode (LED) based on graphene/p-GaN heterostructure has been achieved. The surface plasmon enhancement is introduced through coating Ag nanoparticles (NPs) on graphene/p-GaN heterostructure while the gate effect is demonstrated through a graphene/polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)/graphene sandwich structure, where the top graphene layer acts as the gate electrode. The electroluminescence (EL) emission intensity of Ag NPs/graphene/p-GaN heterostructure is largely enhanced when compared with the initial graphene/p-GaN heterostructure, which is attributed to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Ag NPs. The EL emission intensity of graphene/Ag NPs-PMMA/graphene/p-GaN heterostructure can be gate-tunable through exerting a static voltage between two graphene layers, which sufficiently tunes the Fermi level of graphene contacting with p-GaN. These results indicate that the development of graphene/p-GaN heterostructure LED could be advanced through sophisticated design and becomes a promising candidate for many important optoelectronic applications.
574	Multi-scale Structure Patterning by Digital-Mask Projective Lithography with an Alterable Projective Scaling System	We report a flexible and efficient method to pattern two-dimensional (2D) multi-scale structures by digital-mask projective lithography (DMPL) with an alterable projective scaling system. In the developed DMPL system, femtosecond laser was modulated by digital micromirror device (DMD) to generate a designable intensity distribution with digital image information. The projective law of this DMPL system based on the geometric optics theory verified for different projective scaling lens systematically has been studied. With the combination of the customizable DMD elements and alterable projective scaling system, 2D designable patterned microstructures with multi-scale size range from millimeter to hundred nanometer have been achieved by a single exposure. In addition, an engineered Fresnel zone plate (FZP) with numerical aperture (NA) of 0.36 and focal length of 114 &#xF06D;m has been achieved by a single exposure of 1.2 s. The acquisition of the array of FZP lens shows the stability and efficiency of the pattern process. The proposed method could be expected to play an important role in the flexible and efficient fabrication of engineered 2D multi-scale structures.
575	Modern aspects of Darcy-Forchheimer porous medium and convective condition in nanofluid through carbon nanotubes	This article deals with Darcy-Forchheimer three dimensional (3D) flow of water-based carbon nanotubes (CNTs). A bidirectional nonlinear stretchable surface has been employed to create the flow. Flow in porous space is represented by Darcy-Forchheimer expression. Heat transfer mechanism is explored through convective heating and heat generation/absorption. Results for single-wall (SWCNTs) and multi-wall (MWCNTs) carbon nanotubes have been presented and compared. The reduction of partial differential system into nonlinear ordinary differential system is made through suitable transformations. Optimal homotopy scheme is used for solutions development of governing flow problem. Optimal homotopic solution expressions for velocities and temperature are studied through plots by considering various values of physical variables. Moreover the surface drag coefficients and heat transfer rate are analyzed through plots.
576	<strong>Transport spectroscopy through dopant atom array in silicon junctionless nanowire transistors</strong>	We demonstrate transport spectroscopy through a dopant atom array in n-doped silicon junctionless nanowire transistors (JNTs) within temperature range from 6 K to 250 K. Several current steps are observed at the initial stage of the transfer curves below 75 K, which results from the electron transport from Hubbard bands to one dimensional conduction band. The current-off voltages in the transfer curves have strikingly positive shift below 20 K and negative shift above 20 K due to the electrostatic screening induced by ionized dopant atoms. There exists the minimum electron mobility at the critical temperature of 20 K, resulting from the interplay of thermal activation and impurity scattering. Furthermore, electron transport behaviors at the temperature of 30K have obvious transition from hopping conductance to thermal activation conductance.
577	Measurement of the third order optical nonlinearities of Graphene Quantum Dots in water at 355 nm, 532 nm and 1064 nm	The nonlinear responses of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) suspension in water are investigated at 355nm, 532 nm and 1064 nm using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser in the picosecond regime. The experiments are performed using a Z-scan based technique. The third-order nonlinear refractive index and the nonlinear absorption coefficients are determined. Under UV illumination where the NL response is found to be large, the nonlinear refractive index, the nonlinear absorption and the saturation intensity are estimated for a single graphene nanosheet constituting the GQDs through a simple model. The obtained values are in the order of magnitude of those obtained in bulk materials. We expect the present study to be useful for numerous future fundamental interest or potential applications.
578	Examining the effects of acoustic noise on scanning tunneling microscopy	Scanning tunneling microscopes are used to examine surfaces and surface properties with sub-nanometer precision. However, this high precision means these microscopes are extremely sensitive to vibration. A large body of work has examined vibration isolation systems that damp any vibration mechanically transmitted from the environment to the microscope through solid material. As most of these machines are housed in ultra-high-vacuum systems in order to protect the samples that they are being used to analyze and also to allow for analysis at ultra-low temperatures, mechanical vibration noise and electronic noise are the largest sources of error. Less work has examined the effect of acoustic vibrations transmitted from the environment to the microscope through the gaseous atmosphere. However, this examination is important for STMs housed in different environments, such as air or gloveboxes. In this paper, we demonstrate that even though the acoustical vibrations are enough to significantly degrade the image, the frequency peak of the acoustic vibration peak does not clearly appear in the FFT of the tunneling current during imaging. Thus, the best way to identify and isolate scanning tunneling microscopes from acoustic noise is while the tips are engaged but not scanning. Finally, we demonstrate atomic resolution for an STM housed in a glovebox taken while the pumps were running by acoustically isolating the microscope with a foam-lined acoustic shell.
579	Investigation of the relevant kinetic processes in the initial stage of a double-arcing instability in oxygen plasmas	A numerical investigation of the kinetic processes in the initial (nanosecond range) stage of the double-arcing instability was developed. The plasma-sheath boundary region of an oxygen-operated cutting torch was considered. The energy balance and chemistry processes in the discharge were described. It was shown that the double-arcing instability develops from a field-emission instability when the electric field at the nozzle wall reaches a critical value of &#x2248; 10^7 volts/m for the conditions considered. The field-emission instability drives in turn a fast electronic-to-translational energy relaxation mechanism, giving rise to a very fast gas heating rate of at least &#x2248; 10^9 K/s, mainly due to reactions of preliminary dissociation of oxygen molecules via the highly excited electronic state O2(B3&#x03A3;u-) populated by electron impact. It is expected that this fast oxygen heating rate further stimulates the discharge contraction through the thermal instability mechanism.
580	Nanoscale excitonic photovoltaic mechanism in ferroelectric BiFeO3 thin films	We report an electrode-free photovoltaic experiment in epitaxial thin film BiFeO3 where the picosecond optical absorption arising from carrier dynamics and piezoelectric lattice distortion due to the photovoltaic field are correlated at nanoscale. The data strongly suggest that the photovoltaic effect in phase pure BiFeO3 originates from diffusion of charge-neutral excitons and their subsequent dissociation localized at sample interfaces. This is in stark contrast to the belief that carrier separation is uniform within the sample due to the lack of center of symmetry in BiFeO3. This finding is important for formulating strategies in designing practical photovoltaic ferroelectric device.
581	Dotette: programmable, high-precision, plug-and-play droplet pipetting	Manual micropipette is the most heavily used liquid handling device in biological and chemical laboratories, however, it suffers from low precision for volume under 1&#x00B5;L as well as inevitable human errors. For a manual device, the human errors introduced pose potential risks of failed experiments, inaccurate results, and financial costs. Meanwhile, low precision under 1&#x00B5;L can cause severe quantification errors and high heterogeneity of outcomes, becoming a bottleneck of reaction miniaturization for quantitative research in biochemical labs. Here we report Dotette, a programmable, plug-and-play microfluidic pipetting device based on nanoliter liquid printing. With automated control, protocols designed on computers can be directly downloaded into Dotette, enabling programmable operation processes. Utilizing continuous nanoliter droplet dispensing, the precision of the volume control has been successfully improved from traditional 20%-50% to less than 5% in the range of 100nL to 1000nL. Such a highly automated, plug-and-play add-on to existing pipetting device not only improves precise quantification in low-volume liquid handling and reduce chemical consumptions, but also facilitates and automates a variety of biochemical and biological operations.
582	Emergence of Strain Induced Two Dimensional Metallic State in ReS<sub>2</sub>	We present a highly versatile system ReS<sub>2</sub> , which transforms from a semiconductor to a two dimensional metal under uni-axial compressive strain along &rsquo;a&rsquo; direction in both bulk and monolayer. The 2D nature is realised from highly flat Fermi surfaces and anisotropic transport properties. Moreover the layer independent electronic structure properties are revisited and thermoelectric properties of ReS<sub>2</sub> in bulk, monolayer and bilayer forms reveal the competing thermoelectric (TE) coefficients in each form. The in-plane power-factor shows an enhancement over &rsquo;c&rsquo;-axis value as a function of strain, which is almost two orders of magnitude. In addition, strain induced tunable in-plane anisotropy of almost one order has been observed in both bulk and monolayer ReS<sub>2</sub> (around 20%), which further open up the possibility of TE application as nanowires. Our analysis unveils a<br />wide range of application for ReS 2 in the field of thermoelectrics as bulk and thin films for a large temperature range. The magnitude of TE coefficients are comparable with other well established transition metal dichalocogenides.
583	Influence of H2 flow in photoluminescence intensities of SiOx films deposited by HFCVD	In the present work, we report the influence of the hydrogen flow in the photoluminescence (PL) intensities and structural properties of the SiOx. The method used for the deposit of the SiOx films was the Hot Filament Chemical Vapor Deposition (HFCVD) technique using quartz bars as precursors sources; the SiOx films are obtained at different hydrogen flow at 25, 50, 75 and 100 sccm; also, the films were annealed at 1000 &ordm;C in nitrogen atmosphere. The characterization techniques used for this study were High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Transmittance, PL and profilometer. HRTEM reveals the presence of high density of Si-nanocrystals with sizes of 1 nm and the formation of Si-nanoislands with different crystal orientation and similar to the substrate. SiOx films exhibit a large broadband PL spectra with main peaks at 650 to 850 nm and the decrement of the intensity of the PL depends of the increment of H2 flows; however, the PL disappear after the annealing in all cases. On the contrary, the profilometer shows an increment of thickness with the increment of the H2 flows. However, FTIR confirms that the deposits are SiOx with the characteristic vibration modes and shows H2 desorption after annealing. The transmittance reveals an increment on the band gap from 2.36 to 3 eV and is related with the PL results using the QC by the Si-nc. The method to obtain Si-ncs and Si-nis is compatible with silicon technology and is clearly very simple and novelty.
584	Deterministic role of frequency, amplitude and concentration regimes on the complex dielectric response of nanocolloids	The present article explores the governing roles played by concentration regimes, frequency and amplitude of the forcing electric field on the dynamic dielectric responses of  nanocolloidal  non-polar suspensions. Frequency dependent complex dielectric constants  were determined  in the band of 1 to 107 Hz at constant temperature  via dielectric spectroscopy. In addition to prevalant literature measurements, influence of field amplitude has also been performed to investigate the role of electric field intensity upon the relaxation behaviors.  The experimental observations reveal that variation of frequency, as well as choice of particle material significantly influences the dielectric responses of nanocolloids. Further, the amplitude of field is found to induce differences in the dielectric response. It is also observed that the relaxation responses are grossly different for concentrated dispersions than the dilute counterparts. The concentration regimes are observed to bring about overlapping relaxation responses  in the colloids.  Good degree of quantitative agreement has been found between the experimental observations and the generic Havriliak-Negami relaxation model.  It has been shown that for a given nanomaterial, reduction of relaxation time scale  is a direct consequence of enhancement  in concentration and the colloids transit from predominantly storage to leaky systems with concentration regimes. .  Additionally, the reported volume diffusion mechanism (VDM)  is found to be in compliance with the experimental findings. The occurrence and shift of peaks and valleys in the dielectric spectra has been explained based on dielectric response theories for electrically heterogeneous media.
585	<strong><strong>Comment on &ldquo;Submicron cubic boron nitride as hard as diamond&rdquo; by Guoduan Liu <em>et al</em>.</strong></strong>	The new phase diagram of nanocrystalline BN can explain well the observed domain structure within nanocrystalline grains. The only source of cubic domain structure is the phase transition from hexagonal to cubic phase during cooling of the sample. This required the lowering of transition line with respect to its position in the phase diagram of bulk crystal. This result is a significant and important improvement of results obtained in the commented paper.
586	Enhanced photon-phonon coupling via dimerization in one-dimensional optomechanical crystals	We show that dimerization of an optomechanical crystal lattice, which leads to folding of the band diagram, can couple flexural mechanical modes to optical fields within the unit cell via radiation pressure. When compared to currently realized crystals, a substantial improvement in the coupling between photons and phonons is found. For experimental verification, we implement a dimerized lattice in a silicon optomechanical nanobeam cavity and measure a vacuum coupling rate of g<sub>0</sub>/2&pi;=1.7 MHz between an optical resonance at &lambda;c = 1545 nm and a mechanical resonance at 1.14 GHz.
587	<strong>The Uniformity Study of Non-oxide Thin Film </strong><strong>at Device Level Using Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy</strong>	Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) has been widely used as a chemical analysis technique to characterize materials chemical properties, such as element valence states, atoms/ions bonding environment. This study provides a new method to characterize physical properties (i.e., film uniformity, grain orientations) of non-oxide thin films in the magnetic device by using EELS microanalysis on scanning transmission electron microscope. This method is based on analyzing white line ratio of spectra and related extended energy loss fine structures so as to correlate it with thin film uniformity. This new approach can provide an effective and sensitive method to monitor/characterize thin film quality (i.e., uniformity) at atomic level for thin film development, which is especially useful for examining ultra-thin films (i.e., several nanometers) or embedded films in devices for  industry applications. More importantly, this technique enables development of quantitative characterization of thin film uniformity and it would become to be a remarkably useful technique for examining various types of devices for industrial applications.
588	From size-dependent strengthening to softening in nanolaminated Cu/Cu-Zr crystalline/amorphous micropillars	Strength and deformation behaviors of nanolaminated Cu/Cu-Zr crystalline/amorphous micropillars within wide ranges of intrinsic modulation ratio &#x03B7; (0.1-3.0) and extrinsic diameter D (300-1500 nm) were investigated by using microcompression tests. Experimental results revealed a transition of D-dependent deformation mode from homogeneous-like to shear localization at large &#x03B7;, while D-independent homogeneous extrusion of Cu at small &#x03B7;. Furthermore, the flow strength increased with raising D at small &#x03B7;, but decreased at large &#x03B7;, exhibiting a D-insensitive strength at a critical &#x03B7;*~0.5. These unusual results were rationalized in terms of a coupling effect of dislocation actions and shear transformation zone mediated operations.
589	Laser Shock Compression Induced Crystallization of Ce<sub>3</sub>Al Metallic Glass	Laser shock compression studies on Ce<sub>3</sub>Al metallic glass performed using a 3 J Nd:YAG laser indicate shock induced crystallization, evidenced by presence of a two-wave particle velocity profile and observed structural XRD analysis of recovered material. A direct shock compression setup was designed with 25 &micro;m thick Ni driver foil, 40 &micro;m thick Ce<sub>3</sub>Al metallic glass ribbon, and 3 mm thick PMMA backer window for use with input laser energies varying from 100 to 2000 mJ. Below 300 mJ laser input energy, samples were recovered showing no visual or structural changes evidenced via XRD analysis. Velocimetry measurements indicated onset of a two wave structure with the primary wave followed by a smaller secondary wave. At input laser energies of 400 mJ and above, samples are recovered showing visible deformation and crystallization, evidenced by Rietveld analysis of diffraction patterns obtained from recovered samples. The corresponding velocity profiles also showed a distinct two wave structure, with the secondary wave increasing in magnitude with energy and the primary wave maintaining a constant velocity. The overall results reveal possible densification of the glass due to delocalization of 4f electrons in Ce at lower laser shock energies, and increased crystallization with preferred orientation and distortion of the nanocrystals at higher energies.
590	<strong>Enhanced Thermoelectric Efficiency in Topological Insulator Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> Nanoplates via Atomic Layer Deposition-based Surface Passivation</strong>	We report in-plane thermoelectric measurements of Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3 </sub>nanoplates, a typical topological insulator (TI) with Dirac-like metallic surface states, grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The as-grown flakes exposed to ambient conditions exhibit relatively small thermopowers around -34&micro;V/K due to unintentional surface doping (e.g., gas adsorption and surface oxidation). After removal of the unintentional surface doping and surface passivation by deposition of 30nm of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> using atomic layer deposition (ALD), the Seebeck coefficient of these flakes increases by a factor of 5X to -169&micro;V/K. Here, we believe that the ALD-based surface passivation can prevent the degradation of the thermoelectric properties caused by gas adsorption and surface oxidation processes, thus, reducing the unintentional doping in the Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> and increasing the Seebeck coefficient. The high surface-to-volume ratio of these thin (~10nm thick) nanoplates make them especially sensitive to surface doping, which is a common problem among nanomaterials in general. An increase in the sample resistance is also observed after the ALD process, which is consistent with the decrease in doping.
591	<strong>Binary Cu-Zr Thin Film Metallic Glasses with Tunable Nanoscale Structures and Properties</strong>	Motivated by the concept of nanoglass where the nanoscale glassy grains and interfaces can bring unique properties into glassy materials, we develop a series of binary Cu-Zr thin film metallic glasses (TFMGs) with tunable nanoscale structures by using direct-current (DC) magnetron sputtering technique. Depending on the chemical composition and the sputtering parameters, Cu-Zr TFMGs show variable nanoscale structures from nanocolumn to nanogranula. As compared to the metallic glassy ribbons with identical composition, the Cu-Zr TFMGs with nanoscale structures exhibit novel and unique thermal and mechanical properties. From nanoindentation study, it is found that the TFMGs with nanoscale structures display obvious reduced hardness (about 48-52%) and increased elastic modulus (about 7-23.8%) as compared to the metallic glassy ribbons. Moreover, the serrated flow behavior, as commonly observed from the load-displacement response in the nanoindentation of metallic glasses (MGs) is absence for nanostructured TFMGs, indicating the profound effects of nanoscale structural features on the plastic yielding and flow in TFMGs. This study provides a detail insight into a strategy of designing nanostructured TFMGs and obtaining tunable properties which is of great interest in the potential application of micro/nanoscale devices.
592	Electron-vibrational theory of long-range Frenkel exciton polaritons in nanofibers of organic dye	We develop a mean-field electron-vibrational theory of Frenkel exciton polaritons in organic dye structures. The theory contains experimentally measured quantities that make it closely related to experiment, and provides a possibility of generalization to a nonlinear regime. Between other things, we explain the additional red shift of the H-aggregate absorption spectra (that are blue-shifted as a whole). We apply the theory to experiment on fraction of a millimeter propagation of Frenkel exciton polaritons in photoexcited organic nanofibers made of thiacyanine dye. A good agreement between theory and experiment is obtained.
593	<strong>Femtosecond laser-induced transformations in ultra-low expansion glass:  microstructure and local density variations by vibrational spectroscopy</strong>	We report X-ray diffraction, resonance Raman and infrared (IR) results on pristine ultra-low expansion (ULE) glass, a binary titanosilicate glass with 5.67 mol% TiO<sub>2</sub>.  ULE processing by femtosecond (fs) laser radiation leads to nanogratings writing and photo-darkening for imaging and data storage. The knowledge gained here on pristine ULE is employed to understand the transformation mechanisms in this glass by fs laser irradiation at 515 nm. Optical imaging revealed the formation of micro-cavities, and Raman mapping showed molecular oxygen trapped in such cavities of laser-irradiated ULE glass. While titanium in the pristine glass was found predominantly in tetrahedral Ti<sup>4+ </sup>sites highly dispersed in the silicate matrix, Raman and IR reflectance spectroscopy on laser-irradiated ULE indicated the formation of Ti<sup>3+</sup> sites; Ti<sup>3+ </sup>octahedral sites are formed in the shells of cavities and aggregate in amorphous Ti<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-type<sub> </sub>clusters, while the glass around and below cavities contains Ti<sup>3+</sup> tetrahedral sites dispersed in the silicate network. Laser-processed ULE glass was found to exhibit also local restructuring of the silicate matrix. Shifts of the strong IR band at about 1080-1100 cm<sup>-1</sup> were translated into changes of the average Si-O-Si bond angle in the laser-transformed areas, and found to reflect local density variations; the average local density increases relative to silica glass up to about 8% in the shells of micro-cavities and decreases by about 0.5% in the surrounding material. Chemical processes were proposed to account for photo-darkening and local structural transformation effect in the probed areas of the fs laser-processed ULE glasses.
594	<strong>Reduced Thermal Conductivity of Si/Ge Random Layer Nanowires: A Comparative Study against Superlattice Counterparts </strong>	Si/Ge nanowires are considered as promising candidates as efficient thermoelectric materials due to their remarkable thermal insulating performance over bulk counterparts. In this study, thermal insulating performance of Si/Ge nanowires of randomly organized layer thickness, called random layer nanowires (RLNWs), is systematically investigated and compared against superlattice nanowires (SLNWs). The thermal conductivity (TC) of these structures are evaluated via non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and more informative insight is gained by normal mode decomposition and lattice dynamics calculations. It is demonstrated that the modes in random layer structures, in general, exhibit similar characteristics except the degree of localization to the corresponding superlattice counterparts by comparing the mode spectral energy densities, relaxation times, density of states and participation ratios.  For all physical and geometrical conditions investigated here, RLNWs show improved thermal insulating performance over corresponding SLNWs. More importantly, a RLNW of low mean layer thickness attains even lower TC than the corresponding Si/Ge alloy nanowire indicating the effectiveness of the random layer arrangements. An anomalous trend in TC of RLNWs (larger than the bulk counterpart) is observed at higher cross-sectional widths and it is explained as a competing effect of phonon localization and wall scattering.  Moreover, it is illustrated that the effectiveness of thermal insulating performance of RLNW depends on the fraction of coherent phonons that exist and how effectively those phonons are subject to localization under different cases.
595	Effects of nanoscale texturing of PMMA surface by atmospheric pressure plasma jet array on surface wettability	Recently developed atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) is considered as a novel and efficient technique for uneven surfaces processing and APPJ array effectively expands the treatment area of a single APPJ. In this paper, a two-dimensional (2D) APPJ array in Ar/tetramethylsilane (TMS) is used to improve the surface hydrophobicity of polymethyl methcraylate (PMMA) by depositing silica nanotexture on the PMMA surface. The electrical and optical characteristics of the 2D Ar/TMS APPJ array are measured to optimize experimental conditions. The wettability of PMMA surface is assessed by water contact angle measurement, which increases from 65{degree sign} to a maximum value of 115{degree sign} after 240 s plasma treatment at 0.04% TMS content. Scanning electron microscopy is used to investigate the micro- and nanoscales surface morphologies of PMMA after plasma treatment and it is found there are discrete coral structure clusters with hundreds of nanometers particles attached on the PMMA surface. The nanotextured structure enhances the surface hydrophobicity by the suspension of the water drop. The changes of the chemical composition and chemical bonding on the PMMA surface are further analyzed using Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. It is found that the silicon-containing groups such as Si-O-Si, Si-CH3, and Si-H replace oxygen-containing hydrophilic polar groups (C-O and C=O), reduce the surface polarity, decrease the surface tension, and increase the surface hydrophobicity. The results demonstrate that the APPJ array can be a novel tool for the preparation of nanotextured polymeric surfaces in ambient air and has the potentials for the formation of superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic surfaces.
596	<strong>Improving performance of </strong><strong><strong>Si/CdS </strong></strong><strong><strong>micro-/nanoribbon</strong></strong><strong><strong> p-n heterojunction light emitting diodes</strong></strong><strong><strong> by trenched structure</strong></strong>	Realizing high performance silicon based light sources has been an unremitting pursuit of researchers. In this letter, we propose a simple structure to enhance electroluminescence emission and reduce the threshold of injected current of silicon/CdS micro-/nanoribbon p-n heterojunction visible light emitting diodes, by fabricating trenched structure on silicon substrate to mount CdS micro-/nanoribbon. A series of experiments and simulation analysis favors the rationality and validity of our mounting design. After mounting the CdS micro-/nanoribbon, the optical field confinement increases, and absorption and losses from high refractive silicon substrate is effectively reduced. Meanwhile the sharp change of silicon substrate near heterojunction also facilitates the balance between electron current and hole current, which substantially conduces to the stable amplification of electroluminescence emission in CdS micro-/nanoribbon.
597	Upconversion luminescence of Er<sup>3+</sup> ions in new transparent glass-ceramics with BaF<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals in ZnF<sub>2</sub>-BaO-B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> system and formation of BaF<sub>2</sub>-like migration in the glass	BaF2 nanocrystals were formed by heat-treatment of the Er<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-doped 30ZnF<sub>2</sub>-30BaO-40B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> glasses, and the crystal size decreased with increasing Er<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> content: particle sizes of 32 and 8 nm were obtained for the non-doped sample and the 1 mol% Er<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-doped sample. The Er<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-doped glass-ceramics showed high optical transparency. Upon continuous-wave laser excitation at 980 nm, both of the glass and glass-ceramic samples showed upconversion luminescence even though borate has high phonon energy, and the shape of the spectrum of the glass resembles that of BaF<sub>2</sub> crystals, indicating the formation of a BaF<sub>2</sub>-like structure in the as-quenched glass.
598	Spectral quasi-linearization method for power-law nanofluid with temperature dependent variable thermal conductivity	A mathematical model is developed to study  MHD free convection in power-law nanofluid flow over an inclined plate in a porous medium in the presence of variable thermal conductivity, Ohmic dissipation, suction/injection and chemical reaction. In this study we consider both  (prescribed surface temperature) PST and (prescribed heat flux) PHF cases. The nonlinear consevation equations of momentum, energy and species mass diffusion were solved using the spectral quasi linearization method (SQLM) over the entire range of physical parameters with appropriate boundary conditions. The SQLM method finds recursive formulae for higher order non-linear equations which are then evaluated using the Chebyshev spectral collocation method. The influence of Brownian motion and thermophoresis parameters on velocity, temperature and concentration fields are studied for both the PST and PHF cases. The numerical data are compared with published work and found to be in excellent agreement.  The velocity, temperature and concentration profiles are increased due to increase the effect of modified thermophoresis parameter in PST and PHF cases and the reverse was seen for the concentration profiles due to increase in the Brownian motion parameter.
599	Dipolar effects on the magnetic phases of superparamagnetic clusters	We report a theoretical study of the impact of dipolar interactions on the room temperature magnetic phases of superparamagnetic nanoparticles confined in spherical and ellipsoidal clusters. We consider Fe3O4 nanoparticles with size ranging from 9 nm to 12 nm, arranged with uniform density in hundred <br />nanometer-sized clusters. We show that one may have large enhancement of the initial susceptibility for ellipsoidal clusters of high eccentricity, as required for most biomedical applications. Spherical clusters display a reduction of the initial susceptibility, due to the early nucleation of new magnetic phases. In densely packed systems the dipolar interaction may lead to thermal stabilization of the individual nanoparticles moments, while keeping the cluster <br />superparamagnetic, with a vanishingly small magnetic moment in the absence of external field. The theoretical model is used to discuss recent findings on quasi-one-dimensional arrays of superparamagnetic Fe and Co nanoparticles, and on spherical clusters of superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles.
600	Optical stack study by a photon - phonon interaction approach	Two complementary techniques, picosecond ultrasonics (PU) and Brillouin light scattering (BLS), have been performed to measure the mechanical properties of layers involved in an optical stack. One of the advantages of these two techniques is their ability to analyze samples whose thickness varies from a few tens of nanometers (the anti-reflective coating) to several millimeters (the polymer substrate). Since all the layers constituting the optical stack have proved to be isotropic, they are completely elastically characterized thanks to the two techniques. Moreover, as the two independent elastic coefficients are measured by PU and BLS, c<sub>33</sub> and c<sub>44</sub> respectively, the complete stiffness matrix and, hence, the Poisson&rsquo;s ratio and the Young&rsquo;s modulus can be deduced.
601	Abnormal blueshift of the absorption edge in graphene nanodots	In a conventional semiconductor when the dielectric screening effect is suppressed, the exciton binding energy increases and the corresponding excitonic transition would exhibit a redshift in the spectrum. In this work, we study the optical properties of hexagonal graphene nanodots by using a configuration interaction approach and reveal that the edge of the absorption spectrum shows an abnormal blueshift as the environmental dielectric constant &#x03B5;<sub>r</sub> decreases. The two dominant many-body effects in the nanodot, the quasiparticle and excitonic effects are both found to scale almost linearly with &#x03B5;<sub>r</sub><sup>-1</sup>. The former is shown to have a larger proportionality constant and thus accounts for the blueshift of the absorption edge. In opposite to the long-range Coulomb interaction, the on-site Coulomb energy is is found to have a negative impact on the bright excitonic states. With a strong dielectric screening effect in presence, a strong short-range Coulomb interaction is revealed to be responsible for the disintegration of the bright exciton.
602	Macroscopic superhydrophobicity achieved by atomic decoration with silicones	Modulating wetting states of water droplets on a solid surface has a great potential in numerous applications such as self cleaning, heat transfer and water purification. Present strategies to achieve controlled wettability usually employ surface roughness and/or chemical coating at the nanometer-to-micrometer scale. Here we propose that atomic-scale decoration and patterning with silicones can be used to fabricate superhydrophobic surfaces. Atomic decoration, differing from chemical coatings in characteristic size and partial coverage, controls wetting states with the atomic precision (several angstroms) at low cost and maintains a long lifetime. We attribute the mechanism of atomic decoration to the decrease in effective potential-well depth, inducing weak interactions between the substrate and water droplet. Our work pushes water wetting to the limit of atomic scales, hinting for a paradigm shift from macroscopic to atomically-precise engineering of wetting states and providing new insights for fabricating superhydrophobic surfaces.
603	<strong>Efficiency-enhanced AlGaInP light-emitting diodes using transparent plasmonic silver nanowires</strong>	Silver nanowire (AgNW) networks have been demonstrated to exhibit superior transparent and conductive performance over that of indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) and have been proposed to replace ITO, which is currently widely used in optoelectronic devices despite the scarcity of indium on Earth. In this paper, the current spreading and enhanced transmittance induced by AgNWs were analysed, which are two important factors influencing light output power. The enhanced transmittance was studied by finite-difference time-domain simulation and verified by cathodoluminescence measurements. The enhancement ratio of light output power decreased with increasing GaP layer thickness, with values of 79 %, 52 % and 15 % for GaP layer thicknesses of 0.5, 1 and 8 &micro;m, respectively, when an AgNW network was included in AlGaInP light-emitting diodes. This was because of the decreased current distribution tunability of the AgNW network with increasing GaP layer thickness. The large enhancement of light output power was caused by the AgNWs increasing carrier spread out of the electrode and the enhanced transmittance induced by the plasmonic AgNWs. Further decreasing the sheet resistance of AgNW networks could raise their light output power enhancement ratio.
604	<strong>Nanoscale structural parameters based analytical model for GaN HEMTs</strong>	A physics-based analytical model for III-V based high electron mobility transistor is proposed considering the influence of interface trap density on the channel charge. The variations in permittivity caused due to the change in thickness of the semiconductor layers from their bulk counterpart to the nanoscale are integrated into the model for the first time. In addition, the contribution of two lowest energy levels is considered widening the applicability of the model for various device designs. The consistency of the proposed model is demonstrated by comparing modelled results with the experimental results of different device designs and dimensions fabricated from different materials, including GaN.
605	Optical Spectroscopy in pure and Sr doped NiO Nanostructures: A comprenhsive study	Ni<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>O (x= 0.0, 0.02, 0.04) nanoparticles calcined at 700 <sup>0</sup>C with crystallite size ranging from 17.92 -22.39 nm have been synthesized using liquid-solid phase route such as sol-gel method. Structural properties have shown that nanoparticles are spherical shaped. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was carried out to explore their optical band-gap with associated weak absorption tail (E<sub>WAT</sub>) and Urbach (E<sub>U</sub>) energies that confirm the increased disorder with Sr incorporation into NiO samples. Our samples exhibit low reflectance about 15% and high transmittance 41.48 % in the visible region of the spectrum which more confirm the high transparency in the visible region. The refractive index <em>n (&lambda;)</em> and extinction coefficient k (&lambda;) spectra show normal and anamolous dispersion  in the range 200-800 nm. In addition, optical dielectric constants, optical conductivity ( ), high frequency dielectric constant using dispersion through  both of free carriers and bound carriers, static refractive index (<em>n<sub>o</sub></em>), WDD static refractive index ( ), ratio of free carrier concentration, effective mass (  and plasma frequency ( ) have also been determined. The refractive index dispersive behaviour is also examined through Wenple-DiDomenico (WDD) single oscillator model and optical dispersion parameters <em>E<sub>o</sub></em> and <em>E<sub>d</sub></em> were calculated using WDD model. The PL spectra of all the samples deconvoluted using Gaussian function and found that  extra  green and yellow bands are originate in PL emission spectrum for undoped NiO sample and further these bands supressed in Sr doped NiO samples which confirm the reduced defects in the NiO  on the Sr doping.s<p><strong> </strong>
606	<strong>Improvement of durability and switching speed by incorporating nanocrystals in the HfO<sub>x</sub> based resistive random access memory devices</strong>	Resistive random access memory (RRAM) has attracted significant interest for next-generation nonvolatile memory applications. However, it is somehow difficult to design a high speed RRAM device with enhanced data reliability. This paper deals with the improvement of high speed durable switching in nanocrystals based RRAM (NC-RRAM) devices. The high performance RRAM devices were prepared by incorporating the NCs into the HfO<sub>x</sub> oxide layer. As compared to the without (w/o) NC devices, the NC-RRAM devices are capable to execute uniform switching with higher set speed of 100 ns and reset speed of 150 ns, longer retention time and higher endurance of 10<sup>8</sup> cycles at 85<sup>o</sup>C. The electrical conduction at low resistance state is mostly dominated by Ohmic mechanism, whereas at high resistance state the space-charge-limited current is the best match. The possible switching mechanism is due to the formation and rupture of the conductive filaments (CFs) inside the oxide film. The enhanced electric field intensity on the surface of the NCs can effectively facilitate the formation and rupture of the CFs, hence the improvement in the overall electrical performance of the NC-RRAM devices as compare to the w/o RRAM.
607	Transitions of complex spin spiral magnetic structure in FeGe2 nanowires prepared by chemical vapor deposition	Iron germanium nanowires and films were prepared via a high pressure catalyst free chemical vapor deposition on Ge(111) wafer. Both nanowires and films were identified to be single crystal FeGe2. However, nanowires exhibited a saturation in field dependent magnetization while that of film did not. Magnetic field dependent resisitivity showed two drops in warming curve from 10-300K with a magnetic field of 6T and 9T. These abnoraml drops might attribute to a less scattering of electrons from complex spiral structures. The longtitudinal spiral and transverse spiral magnetic structure could help induce the abormal behaviors.
608	Thermoelectric mechanism of low-field electron emission from nanocarbon films	In previous experiments, sp2-carbon island films (or disordered quantum-dot arrays) were found to be capable of low-field electron emission - starting from ca. 1 V/&#x03BC;m. Comprehensive study of film samples showed absence of high-aspect topography features (nanotubes, fibers, etc.) or areas with substantially lowered workfunction, which complicates explanation of this phenomenon. For these films, we propose a novel mechanism of emission facilitation by thermoelectric field induced by concentrated heat release in nanometer-sized islands serving as emission centers (ECs). The thermoelectric effect in the considered case may be additionally enhanced by ballistic character of phonon flow from ECs into substrate. Quantitative estimates performed for typical experimental conditions and film morphology predicted local thermoelectric field magnitudes as high as ~108 V/m, sufficient for field emission from all forms of carbon. Theoretical consideration of the relationship between thermal and electric parameters (namely, released heat power and EC potential) showed possible existence of a nontrivial solution describing self-maintained equilibrium state. In this state, the emitting carbon island is protected from both overheating and electric breakdown. Low values of threshold field and effective workfunction (derived from emission current characteristics) find natural explanation in the suggested model. The model can be also relevant to other nanostructured emitting materials and films.
609	Crystallization of submicron amorphous hydrogenated silicon films with different hydrogen concentration by nanosecond ruby laser irradiation	The processes of a pulsed ruby laser induced crystallization of submicron (0.7 um) amorphous hydrogenated silicon films with different hydrogen concentration of 2, 12 and 39 atomic % were investigated. The films were prepared on glass substrates by Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition technique followed by isothermal annealing in nitrogen atmosphere. The laser annealing (&#x03BB; = 694 nm) was carried out at pulse duration of 80 ns (FWHM) in the fluence range from 0.6 to 2.1 J/cm2. The laser fluence thresholds for surface area crystallization were found for different hydrogen concentration in the films. It was supposed, that the increasing of hydrogen concentration leads to increasing of the threshold energy density (laser fluence) for surface area crystallization due to decreasing of light absorption in the films with higher hydrogen concentration.
610	<strong>Size modulated Griffiths phase and spin dynamics in double perovskite Sm<sub>1.5</sub>Ca<sub>0.5</sub>CoMnO<sub>6</sub> </strong>	Griffiths phase like behavior has been investigated in details in size modulated Sm<sub>1.5</sub>Ca<sub>0.5</sub>CoMnO<sub>6</sub> double perovskite, having ferromagnetic entities in the paramagnetic matrix. Temperature dependent real and imaginary part of ac susceptibility confirms that Sm<sub>1.5</sub>Ca<sub>0.5</sub>CoMnO<sub>6</sub>-1150 &deg;C bulk-sample has spin-glass like ordering below T<sub>g </sub>~ 34.88(3) K. This glassy behavior is attributed to the antisite disorders (~7.12%) along with structural and magnetic frustration in the system. However, the ground state of Sm<sub>1.5</sub>Ca<sub>0.5</sub>CoMnO<sub>6</sub>-600 &deg;C nanometric-sample is observed to be antiferromagnetic in nature due to the presence of large antisite disorders (~ 53.58%). The observed unusual co-existence of antiferromagnetism with Griffiths-like phase in Sm<sub>1.5</sub>Ca<sub>0.5</sub>CoMnO<sub>6</sub>-600 &deg;C sample is rare in nature. Interesting magnetic spin dynamics and aging effect are also observed in both the compounds suggesting different spin relaxation processes in low temperature regime. The observed magnetism in these compounds can be tuned by nearest neighbor Co-O-Mn and/or Co-O-Co/Mn-O-Mn exchange interactions as well as the next nearest neighbor Co-O-O-Co/Mn-O-O-Mn interaction.
611	<strong>Giant sensitivity to strain in cracked thin films based on metallic nanoparticles in a dielectric matrix<sup></sup></strong>	<SPAN style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 150%;">Platinum nanoparticle-based strain gauges are elaborated by means of atomic layer deposition on flexible polyimide substrates. Their electro-mechanical response is tested under mechanical bending at strain levels up to 1%. Sudden changes in electrical resistance are observed above 0.6% strain when straight cracks are formed in the nanostructured thin film. Scanning Electron Microscope experiments reveal that these cracks are preferentially formed next to the interface with aluminum top electrodes. After cracks formation, a giant gauge factor of 2.10<sup>4</sup> is measured at a strain level of 0.3%. This high sensitivity to strain is attributed to the gradual opening (or closing) of the cracks when mechanical strain is applied. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of a flexible heart rate monitor which integrates a cracked Pt nanoparticle-based strain gauge.</SPAN>
612	Towards a deeper understanding of nanoscratch-induced deformation in a phosphate glass	In this work, the factors affecting the nanoscratch-induced deformation of oxide glass in the completely ductile range are classified into three independent aspects, including plastic damage, densification and chemistry-enhanced material-removal. Through comparing the deformation volume of a phosphate glass subject to different conditions, viz. in dry or humid air and before or after annealing, the contributions of the three factors to the total deformation were quantified and their evolution mechanisms were clarified for sustained scratching. Analyses indicate that the combined action of plastic damage and densification dominates the glass deformation in fewer-pass scratching, while plastic damage and chemistry-enhanced material-removal together determine the final deformation volume for multi-pass scratching in humid air. The results presented in this study provide further insights into the physics of glass deformation.
613	Characteristics of mixing enhanced by using plasma-synthetic jet actuators in supersonic flow	Votical characteristics of mixing with existence of large scale vortices introduced by pulsed-plasma-synthetic jet array actuators in supersonic shear layer were investigated experimentally. The nanoparticle- based planar laser scattering method and particle image velocimetry are employed. The large scale structures caused by single pulse plasma-synthetic jet array actuators are successfully captured. The pulsed plasma-synthetic jet array actuators may be an effective tool for mixing layers in supersonic flow.
614	Transient dynamics of strongly coupled spin vortex pairs: effects of  anharmonicity and resonant excitation on inertial switching	Spin vortices in magnetic nanopillars are used as GHz oscillators, with frequency however essentially fixed in fabrication. We demonstrate a model system of a two-vortex nanopillar, in which the resonance frequency can be changed by an order of magnitude, without using high dc magnetic fields. The effect is due to switching between the two stable states of the vortex pair,which we show can be done with low-amplitude fields of sub-ns duration. We detail the relevant vortex-core dynamics and explain how field anharmonicity and phase control can be used to enhance the performance.
615	CO adsorption on nanoislands: Ni on Au(111)	The adsorption behavior of CO on Ni islands grown on Au(111) was studied with a combination of TPD, FTIR and surface resistivity measurements. The Au(111) herringbone reconstruction provides a template for the growth of ordered Ni islands, with evidence for the presence of strain and Au atoms within the islands. The islands grow radially until &#x03B8;_Ni&#x2248;0.3 ML, after which subsequent Ni atoms contribute primarily to a second layer. We study saturated CO adsorption at 227 K over a range of Ni island sizes, and find layer-dependent adsorption properties. For single-layer islands at low Ni coverage, CO adsorbs primarily in the atop position and desorbs at lower temperatures than on pure Ni, with a saturation CO coverage of about 0.5 CO/Ni. As second layer Ni grows, saturated CO coverages on the Ni approach unity, with higher desorption temperatures, but still with primarily atop CO. Based on previous studies, we propose that in the first Ni layer ligand effects from Au in the islands and strain due to the Ni/Au lattice mismatch affect the Ni-CO bonds. CO adsorption behavior on the two-layer islands is qualitatively explained by a decrease in Au concentration and the presence of a more expanded/corrugated structure.
616	Kinetically Controlled Dewetting of Thin GaAs Cap from An ErAs/GaAs Nanoparticle Composite Layer	ErAs metal nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in GaAs have multiple applications in plasmonic, terahertz, and tunneling devices. Growing high quality thin GaAs layer over the ErAs NP layer is vital to these applications. In this work, we study the surface stability of GaAs thin cap (1 to 5nm) on single layer of ErAs NPs grown using molecular beam epitaxy in a GaAs matrix. As grown GaAs at low temperature (450{degree sign}C) can be smooth, however, GaAs was found to dewet from ErAs NP layer with increasing temperature (&gt;500{degree sign}C) through the formation of clumps or pinholes depending on the layer thickness. Thermodynamically, this dewetting is driven by the high interfacial energy as a result of different crystal structures, however, as a kinetic factor, surface mobility plays important roles in the process. It has been demonstrated that the dewetting can be prevented by combining a higher As overpressure, a low growth/annealing temperature, lower surface coverage of ErAs NP, and thicker GaAs cap.
617	<strong>Microscale Mechanics of Nanoimprinted Polymer Microstructures</strong>	Nanoimprint has been an important nanofabrication technology that be widely adopted in various electronic, photonic and biomedical applications. During the nanoimprint process, the elevated temperature and high stress applied might lead to mechanical changes of imprinted polymeric materials. The mechanical properties of imprinted materials, especially those under microscale, play an important role in their stability and further industrial applications. In this study, nanoindentation was employed to quantitatively characterize the elastic moduli of PMMA patterned under various imprinting temperatures. We found that the elastic modulus would increase with the increase of embossing temperature, and this should be related to the increasing residual stress introduced by higher flow rate of polymer chains at higher temperature. Quantitative mapping of optical birefringence in imprinted polymer microstructures corroborated this observation. The microscale characterizations of polymeric microstructures by nanoindentation and optical retardation measurements can be useful in optimizing nanoimprinting parameters to achieve best service performance of imprinted polymer microstructures for MEMS applications.
618	Measurement of the Hall effect at nanoscale with three probes	The Hall effect and its varieties such as quantum, anomalous, and spin Hall effects, provide indispensable tools for the characterization of electronic and magnetic properties of materials, metrology, and spintronics. The conventional four-probe Hall configuration is generally not amenable to measurements at nanoscale, due to current shunting by the Hall electrodes. We demonstrate that Hall measurements on the nanoscale can be facilitated by the three-probe Hall configuration that avoids the shunting problem. We illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach with anomalous Hall effect-based measurements of individual activation events during domain wall motion in magnetic films with perpendicular anisotropy.
619	A Study of Plasma Induced Nanostructure Formation and Surface Morphology Changes on Tungsten at Atmospheric Pressure	The formation of nanostructures such as "fuzz", holes, and flakes were observed on stainless steel and tungsten anodes that in a 1 atm glow discharge with helium as the feed gas. The structures exhibited morphology similar to the tungsten fuzz growth observed in experiments that simulate wall conditions in fusion reactors, suggesting similar physics may be present in both scenarios.  The anode surface temperature ranged between 1000 and 1300 K with an ion fluence rate of order of 1024 s-1m-2.  In this work, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the evolution of nanostructure formation as a function of time.  Observed nanostructures were found to vary with the morphology of the discharge plasma attachment. The composition of the structures was found to be predominantly the native metal. This work gives some insight into the formation of nanostructures at atmospheric pressure which has not only applications for material processing but also provides potentially another avenue to study fuzz formation processes relevant to fusion plasma-wall interactions.
620	<strong>Transmission low-energy electron diffraction using double-gated single nanotip field emitter<sup></sup></strong>	We explore the spatial coherence of double-gate nanotip single field emitters by low-energy electron diffraction experiments in transmission mode.  This source has the capability of producing collimated electron beams well suited for diffraction. Bragg reflections from suspended graphene were successfully imaged by electrically switching field emission pulses.  This result was obtained without additional optics. In comparison to previous experiments using a double-gate nanotip array cathode, we observed sharper and higher resolution diffraction spots with the single-nanotip double-gate emitters. In particular, we found complete conservation of the size and the shape of the diffraction spots with those of the incident beam on the sample. The result indicates that the transverse coherence of such a nanofabricated double-gate single-tip emitter is much larger than a few nanometers as determined by the apparent diffraction spot size and overall spatial resolution based the observed diffraction pattern.
621	Strongly temperature-dependent recombination kinetics of negatively charged exciton in asymmetric quantum dots at 1.55 &mu;m	We report on strongly temperature-dependent kinetics of negatively charged carrier complexes in asymmetric InAs/AlGaInAs/InP quantum dots (dashes) emitting at telecom wavelengths. Studied structures are highly elongated and of large volume, which results in atypical carrier confinement characteristics with <em>s</em>-<em>p</em> shell energy splittings far below the optical phonon energy, which strongly affects the phonon-assisted electron relaxation. Probing the emission kinetics with time-resolved microphotoluminescence from a single structure, we observe a strongly non-monotonic temperature dependence of the charged exciton lifetime. It may be interpreted in terms of two thermally activated processes that slow down the recombination, separated by an abrupt drop of lifetime at T&asymp;30-50 K. Modeling the recombination cascade kinetics with rate equations, we find that a relaxation side-path through the excited charged exciton triplet states may lead to such a behavior. This, however, involves a singlet-triplet relaxation, for which efficient electron spin flip processes are needed. Hence, we interpret our results as an indirect observation of strongly enhanced electron spin relaxation without magnetic field, most possibly resulting from atypical confinement characteristics in the studied nanostructures.

The detailed characterization studies revealed that the as-synthesized samples were well-crystalline and accumulated by large amount of nanosheets with 25 nm thickness. The Eu ions were successfully doped into the ZnO nanosheets, and the red emissions of Eu<sup>3+</sup> ions attributed to the energy of <sup>5</sup>D<sub>0</sub>&rarr;<sup>7</sup>F<sub>0</sub>, <sup>5</sup>D<sub>0</sub>&rarr;<sup>7</sup>F<sub>1</sub> and <sup>5</sup>D<sub>0</sub>&rarr;<sup>7</sup>F<sub>2</sub><sub> </sub>4f&ndash;4f intrashell transitions were observed in PL spectra. It was also observed that the appropriate Eu doping could increase the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs and promote the formation of the superoxide ions during the photolysis process, which eventually improved the photodegradation of Rhodamine B under UV light irradiation. A pseudo first order rate was analyzed for the photocatalytic degradation of RhB. A possible explanation for the modification of bandgap was given based on the modified effect of Eu<sup>3+</sup> ions on the electronic structure of ZnO nanosheets, which mainly due to two mechanisms of Burstein-Moss effect and electron-ion/electron scattering.
623	Ab Initio and Theoretical Study on Electron Transport through Polyene Junctions in between Angled-cut Carbon Nanotubes	We investigate the surface Green's function and layer-by-layer local density of states (LDOS) of the armchair carbon nanotube (CNT) leads from the rim into the bulk tube. We find the 3-layer-cycle oscillation of the cross-cut cases, and that the angled-cut cases, exhibiting a zigzag rim at the cut, possess not only the oscillation, but also evanescent edge states that decay into the bulk tube.  We study the single-polyene and two-polyene molecular junctions bridging the angled-cut armchair CNT leads, with both ab initio and tight-binding model approaches, and look into the interference effect between effective transport channels.
624	<strong>Dual Functional Asymmetric Plasmonic Structures for Solar Water Purification and Pollution Detection</strong>	In the past decade, various rational designed plasmonic structures have demonstrated extraordinary functionalities from information, photothermal therapy to solar energy conversion. Recently, plasmon enhanced solar steam generation is attracting a lot of attention for its great potential in desalination, sterilization, etc. Here for the first time we demonstrate an asymmetric plasmonic structure (APS) formed by self-assembly of close packed silver nanoparticles into porous templates with dual functions, solar water purification and pollution detection. The dark porous side of the APS can enable efficient solar steam generation (with energy transfer efficiency ~ 80%) while the shiny metallic side can enable sensitive chemicals detection (with detection limit down to ~ 10<sup>-12</sup> M). Such impressive performance in solar thermal conversion and chemical sensing are stemmed from the broadband and efficient light absorption (solar absorptivity &gt; 90%) as well as pronounced local field enhancement (maximal enhancement factor ~ 10<sup>9</sup>), respectively. As an example of functional integration, this dual functional APS can enable on-site pollution detection and purification of water: water sources contaminated with various kinds of common pollutants have been examined and purified. Both functions of detection and purification exhibit long time durable performance up to ~ 45 days, with &lt; 20% decay in Raman intensity and &lt; 10% decay in energy transfer efficiency, respectively.
625	<strong>Realization of strain-induced giant polychromatic emission in ZnO nanostructures for white light emitting diode application</strong>	In this letter, we report that flower shaped architecture of ZnO assembled by individual nanopetals of an average thickness ~ 93 nm has been achieved by selective self &ndash; etching method.  ZnO nanopetals prepared at 80&deg;C exhibit enhanced polychromatic defect emissions of blue, green and red (BGR) as compared to samples annealed at higher temperatures and the maximum intensity values for BGR are 4.06 &ndash; 4.80 &times;10<sup>6</sup>, 4.89 &times;10<sup>6</sup> and 3.56 &times;10<sup>6 </sup>cps, respectively. These values are much greater than the previous reports in such a way that it is something spectacular to be witnessed. The improved luminescence intensity of BGR is attributed to the higher lattice strain and dislocation density induced in ZnO due to native defects. As the annealing temperature is reduced, the dislocation density increases from 7.60 &times;10<sup>13</sup> to 3.99&times;10<sup>15 </sup>lines/m<sup>2</sup>, whilst, lattice strain increases from 0.0079&times;10<sup>-3</sup> to 1.81&times;10<sup>-3</sup>. The observed high luminescence emission is due to flower shaped architecture making it suitable for the fabrication of solid- state white light emitting diodes.
626	<strong><sup>Bismuth Ferrites/MXene Nanocomposites for Efficient Dye Degradation</sup></strong>	Nanohybrids, made up of Bismuth ferrites/Carbon allotropes, are extensively used in photocatalytic applications nowadays. Our work proposes a nanohybrid system composed of Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles with two-dimensional (2D) MXene sheets namely, the BiFeO<sub>3</sub> (BFO)/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (MXene) nanohybrid for enhanced photocatalytic activity. We have fabricated the BFO/MXene nanohybrid using simple and low cost hydrothermal method. The   SEM and TEM images show that the BFO nanoparticles were attached onto the MXene surface and in the inter-layers of two-dimensional (2D) MXene sheets. The photocatalytic application is tested for the visible light irradiation which showed the highest efficiency among all pure-BFO based photocatalysts, i.e. 100% degradation in 42 min for colored organic dye (Congo red) and colorless organic dye (acetophenone) in 140 min, respectively. The present BFO-based hybrid system exhibited the largest surface area (147 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>-1</sup>) reported till date measured via Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) sorption-desorption technique. Also, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra presented here is a highly efficient photocatalyst compared to other nanostructures based on pure BiFeO<sub>3</sub> which makes it a promising candidate for many future applications indicate large electron-hole pair generation. The larger surface area and higher electron-hole pair generation provides suitable environment for fast photo-degradation of organic molecules. The BFO/MXene nanohybrid
627	<strong>Synthesis and i</strong><strong>ntrinsic magnetism </strong><strong>of</strong><strong> bilayer graphene nanoribbons</strong>	Pristine bilayer graphene nanoribbons (BLGNRs) with the average width of ca. 9 nm were obtained by longitudinal unzipping the oxalic acid-intercalated double-walled carbon nanotubes followed by annealing at 900 <sup>o</sup>C. The magnetic properties of BLGNRs were investigated. The results reveal that BLGNRs show obvious antiferromagnetic behavior with the N&eacute;el temperature of ca. 66 K. It is proposed that (i) the spin-polarized edge states are the dominant magnetic source, and (ii) the antiferromagnetism is mainly caused by the interlayer couplings.
628	Self-generation of Ag nanoparticle mechanism during Ag sintering process	Self-generation of Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) with a size less than 10 nm was observed in the Ag sintering process under an air atmosphere, which corresponds to a stronger sintered Ag tension and shear strength than that sintered in nitrogen. It is confirmed that oxygen plays an important role in the generation of AgNPs, which leading to the oxidation processes of Ag grains and the compression stress release at the grain boundaries. Self-generation AgNPs accumulated around the grains and grain boundaries and thus promotes connection and necking between Ag grains during sintering process.
629	<strong>Nanofuel droplet combustion: insights into droplet burning time scale, secondary atomisation and coupling of droplet deformations and heat release</strong>	Combustion characteristics of ethanol-water droplets laden with ceria (CeO<sub>2</sub>) nanoparticle (NP) is investigated in the current work. Using simultaneous high speed shadowgraphy and flame OH* chemiluminescence imaging, spatio-temporal variation of droplet shape and heat release (HR) is analysed.  Present experimental study focuses on three facets of droplet combustion <strong>(i)</strong> burning time scale of droplets with and without NPs, <strong>(ii)</strong> pathways of secondary atomisation and <strong>(iii)</strong> Coupling of droplet shape deformations and flame heat release. A semi-analytical timescale is advocated which incorporates natural convection-based evaporation and mass loss due to daughter droplet ejections. For droplets seeded with ceria NPs, period following initial heat-up exhibit arrested surface undulations although internal ebullition is discernibly enhanced. Formation of gelatinous sheath on nanofuel droplet surface during this period is observed. Presence of this skeletal network provides an analogy with solvent evaporation through porous media. Hence, for nanofuel droplets, semi-analytical time scales are evaluated considering both pure evaporation and flow through porous media. Deformations in EW droplets are traced to the imbalance between local vapour recoil and surface tension leading to surface craters. This pathway of secondary atomisation of EW droplets has been elucidated using a modified local weber number  . We propose a theoretical velocity scale of the ligament which turns out to be of same order as the experimental findings. Proper orthogonal technique is utilised for investigating droplet shape and flame HR evolution. Modal analysis of EW and nanoceria droplet reveals presence of chaotic deviations from mean geometry. Nanoceria exhibit arrested surface fluctuations.
630	Low temperature plasmas induced in SF6 by extreme ultraviolet (EUV) pulses	In this work a comparative study of EUV induced, low temperature SF6 - based plasmas, created using two different irradiation systems, was performed. Both systems utilized laser-produced plasma (LPP) EUV sources. The essential difference between the systems concerned formation of the driving, EUV beam. The first one contained an efficient ellipsoidal EUV collector allowing for focusing of the EUV radiation at a large distance from the LPP source. The spectrum of focused radiation was limited to the long-wavelength part of the total LPP emission, &#x03BB; &gt; 8 nm due to reflective properties of the collector. The second system did not contain any EUV collector. The gas to be ionized was injected in the vicinity of the LPP, at a distance of the order of 10 mm. In both systems energies of the driving photons were high enough for dissociative ionization of the SF6 molecules, ionization of atoms or even singly charged ions. Plasmas, created due to these processes, were investigated by spectral measurements in the EUV, ultraviolet (UV) and visible (VIS) spectral ranges. These low temperature plasmas were employed for preliminary experiments concerning surface treatment. Formation of pronounced nanostructures on the silicon surface after the plasma treatment were demonstrated.
631	Spin-relaxation anisotropy in a nanowire quantum dot with strong spin-orbit coupling	We study the impacts of the magnetic field direction on the spin-manipulation and the spin-relaxation in a one-dimensional quantum dot with strong spin-orbit coupling. The energy spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions in the quantum dot are obtained exactly. We find that no matter how large the spin-orbit coupling is, the electric-dipole spin transition rate as a function of the magnetic field direction always has a &#x03C0; periodicity. However, the phonon-induced spin relaxation rate as a function of the magnetic field direction has a &#x03C0; periodicity only in the weak spin-orbit coupling regime, and the periodicity is prolonged to 2&#x03C0; in the strong spin-orbit coupling regime.
632	Increasing the refractive index of materials via nanolamination - a-IGZO/TiO<sub>2</sub> superlattices	We investigate nanolamination as a means of increasing the refractive index of materials, with a focus on [a-IGZO/TiO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>i</sub> nanolaminates as composite transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) with tuneable index. We demonstrate that by periodic layering with TiO<sub>2</sub> the refractive index of a-IGZO can be increased by up to &#x0394;n~0.39 while the carrier mobility and conductivity retain 70% of their original values. This is shown to be a result of the alignment of the conduction bands of the a-IGZO and TiO<sub>2</sub>. We also use optical modeling to verify the integral refractive index behaviour of the nanolaminates and outline its range of applicability.
633	Deformation behaviors in Au nanotubes under torsion by molecular dynamics simulations	In this study, the mechanical deformation behaviors of Au nanotubes (Au-NTs) under torsional stress are investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The inter-atomic interaction is modeled using the embedded-atom potential. In particular, the effects of loading rate, thickness and length of the nanotube, as well as the thermal effects were systematically explored. The results indicated that higher loading rate, longer length and thinner wall thickness all led to a larger value of critical torsional angle (<em>&theta;</em><sub>cr</sub>), which signifies the onset of plastic deformation. On the other hand, <em>&theta;</em><sub>cr</sub> decreases with increasing temperature in all simulated results. Moreover, the torsional buckling deformation behavior and geometrical instability are found to strongly depend on the length of Au-NTs, the applied strain rate and temperature with vastly different underlying mechanisms.
634	<strong>Weak Enhanced Resonant Faraday Rotation in Pure Cobalt Plasmonic Lattices: Thickness Dependent Faraday Rotation Studies</strong>	The thickness dependent magneto-optical Faraday rotation in Co ferromagnetic thin films and perforated periodic Co nano-hole arrays were investigated. It was observed that the optical response and Faraday rotation of Co nano-hole arrays were strongly dependent on the thickness of the film, and the Faraday rotation reached the maximum amplitude at an optimal thickness value of 30 nm to 50 nm, which contrasted with the Co thin films where the Faraday rotation increased with the film thickness. In addition, the Faraday rotation spectra of Co nano-hole arrays showed a weak resonantly enhanced peak at the anti-resonance modes (or Wood&rsquo;s anomalies) on the transmission spectra, which correspond to the localized surface plasmon resonances at the film and surrounding medium interfaces. All experimental results were confirmed by the finite-difference time domain calculations.
635	<strong>Apparent toughening in Ti-Al-N coatings by phase transformation stresses</strong>	<SPAN style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 150%;">The formation of hcp (ZnS-wurtzite type) AlN precipitates, due to the decomposition of supersaturated fcc (NaCl-type) Ti-Al-N coatings upon annealing, causes the residual macrostresses to increase from -3.9&plusmn;0.3 GPa (as-deposited) to -5.2&plusmn;0.3 GPa (annealed at 900 &deg;C), as determined by X-ray diffraction. This leads to an apparent increase in fracture toughness (K<sub>IC</sub>) &ndash; obtained by cube corner nanoindenation experiments &ndash; from the as-deposited value of ~4.4 MPa&radic;m to ~8.0 MPa&radic;m when annealed at 900 &deg;C. This assessment is supported by studying the phase transformation induced stresses by continuum mechanics modelling using Transformation Field Analysis.</SPAN>
636	Promoting single-file DNA translocations through nanopores usingselectroosmotic flow	Double-stranded DNA translocates through sufficiently large nanopores either in a linear, single-file fashion or in a folded hairpin conformation when captured somewhere along its length. We show that the folding state of DNA can be controlled by changing the electrolyte concentration, pH and PEG content of the measurement buffer. At 1M LiCl or 0.35M KCl in neutral pH, single-file translocations make up more than 90% of the total. We attribute the effect to the onset of electroosmotic flow from the pore at low ionic strength. Our hypothesis on the critical role of flows is supported by the preferred orientation of entry of a strand that has been folded into a multi-helix structure at one end. Control over DNA folding is critical for nanopore sensing approaches that use modifications along a DNA strand and the associated secondary current drops to encode information.
637	Variable Range Hopping Conduction in ZnO Nanocrystal Thin Films	Both Mott and Efros-Shklovskii variable range hopping models have been applied to films of semiconductor nanocrystals to describe their temperature-dependent conductivity. Adding an infill tends to increase conductivity, although the mechanism is uncertain. This paper uses UV exposure to control the carrier concentration by dosing and controllably desorbing surface hydroxyls. This provides a method for obtaining sufficient information to develop a detailed model for how electronic properties are affected by infill in films of ZnO nanocrystals. The technique allows one to transition between the two conduction mechanisms and so extract fundamental parameters of the materials. It is found that the removal of OH increases the localization length but does not significantly change the Fermi level. A model that explains these results is the existence of a quasi-neutral core surrounded by a shell depleted by surface OH trap states. As OH is removed, the core expands. Without infill the edge of the quasi-neutral region approaches the diameter of the NC. The NC-NC interfaces most likely to conduct current are close proximity crystal facets. Delocalization across facets is less complete for infilled samples. This may be due to two effects incomplete facet infill and the subsequent sealing of these spaces. The results suggest that, while the average carrier concentration in the NCs increase with infill and with removal of OH, the primary source of the increased conductivity is an increase in the ability to tunnel from NC to NC due to a reduction in the distance between quasi-neutral cores.
638	Wafer-scale, Stretchable Nanomeshes from an Ultrathin-Support-Layer Assisted Transfer	Metal nanomeshes possess unique electrical and mechanical properties for next&#x2011;generation stretchable electronics. However, a critical unmet need lies in producing stretchable conductive nanomeshes at large scale with high uniformity and intactness. Here we present a wafer-scale nondestructive transfer method by utilizing an ultrathin polyimide layer. This polyimide support layer allows etchant vapor to transmit through to etch the sacrificial layer underneath, while being continuous to support the nanomeshes during transfer and then is removed completely after the transfer. From this simple yet effective method, we developed 4&#x2011;inch-wafer-scale gold nanomeshes with low sheet resistance of 8.35 &#x2126;/&#x25A1;, good transparency of 65% at 550 nm, and stretchability of 70%. Detailed vapor transmission studies reveal that etchant vapor indeed transmitted through the support layer, with realistic sacrificial etching time needed for transfer. Together, these results provide a practical pathway towards fabricating large-scale nanomesh based stretchable electronics, with applications ranging from skin-on electronics to implantable biomedical devices. We also expect this ultrathin support layer approach to be generally applicable to the processing of many other nanomaterials at large scale.
639	GaAs Solar Cells on Nanopatterned Si Substrates	Integrating III-Vs onto Si is a promising route towards tandem photovoltaics and cost mitigation of III-V substrates. While many III-V/Si photovoltaic integration approaches have been studied, epitaxial growth on Si allows for fewer processing steps compared to other approaches. However, current epitaxial pathways utilize expensive techniques, such as thermal cycle annealing or thick buffer layers to control defect densities, undermining the low-cost goal of integrating III-Vs with Si. Here, we present single-junction GaAs solar cells grown directly on Si using selective area growth as an alternative low-cost technique to control material quality with a much thinner buffer. We demonstrate a 10.4%-efficient GaAs device grown on a V-grooved Si substrate which achieved an antiphase domain-free III-V/Si interface and a threading dislocation density of 2&times;10<sup>7</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>, despite the lack of a graded buffer. We compare this growth on V-grooved Si to solar cells grown on polished Si with and without a patterned silica buffer layer, which demonstrate efficiencies of 6.5% and 6.8%, respectively; the polished Si was patterned using nanoimprint lithography, which is a low-cost patterning technique compatible with III-V selective area growth. Cracking is found to be a critical challenge that hinders solar cell performance, and is exacerbated by the V-grooved Si surface topography. The results in this paper provide a promising pathway towards high-efficiency, low-cost III-V/Si tandem photovoltaics.
640	Synthesis of 15-nm-diameter silver nanowires via a pressure-induced polyol method using AgCl-KBr co-salts: Evolution of low haze-transparent electrode two-dimensional films	We synthesized Ag nanowires (Ag NWs) with diameters ranging from 15 to 45-nm via a pressure-induced polyol method. By optimizing the pressure, we effectively controlled the increase in the thickness of Ag NWs without influencing the longitudinal direction. Under a pressure of 1000 psi, in the present of AgCl-KBr co-salts, ultra-thin sub-15-nm-diameter Ag NWs was obtained. These two-dimensional Ag NW network film exhibited considerably high transmittance (over 90%) and considerably low haze values (1.5% or less) despite the low sheet resistance (10 &#xF057;/sq.). This performance is comparable to that of crystalline indium-tin-oxide glass with the same sheet resistance.
641	<strong>Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Performance of InGaN-based Nanowire Photoanodes by Optimizing the Ionized Dopant Concentration </strong>	InGaN-based nanowires (NWs) have been extensively studied for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting devices owing to their tunable bandgap and good chemical stability. Here, we further investigated the influence of Si doping on the PEC performance of InGaN-based NW photoanodes. The Si dopant concentration was controlled by tuning the Si effusion cell temperature (T<sub>Si</sub>) during plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PA-MBE) growth and further estimated by Mott-Schottky electrochemical measurements. The highest Si dopant concentration of 2.1&times;10<sup>18</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> was achieved at T<sub>Si</sub>=1120 &deg;C, and the concentration decreased with further increases in T<sub>Si</sub>. The flat-band potential was calculated and used to estimate the conduction and valence band edge potentials of the Si-doped InGaN-based NWs. The band edge potentials were found to seamlessly straddle the redox potentials of water splitting. The linear scan voltammetry results were consistent with the estimated carrier concentration. The InGaN-based NWs doped with Si at T<sub>Si</sub>=1120 &deg;C exhibited the highest current density (1.97 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> at 1.597 V vs NHE), which was 15 times higher than that of the undoped sample. Our systematic findings suggest that the PEC performance can be significantly improved by optimizing the Si doping level of InGaN-based NW photoanodes.
642	<SPAN style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 200%; color: blue;">Experimental and Modeling Investigation on the Self-propagating Combustion Behavior of Al-MoO<sub>3</sub> Reactive Multilayer Films</SPAN>	In order to probe the self-propagating combustion behavior of aluminum/molybdenum trioxide (Al/MoO<sub>3</sub>) reactive multilayer films (RMFs), RMFs with varied modulation periods and widths were deposited by magnetron sputtering method on glass substrate. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed that thermal reaction was in solid-solid phase at nanoscale modulation periods (50 nm and 150 nm), and in liquid-solid phase at microscale (1500 nm). Meanwhile, the peak temperature reduced with thinner modulation period, while the heat release of RMFs-1500 nm was less compared with 50 nm and 150 nm suggesting incomplete reaction. Further since X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis demonstrated the presence of aluminum oxide, the hot spot and pre-oxidation theory of interface in Al/MoO<sub>3</sub> RMFs allowed logical explanation of thermal reaction feature. The RMFs achieved stable self-propagating combustion at nanoscale modulation periods excited by a laser pulse, but not at microscale. The average stable combustion velocity was 6 m/s in 150 nm modulation period and reached 10 m/s for 50 nm. The two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated that effect of width on combustion velocity was not significant. Thus, we constructed a one-dimensional (1D) combustion velocity model based on heat transfer theory combing experimental data. The model explored relationship between stable combustion velocity and modulation period and verified that self-propagating combustion velocity was likely controlled by the thermal conduction of substrates.
643	<strong>Growth of ordered arrays of vertical free-standing VO<sub>2</sub> nanowires on nanoimprinted Si</strong>	In recent years, the synthesis and study of individual single-crystal VO<sub>2</sub> nanowires (NWs) have been attracting much interest due to the unique properties of the material related with the single-domain metal-insulator phase transition in such NWs. Although single-crystal VO<sub>2</sub> NWs offer much promise for practical applications, the lack of a technology for forming NW arrays and, especially, ordered arrays of VO<sub>2</sub> NWs still does not permit the mass fabrication of novel VO<sub>2</sub>-based devices and materials. Here, we break this barrier and synthesized ordered arrays of free-standing single-crystal monoclinic VO<sub>2</sub> NWs. Vertically aligned, strongly periodic VO<sub>2</sub> NWs were obtained in a CVD process used to grow VO<sub>2</sub> on nanoimprinted Si substrate. Indicative of a high quality of obtained NW is a sharp rise of conductivity at the phase transition in VO<sub>2</sub> reaching in magnitude four orders as well as a pronounced faceting of the crystals confirmed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Our approach paves the way toward a broad application of VO<sub>2</sub> single crystals with desired sizes, shape, and aspect ratio in various fields of nanophotonics and nanoelectronics, and in smart materials.
644	<strong>Precise nanothermal measurements via spatially distributed scanning thermal microscope probes</strong>	Advances in materials design and device miniaturization lead to physical properties that may significantly differ from the bulk ones. In particular, thermal transport is strongly affected when the device dimensions approach the mean free path of heat carriers. Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) is arguably the best approach for probing nanoscale thermal properties with few tens of nm lateral resolution. Typical SThM probes based on a microfabricated Pd resistive probes (PdRP) using a spatially distributed heater and a nanoscale tip in contact with the sample, provide high sensitivity and operation in ambient, vacuum and liquid environments. However, the response of this sensor has been poorly studied, impeding its precision and stability, and, ultimately, impeding the quantitative measurements. Here we build an analytical model of the PdRP sensor taking into account finite dimensions of the heater. While it has been previously assumed that the probe response is identical for heat flowing through a tip to the sample or due to probe self-heating &ndash; here we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that they can differ by more than 50%, hence introducing significant error in the SThM measurements. Furthermore, we analyzed the effect of environmental parameters such as sample and microscope stage temperatures, and laser illumination, allowed to reduce the experimental scatter by a factor of 10. Finally, varying these parameters, we measured absolute values of heat resistances and compared these to the model for both ambient and vacuum SThM operation, providing a comprehensive pathway improving the precision of the nanothermal measurements in SThM.
645	In situ Voltage-Application System for Active Voltage Contrast Imaging in Helium Ion Microscope	To develop a new electrical potential observation method, we constructed a system whereby helium ion microscope (HIM) observations can be performed while applying any voltage (about {plus minus}5 V) to a sample. The in situ voltage-application system is operated in a high vacuum HIM chamber and consists of a transfer rod, tilt joint, x-, y-, and z-axis mechanisms, and two probes at the end of the transfer rod. We acquired secondary electron (SE) images of the cross-sectional surfaces of multilayer ceramic capacitor (MLCC) with voltages (from 0.5 V to 5 V) applied to the internal electrodes of the MLCC by using the new system. The active voltage contrast corresponding to the electrical potential in the SE images could be observed when the applied voltage is less than or equal to 1.5 V. This technique enables any voltage to be applied to the samples from outside the chamber and can be used to measure nanometer-scale electrical potential distribution of Li-ion rechargeable batteries, solar cells, etc.
646	Fabrication and characterization of urea biosensor using CuO/ZnO based diode	This paper presents fabrication of a compact and low cost printed circuit board (PCB) based urea biosensor using a circular sized indium tinoxide (ITO) coated glass as working electrode. For this, ITO coated glass was subjected to etching using 50 % concentrated sulphuric acid at temperature of 50 &#x02DA;C with a suitable mask to protect the circuit area.  A silver layer was developed around the ITO working electrode on the same glass by thermal evaporation technique and then AgCl paste was coated on the Ag layer for the preparation of Ag/AgCl as reference electrode. A thin layer of mixture of nanostructured copper oxide (Nano-CuO) and nanostructured zinc oxide (Nano-ZnO) was deposited using electrophoretic deposition method on the said working electrode. Urease (Enzyme) was immobilized on the working electrode surface by physical adsorption technique via glutareldehyde as cross-linker. Electrochemical response of this urea bioelectrode was recorded by Keithley Source Meter (KSM) for different urea concentration from 0.1 to 100 mM. This Nano-CuO/Nano-ZnO urea bioelectrode was found to have sensitivity of 488 uA/mM/cm2, shelf life of 180 days under normal laboratory condition and lower limit of detection of 35 uM. This method requires only a small amount of urease~ 2 &#x00B5;l and no extra buffer saline for test. Such small sized nanostructured urea biosensor with high commercial impact can be easily fabricated and mass produced using this methodology.
647	Numerical solution for MHD flow of micropolar nanofluid in the presence of nonlinear thermal radiation and activation energy	The effects of variable thermal conductivity, radiative heat flux, activation energy, viscous dissipation, Ohmic dissipation and MHD on an incompressible micropolar nanofluid flowing over a stretching sheet have been debated in detail. The nonlinaer partial diffential equations (PDEs) for momentum, energy, microrotation and nanoparticle concentration are discussed. These PDEs are converted to a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by utilizing an appropriate transformation and then tackled numerically with the help of shooting method and the MATLAB  built-in solver bvp4c. It is canvassed that by augmenting the microrotation parameter, a boost in the angular velocity profile is seen. The values of sundry parameters like microrotation, Prandtl number, Lewis number, activation energy, thermal conductivity, radiation parameter, Schmidt number, thermophoresis parameter and Brownian motion parameter have been delineated across the velocity profile, angular velocity profile and nanoparticle concentration profiles.
648	Strain Rate and Temperature Dependence of the Mechanical Properties of Polymers: A Universal Time-Temperature Superposition Principle	Establishing the Time-Temperature and Frequency-Temperature Superposition Principles (TTSP and FTSP) to describe the mechanical behavior of polymeric materials is always of paramount significance. In this work, by adopting the classic coarse-grained model, we investigate the validity of these superposition principles for a series of networks; such as the pure polymer network, interpenetrating polymer networks composed of stiff and flexible networks (IPNs-SF), interpenetrating polymer networks composed of different crosslinking networks (IPNs-DC), polymer nanocomposites (PNCs), and surface grafting modified PNCs. The study focuses on the three critical mechanical properties such as the stress relaxation, the storage modulus versus the frequency obtained from the dynamic periodic shear deformation, and the uniaxial tensile stress-strain. The glass transition temperature (Tg) is 0.47 for the simulated polymer network (CL400) and a smooth master curve is obtained for the stress relaxation process by setting Tg as the reference temperature via the horizontal shifting process, indicating the validity of TTSP. Importantly, the Arrhenius and WLF equations are both adopted to quantitatively analyze the TTSP behavior. Furthermore, similar smooth master curves are also achieved for both dynamic periodic shear and uniaxial tensile deformation. Based on the Eyring equation, we establish a quantitative equation between the temperature and the strain rate within a certain range, which is used to obtain a smooth master curve for the stress-strain behavior. For the three mechanical properties, we emphasize that the master curve from TTSP or FTSP is independent of the reference temperature if it is higher than Tg, and based on the linear relation of the shift factor versus the inverse of the temperature higher than Tg, we propose a universal framework for the description of the TTSP or FTSP on the various mechanical properties. Then, we verify that the TTSP seems to be valid for the IPNs-DC system, while it does not hold for both PNCs and IPNs-SF systems because of their structural and dynamic heterogeneity. Furthermore, for PNCs filled with NPs grafted with polymer chains, the TTSP recovers back to be valid because of the enhanced compatibility between polymer and NPs attributed to the grafted polymer chains.
649	Wetting of Chemically Heterogeneous Striped Surfaces: Molecular Dynamics Simulations	Using molecular dynamics simulations, we thoroughly investigated the wetting behaviors of a chemically heterogeneous striped substrate patterned with two different wetting materials, face-centered cubic gold and face-centered cubic silver, at the nanoscale by analyzing the influences on the density distribution, normal stress distribution, surface tensions, and contact angle of a water droplet placed on the substrate. We found that the density and stress profile of the water droplet near the substrate-water interface were noticeably affected by altering the gold and silver contents in the substrate. Specifically, a greater portion of gold (more wetting) or smaller portion of silver (less wetting) in the substrate composition induced higher densities and higher normal stresses in the vicinity of the substrate surface. Also, it was observed that the surface tensions at liquid-vapor interface and solid-vapor interface were not largely impacted by the change of the substrate composition while the solid-liquid surface tension decreased exponentially with increasing fraction of gold. Most importantly, we found that contact angle of a nanometer-sized water droplet resting on the chemically heterogeneous striped substrate does not show linear dependence on corresponding surface fractions like that predicted by Cassie-Baxter model at the macro-scale. Consequently, we proposed a method for successfully predicting the contact angle by including the critical effects of the substrate heterogeneity on both surface tensions and line tension at the three-phase contact line of the water droplet and the chemically striped substrate.
650	Electrospun PVA polymer embedded with ceria nanoparticles as silicon solar cells rare surface coaters for efficiency improvement	This paper introduces electrospun nanofibers embedded with ceria nanoparticles as silicon solar cells coaters, showing their influence on the solar cells efficiency. Ceria nanoparticles can be synthesized to have formed oxygen vacancies (O-vacancies) which are associated with converting cerium ions from the Ce4+ state ions to the Ce3+ ones. These O-vacancies follow the rule of improving silicon solar cells conductivity through hopping mechanism. Besides, under near-ultra violet (near-UV) excitation, the reduced trivalent cerium Ce3+ ions are directly responsible for down converting the un-absorbed UV wavelengths to a resulted green fluorescence emission at ~520nm which are absorbed through the silicon solar cells active layer. When electrospun PVA embedded with ceria nanoparticles on the silicon solar cell, a promising enhancement in the behavior of solar cells I-V curve has observed. The efficiency has improved by about 24% of its initial value due to the mutual impact of improving both electric conductivity and optical conversions from both PVA nanofibers and the embedded ceria nanoparticles.
651	<strong>All-optical switch and transistor based on coherent light-controlling-light of a single two-level atom coupling with two nanowires</strong>	Atom-nanowire strong coupling system is a promising platform for optical quantum information processing. In this paper, three contributions of atomic nonlinearity are specified explicitly for two coherent double-pump drives for the first time. It brings us a new approach to manipulating a strong light with a weak light, which is fundamental to all-optical switch and transistor. An optically controllable switch and transistor without gain medium based on coherent controlling light with light have been proposed at single-atom level in this work. Our findings show potential applications in full-optical devices.
652	<strong>Disorder Enhanced Thermal Conductivity Anisotropy in Two-Dimensional Materials and van der Waals Heterostructures</strong>	Two-dimensional (2D) materials and van der Waals heterostructures can naturally function as directional heat spreaders in nanoelectronics due to their intrinsically anisotropic structure. In real nanoelectronics applications, disorders usually appear in those materials where their effects on anisotropic thermal conductivity are not well-understood. We built simple graphite-like materials models and systematically incorporated mass disorder or structural disorder into the structures. The anisotropic thermal conductivities calculated by equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations show that mass disorder and stacking disorder can effectively and anisotropically tune the thermal conductivity of 2D materials and van der Waals heterostructures. Compared with the pristine graphite, the through-plane thermal conductivity can be reduced up to two orders of magnitude by the through-plane mass disorder and the thermal anisotropy ratio (i.e., the ratio of in-plane to through-plane thermal conductivity) can be enhanced more than ten times.  We attribute this counter-intuitive result to the dramatic decrease of phonon group velocity in the through-plane direction. Our results can shed some lights in the thermal management in electronics incorporating 2D materials and van der Waals heterostructures.
653	<strong>Constructing heterostructure of MX<sub>2</sub> (M=Zr, Hf; X=S, Se) for improved  optoelectronics  and  high-temperature thermoelectrics</strong>	Integrating various two-dimensional monolayers into diverse van der Waals heterostructures with functions has emerged at the cutting edge of nanoscale material research. In the present study, first-principles calculations combined with semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory have been applied to investigate the electronic and thermoelectric properties of van der Waals heterostructures consisting of MX<sub>2</sub> (M= Zr, Hf and X= S, Se) monolayers. Type-II band alignment is readily available between ZrS<sub>2</sub> and HfSe<sub>2</sub>, facilitating charge separation for optoelectronics and solar energy conversion. All studied heterostructures possesses remarkably higher electrical conductivity and larger power factor values at 1200 K, showing great potentials for future efficient high-temperature thermoelectrics.
654	Flexoelectricity in a metal/ferroelectric/semiconductor heterostructure	The flexoelectricity in a 100 nm-thick BaTiO<sub>3</sub> (BTO) thin film based metal/ferroelectric insulator/semiconductor (MFS) heterostructure was reported in this letter. The transverse flexoelectric coefficient of the BTO thin film in the heterojunction structure was measured to be 287-418 &micro;C/m at room temperature, and its temperature dependence shows that the flexoelectric effect in the BTO thin film was dominated in the paraelectric phase. We showed that the BTO thin film capacitance could be controlled at multi-levels by introducing ferroelectric and flexoelectric polarization in the film. These results are promising for understanding the flexoelectricity in epitaxial ferroelectric thin films, and the enhanced flexoelectricity poses great potential in nanoscale devices.
655	<strong>Magnetoresistance in CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/BiFeO<sub>3</sub> Core-Shell Nanoparticles Near Room Temperature</strong>	A systematic study of near room temperature magnetoresistance (MR) behavior is carried out for CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-BiFeO<sub>3</sub> core-shell nanoparticles, which in an earlier study were found to be magnetoelectric active [J. Appl. Phys. 123, 064101 (2018)]. The analysis of MR data reveals that the MR is guided by anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect. GMR effect is predominant in sample having maximum shell thickness whereas; the AMR effect dominates the least shell thickness and bare CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Analysis of the MR data in conjunction with the resistivity, suggests that the electrical conduction in these samples is due (a) tunneling and (b) hopping of electron across the domains. The impedance and modulus spectra analysis shows that the core-shell particles as a whole is participating in the relaxation process, thus indicating a strong coupling between the core and shell, which may be highly desirable while fetching its magnetoelectric based applications.
656	Bismuth Ferrites/MXene Nanocomposites for Efficient Dye Degradation	Our work proposes a nanohybrid system of Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles with two-dimensional (2D) MXene sheets namely, the BiFeO3 (BFO)/Ti3C2 (MXene) nanohybrid for enhanced photocatalytic activity. We have fabricated the BFO/MXene nanohybrid using hydrothermal method. The SEM and TEM images show that the BFO nanoparticles were attached onto the MXene surface and in the inter-layers of two-dimensional (2D) MXene sheets. The photocatalytic application is tested for the visible light irradiation which showed the highest efficiency among all pure-BFO based photocatalysts, i.e. 100% degradation in 42 min for colored organic dye (Congo red) and colorless organic dye (acetophenone) in 140 min, respectively.
657	<strong>Amorphous aluminum-oxide supercapacitors</strong>	<strong>An amorphous</strong><strong> aluminum</strong><strong>-oxide device could store a large amount of electric charge on its blackish, uneven Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3-x</sub> surface, which had a convexity of 21 nm, a concavity of 10 nm, AlO<sub>6</sub> clusters, and a high resistivity of 16.5 G&Omega;cm. The electric storage can be elucidated by extreme enhanced electron trapping resulting from both the quantum-size effect and the offset effect from positive charges at oxygen-vacancy sites.

659	A laboratory X-ray microscopy study of cracks in on-chip interconnect stacks of integrated circuits	Laboratory transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM) with a spatial resolution of about 100 nm was used to image 3D interconnect structures and failures in microchips during mechanical loading, applied by a novel micro double cantilever beam (micro-DCB) test. High-resolution 3D image sequences based on nano X-ray computed tomography (nano-XCT) are used to visualize crack opening and propagation in fully integrated multilevel on-chip interconnect structures of integrated circuits. The non-destructive investigation of sub-micron cracks during the in-situ micro-DCB test allows to identify the weakest layers and interfaces, delamination along Cu/dielectrics interfaces (adhesive failure) and fracture in dielectrics (cohesive failure), as well as to evaluate the robustness of Backend-of-Line (BEoL) stacks against process-induced thermomechanical stress.
660	<strong>High thermal conductivity and superior thermal Stability of amorphous PMDA/ODA nanofiber</strong>	The applications of polymers and their nanocomposites for thermal dissipation/management are limited by their low thermal conductivity and inferior thermal stability due to their disordered molecular chains. In this paper, we demonstrate experimentally the high thermal conductivity in individual suspended PMDA/ODA nanofiber which is fabricated by the typical electrospinning technology. More interestingly, the PMDA/ODA nanofibers possess high temperature thermal stability up to <em>T</em>=450K, far beyond the hot spot temperature of integrated circuits. The observed high thermal conductivity and high temperature thermal stability enable PMDA/ODA nanofibers to be a potential candidate for efficient TIMs in the future applications.
661	Structural Surface Waves Properties of Amorphous-State Bi2Te3 by Pulsed Laser Deposition in Visible and Near-Infrared regions	Owing to the unique properties of evanescent field, surface waves show great applications in near field enhancement and the break of the resolution limit. In this work, we found the amorphous-state Bi2Te3 film deposited by Pulsed Laser Depositions exhibits properties of surface waves in an ultrawide waveband from visible to near-infrared regions. We analysis the surface wave in the three respects: the propagation form, localized form and the coupling with a gold nanobar. This work not only breaks the strict limit of Bi2Te3 topological insulator crystalline but also widens the wavelength region of surface waves compared with the previous report.
662	Shaping and functionalizing models for chemically powered nanomotors	Self-propelled particles are tiny machines that generate a motor force from converting locally a source of energy into directed motion. The basic phenomenon of self-propulsion has been investigated via both experiments and computational models, with a distinctive inventiveness from experimentalists in terms of motor geometries and propulsion mechanisms. We use dedicated Molecular Dynamics simulations, in which the chemical activity, thermal fluctuations, and hydrodynamics are embedded, to present a modeling strategy that is amenable to reproduce any geometry and catalytic patches for chemically powered nanomotors. We apply this method to the spherical Janus particle then to the L-shape nanomotor, showing for the first time computer simulations of circling motion as an emergent feature of the coupled solvent-colloid system.
663	Influence of anisotropic Si(111)-(4x1)-In surface on growth of nanoscale In islands	Reflectance Anisotropy Spectroscopy (RAS) and Scanning Tunneling Microspcopy (STM) are used to study the growth of In on the anisotropic Si(111)&#x2212;In(4&#x00D7;1) surface at room temperature. RAS shows that epitaxial growth of In is accompanied by the disappearance of the surface optical anisotropy at 1.9 eV which is the fingerprint for the (4x1)-In surface reconstruction and the appearance of a large minimum at 1.4 eV which is at the same energy as interband transitions observed on bulk crystalline In. Subsequent spectra taken on the surface show that this minimum decreases and eventually disappears along with the reappearance of the original RAS signature of the (4x1)-In surface. STM of this surface shows elongated, anisotropic Indium crystal islands on top of a (4x1)-In reconstructed surface. The shape of the islands is due to anisotropy in diffusion driven growth, from the underlying anisotropic (4x1) reconstruction. Upon annealing the surface to 670 K, RAS of this surface shows a large positive anisotropy at about 1.5 eV with STM showing regions covered with a phase that resembles the (&#x221A;7x&#x221A;3)-In reconstruction. The epitaxial Indium islands now show a tetragonal shape, unlike on the (4x1) surface structure. Thus the growth morphology of the islands is shown to be dependent on the initial surface reconstruction. We attribute these findings to Ostwald ripening of the Indium islands mediated by In diffusion which is dependent on the structurally different In wetting layers on the Si substrate.
664	Core-Shell Super-Structures via Smart Deposition of Naphthothiadiazole and Benzodithiophene-Possessing Polymer Backbones onto Carbon Nanotubes and Photovoltaic Applications Thereof	Core-shell super-structures were developed via &#x03C0;-stacking of poly[benzodithiophene-bis(decyltetradecyl-thien) naphthothiadiazole] (PBDT-DTNT) and poly[bis(triiso-propylsilylethynyl) benzodithiophene-bis(decyltetradecyl-thien) naphthobisthiadiazole] (PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT) as conductive shells onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Structure of conjugated polymers substantially determines their deposition model onto CNTs. Regioregular poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) chains with hexyl side chains developed  delicate nanofibrils with a base attached to CNT surface. However, PBDT-DTNT and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT complicated conductive polymers with fused and infused thiophenic and benzenic rings preferred to be &#x03C0;-stacked with a face-on manner onto CNT surface and fabricate shells. Grafting of CNT surface with a polythiophene such as poly(3-dodecyl thiophene) (PDDT) introduced some defects onto the shell structure; because PBDT-DTNT and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT polymers were not able to be &#x03C0;-deposited onto CNT surface grafted with PDDT. The PDDT grafts were considered as hindrances against the stacking of complicated polymers. The thickness of PBDT-DTNT and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT shells ranged in 10&#xF02D;12 and 5&#xF02D;8 nm, respectively. Higher hindrance of TIPS side structures in PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT chains reflected thinner shells. By developing core-shells based on PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT and PBDT-DTNT, the conductivity reached 10.11 and 12.15 S/cm, respectively. Donor-acceptor core-shell nano-hybrids were then applied in active layer of photovoltaics. Efficiencies for CNT (core)-PBDT-DTNT (shell) and CNT (core)-PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT (shell) were 4.07 and 2.34%, respectively.
665	Dynamic and Photonic Phenomena in GaN/Si Nanowire Ensemble	Optical phenomena in high-quality GaN nanowires (NWs) ensemble grown on Si substrate have been studied by reflectance and time-resolved luminescence. Such nanowires form a structure that acts as a virtual layer that specifically reflects and polarizes light and can be characterized by an effective refractive index. In fact we have found that the NW ensembles of high NW density (high filling fraction) behave rather like a layer of effective medium described by Maxwell Garnett approximation. Moreover, light extinction and strong depolarization are observed that we assign to scattering and interference of light inside the NW ensemble. The wavelength range of high extinction and depolarization correlates well with transverse localization wavelength estimated for such ensemble of NWs, so we suppose that these effects are due to Anderson localization of light.<br />We also report results of time-resolved measurements of polarization of individual emission centers including free and bound excitons (D<sup>0</sup>X<sub>A</sub> , 3.47 eV), inversion domain boundaries (IDB, 3.45eV) and stacking faults (SF, 3.42 eV). The emission of the D<sup>0</sup>X<sub>A</sub> and SF lines is polarized perpendicular to GaN c-axis while the 3.45 eV line is polarized along the c-axis what supports hypothesis that this line is emitted from IDBs. Time-dependent depolarization of luminescence is observed during the first 0.1 ns after excitation and is interpreted as the result of interaction of the emission centers with hot particles existing during short time after excitation.
666	Persistent Photoconductivity Without Photoconductivity in Nanocrystalline Germanium/Amorphous Silicon Composite Thin Films	A light-induced increase in the dark conductivity is observed in composite thin films consisting of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) containing nanocrystalline germanium (nc-Ge) inclusions, synthesized by co-deposition in a dual-chamber plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition system. Unlike the Staebler-Wronski effect or persistent photoconductivity observed in amorphous semiconductors, the composite nc-Ge/a-Si:H films exhibiting this photo-induced excess conductivity have a minimal photosensitivity. The decay of the excess conductivity follows a simple exponential time dependence, with a temperature independent time constant, suggesting that tunneling through the germanium nanocrystalline inclusions is involved in the removal of this effect.
667	Optimum Conditions for Ultra-Low Power Light Emission via Avalanche Breakdown in Suspended Carbon Nanotubes	We explore near infrared light emission in suspended carbon nanotube field effect transistors (FETs) over a wide range of gate and bias voltages. In particular, we study the minimum bias voltage required to reach the light detection limit of our experimental setup as a function of the applied gate voltage. Here, we find that there is a relatively small region over which low power (~nW) avalanche emission is observed. By plotting the relative luminescence efficiency (i.e., light intensity/electrical power) as a function of the gate and bias voltages, we observe a very sharp feature over which the electroluminescence efficiency is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher that under all other conditions corresponding to avalanche emission. A steep increase in current with bias voltage (i.e., large dI/dVb), which signifies the onset of the avalanche process, is observed at the same gate and bias conditions of the highly efficient electroluminescence. We believe that these results demonstrate new mechanistic evidence for achieving highly efficient light emission in carbon nanotubes via avalanche breakdown.
668	Laser-induced electron emission from Au nanowires: a probe for longitudinal polarization	Photoelectron field emission, induced by femtosecond laser pulses focused on metallic nanotips, provides spatially coherent and temporally short electron pulses. <br />Properties of the photoelectron yield give insight into both the material properties of the nanostructure and the exciting laser focus.<br />Ultralong nanoribbons, grown as a single crystal attached to a metallic taper, are novel sources of electron field emission.<br />In this report, photoemission from gold nanoribbon samples is studied and compared to emission from tungsten and gold tips. <br />We observe that the emission from sharp tips generally depends on one transverse component of the exciting laser field, while the emission of a blunted nanoribbon is found to be sensitive to<br />both components. <br />We propose this property makes photoemission from nanoribbons a candidate for a novel position-sensitive detector for longitudinal field components in a tightly focused beam.
669	Guided ionization waves: the physics of repeatability	Guided ionization waves, or plasma streamers are increasingly important for many applications spanning materials processing and biomedicine. The highly-reproducible, repeatable behavior of the most puzzling kind of the streamers - plasma bullets is highly attractive as it promises a high degree of control in many applications. However, despite a dozen years since the discovery of this phenomenon, the exact reasons for such behavior still remain essentially unclear. To understand the dynamics of the guided ionization wave (plasma bullet), a large number of works has been carried out and many interesting results have been reported. Here we critically examine the available results, and generalize the physical mechanisms of the guided ionization waves, which are of particular interest to practical applications of atmospheric-pressure plasma discharges in general. The critical examination of the fundamental principles will show that, in order to propagate in a repeatable-mode, the plasma bullet must propagate in a channel with a high seed electron density (HSED), which is on the order of 109 cm-3. This review concludes that to distinguish guided ionization waves from traditional positive streamer discharges, it is most appropriate to describe an atmospheric-pressure discharge featuring a plasma bullet behavior as an HSED discharge. When the HSED condition is met, the dynamics of a plasma plume appears to be repeatable. On the country, it propagates in an unrepeatable mode and emerges more like a positive streamer discharge when the HSED condition is not satisfied. According to this theory, the transition of the propagation mode of the plasma bullet between the repeatable mode and the stochastic mode can be well explained. Besides, by controlling the seed electron density around the transition region between the HSED discharge and the traditional positive streamer, this knowledge will help better understanding of the positive streamer discharges in air, in cases relevant to practical applications of such plasma discharges in materials processing technologies, industrial chemistry, nanotechnology and health care.
670	Numerical simulation of magnetohydrodynamic  Jeffrey nanofluid flow and heat transfer over a stretching  sheet  considering Joule heating and viscous dissipation	The purpose of  the present study is to examine numerically the impact  of silver, titanium oxide and alumina nanoparticles on the steady 2D magnetohydrodynamic boundary layer  flow  and heat  transfer  of Jeffrey fluid  over a  stretching sheet  with Joule heating and viscous dissipation. The governing non-linear  partial differential  equations (PDEs) are reduced to the non-linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by using  appropriate dimensionless variables and then solved numerically by using Keller-box technique. The impacts of nanoparticle volume fraction,  magnetic parameter, Deborah number,  Prandtl number and Eckert number  on the velocity  and temperature profiles, local Nusselt number and skin friction drag coefficients are investigated with the assistance of graphs and tables. Results indicate that the  velocity, skin friction and local Nusselt number for the  silver-water nanofluid are comparatively less than those of the base fluid, however the temperature is enhanced through the inclusion of nanoparticles.  It is found  that both the skin friction and the Nusselt number increase by increasing the  Deborah number whereas they decrease by increasing the magnetic parameter.
671	<strong>Ultrathin amorphous ZnGe<sub>x</sub>SnO films for high performance ultra-thin-film transistors</strong>	Ultrathin amorphous ZnSnO (<em>a</em>-ZTO) films and ultrathin amorphous ZnGeSnO (<em>a</em>-ZGTO) films with various Ge contents were deposited by pulsed laser deposition for ultra-thin-film transistors (UTFTs). The thicknesses of the channel layers are approximately 3.2 nm. The properties of these ultrathin films and behaviors of these UTFTs were comparatively studied in detail. The <em>a</em>-ZTO ultrathin film exhibited a low concentration of oxygen vacancy (V<sub>O</sub>) compared to <em>a</em>-ZGTO ultrathin films. Among all the UTFTs, the <em>a</em>-ZTO UTFT demonstrated the undoubtedly best performance with an on/off current ratio of more than 10<sup>7</sup>, the largest filed-effect mobility of 23.2 cm<sup>2</sup>V<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, a positive threshold voltage of 2.0 V, a very small subthreshold swing of 0.31 V/decade and the best long-term stability under bias stress, suggesting the introduction of V<sub>O</sub> suppressors is dispensable with such a small thickness. Above all, the concentration of oxygen vacancy is easily controlled in the ultrathin <em>a</em>-ZTO nanofilms, leading to the UTFTs operating in the enhancement mode with high field-effect mobility of 23.2 cm<sup>2</sup>V<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> and excellent long-term stability. The <em>a</em>-ZTO ultrathin film and ultra-thin-film transistor are very potential for future electrical applications with their novel properties.
672	<strong>Energetic nanocomposites: Review on Metal based Nanothermites </strong>	A brief review on metal based nanothermites is presented in this paper for better understanding on exothermic behavior of nanoenergetic composites. Nanoenergetic composites are extensively young and interesting field in energetic materials because of their high reactivity and very low ignition temperatures. Metal based thermites have a huge range of applications theoretically which are yet to be approached practically. A better understanding in their characterization is required to continue the work; this paper presents the methods and parameters affecting the performance of nanoenergetic composites. Results of various studies on affecting parameters including particle size and passivation methods are also been presented and compared to give a clear understanding to the readers. A qualitative review has been reported here from synthesis of the composites to their initiation methods which help the researchers in further approach on nanothermites.
673	Explicit screening full band quantum transport model for semiconductor nanodevices	State of the art quantum transport models for semiconductor nanodevices attribute negative (positive) unit charges to states of the conduction (valence) band. Hybrid states that enable band-to-band tunneling are subject to interpolation that yield model dependent charge contributions. In any nanodevice structure, these models rely on device and physics specific input for the dielectric constants. This paper exemplifies the large variability of different charge interpretation models when applied to ultrathin body transistor performance predictions. To solve this modeling challenge, an electron-only band structure model is extended to atomistic quantum transport. Performance predictions of MOSFETs and tunneling FETs confirm the generality of the new model and its independence of additional screening models.
674	<strong>Formation of self-assembled lipid bilayer on CVD-grown MoS<sub>2</sub></strong>	Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been studied vigorously due to their outstanding mechanical, optical, and electrical properties. Among 2D materials, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently been spotlighted as the channel material of the field-effect transistor, which has been used for various applications. Many studies demonstrated applications in biological areas using MoS<sub>2</sub> as a TMD because of its sensitivity and stability. In this study, we built a fundamental bioelectronic platform with a lipid bilayer spread over large-area MoS<sub>2</sub> films via surface treatment. Firstly, we synthesized MoS<sub>2</sub> film on a sapphire substrate via a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. To form a stable lipid bilayer on the MoS<sub>2 </sub>film, the surface was treated with O<sub>2</sub> plasma, changing it from a hydrophobic to a hydrophilic surface. We performed surface characterization of the plasma-treated MoS<sub>2</sub> film with contact angle measurement and Raman spectroscopy. X-ray photoelectrons spectroscopy (XPS) characterizations were used for identification of the chemical states of elements before and after plasma surface modification. Moreover, we studied the physical properties of the lipid hybrid structure using fluorescence measurement and the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) test. Finally, we fabricated an electronic device with an MoS<sub>2</sub>-lipid bilayer hybrid structure and confirmed its sensing capability. Two-dimensional assembly of lipids and nanomaterials provides a platform for biosensing and bioelectronics applications.
675	Direct measurement of the optical shear angle of Nomarski prism beyond the diffraction limit	We propose and demonstrate a direct method to precisely characterize the Nomarski prism giving spatial resolution of the optical shear angle below 0.5 &mu;rad.  The method is demonstrated in a series of Nikon Nomarski prisms used as the key component of the differential interference contrast microscope module. With the application of the localization analysis at nanoscale, we accurately determine the central positions of highly overlapped intensity spots with orthogonal polarizations and we show that the achieved resolution of the shear angles of the measured prisms is beyond the diffraction limit.
676	Thermal effects on current-related skyrmion formation in a nanobelt	We report an <em>in-situ</em> Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) investigation to study the thermal effect on the generation of magnetic skyrmions within a nanobelt. Under an action of a moderate current pulse, magnetic skyrmions appear even at temperature range far below the critical temperature. Finite element simulation reveals that the Joule heating plays a key role in this behavior. Our results also uncovers the importance of the cooling conditions in the current-related <em>in situ</em> LTEM research.
677	Correlation of Structure with UV-visible Spectra by Varying SH Composition in Au-SH Nanoclusters	Structure and optoelectronic properties of thio protected Au (Au$_n$SR$_m$) nanoclusters are very important due to their extensive applications in various fields. To avoid the extensive computations, we model the artificial neural network (ANN) potentials for Au$_n$SR$_m$ nanoclusters in the range of $n$ = 10  to $n$ = 38 with accuracy of DFT. The modelled ANN potential is utilised to run extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The accuracy of ANN potential is tested by comparing global minimum (GM) structures of Au$_n$SR$_m$ nanoclusters at saturated amount of SH (experimentally and theoretically reported) composition. The GM structures are reported for the first time at lower SH compositions. We have studied the fluxional behaviour of Au$_n$SR$_m$ nanoclusters based on the probability study at 400 K by varying SH composition. The probability study indicates that Au$_n$SR$_m$ nanoclusters shows fluxional behaviour at lower SH compositions and hence their properties can be represented by ensemble of low-lying structures. Further, we correlate the structures of Au$_n$SR$_m$ nanoclusters with UV-visible spectra based on TDDFT calculations. The UV-visible spectral analysis revealed that significant spectroscopic features are observed at different SH compositions. This study provides the fundamental understanding of structural morphological changes and trends in optoelectronic properties with decreasing SH compositions and with increasing size of nanocluster.
678	Model of dielectric breakdown in hafnia-based ferroelectric capacitors	Ultra-thin ferroelectric hafnia-based thin film is a very promising candidate for nanoscale ferroelectric random access memories, but dielectric breakdown has been a main failure mechanism during repeated polarization switching. We generalized Lou <em>et al.</em>&rsquo;s local phase decomposition model, originally for ferroelectric fatigue, and proposed a dielectric breakdown model for ferroelectric hafnia. Charge injection during the polarization reversal is regarded as a key step, while the eventual phase separation of Hf cluster accounts for the dielectric breakdown. Using this model, we explained why TaN/HfO<sub>2</sub>/TaN ferroelectric capacitor is more prone to dielectric breakdown than TiN/HfO<sub>2</sub>/TiN, and concluded that the lower Schottky barrier for the TaN/<em>Pca</em>2<sub>1</sub>-HfO<sub>2</sub> interface stabilizes the neutral oxygen vacancies within the dielectric. On the other hand, with TiN electrodes the oxygen vacancies tend to be positively charged, which can pin the domain walls to cause ferroelectric fatigue. The relation between conductive filament formation, dielectric breakdown, wake up and fatigue in ferroelectric HfO<sub>2</sub> are discussed within our model framework.
679	Seebeck coe;cient of AuGe thin films for thermoelectric applications inorganic nanoscale devices	We experimentally study the thermoelectric properties of an AuxGe1-x thin film alloy close to the metal-insulator transition. The thermoelectric characterization of the thin film alloy reveals a Seebeck coe;fficient comparable to that of Au thin film while preserving good thermal sensor electrical properties, revealing the interest to use it for thermoelectric applications in organic nanoscale devices where it can fulll the double role of in-situ local heater and high resolution thermometer.
680	<strong><em>Facile synthesis and Characterization of undoped, Mn doped and Nd co-doped CuO nanoparticles for optoelectronic and magnetic applications</em></strong>	Copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles were prepared by sol-gel method, doped with Manganese (Mn) and co-doped with Neodymium (Nd) elements. The properties of synthesized nanoparticles were examined by XRD, SEM/EDX, FT-IR, DR spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, Hall effect measurement using two probe method and vibrating sample magnetometry for magnetic studies. Structural studies using XRD indicate the presence of a monoclinic structure of CuO for all the prepared samples with no other impurity phases detected. The images from scanning electron microscope have revealed that the grains are clusters structure. FTIR results of prepared CuO nanostructures support the monoclinic structure of CuO as in the case of XRD result. Using Tauc relation, the optical band gap is found to be 1.77eV for undoped CuO nanostructures, and is decreased to1.73 eV for Mn and1.71eV for the Nd co-doping. This decrease in the optical band gap on doping may be attributed to the fact that the impurity band merges with the conduction band of CuO. Hall measurements reveal that the conductivity of the sample increases for the doping of Mn and Nd co-doping. The magnetic studies using VSM show that the prepared nanostructures are found to have a maximum value of saturation magnetization at 3 wt% for Mn, Nd co-doped CuO, (i.e.) 0.07 emu/g.
681	Wavevector and Polarization Resolved Analysis of Phonon Scattering from Embedded Nanoparticles	Embedded nanocrystals are capable of dramatically reducing the thermal conductivity of alloy semiconductors through increased phonon scattering, but many aspects of thermal wavelength phonon interactions with embedded nanoparticles remain understudied.  Here, the wavevector- and polarization-resolved capabilities of the Frequency Domain Perfectly Matched Layer (FDPML) computational technique are exploited to study several fundamentally important phonon scattering problems across the entire Brillouin zone.  We compare the atomistic predictions of FDPML against continuum mechanics approaches for spherically embedded particles.  For long to mid wavelength phonons, reasonable agreement is found with continuum theories that consider the Mie regime accurately, while commonly used `patching' theories which empirically connect the Rayleigh scattering to the geometric limit are shown to have poor agreement with more rigorous approaches.  Next, the scattering cross section of optical phonons from nanoparticles is explored for the first time.  We show that scattering behavior of optical phonons is fundamentally different than their acoustic counterparts in that long wavelength optical phonons exhibit a scattering cross section nearly independent of wavelength, which we interpret as being due to zone folding of short wavelength acoustic modes from the geometric scattering regime into long wavelength optical modes. Finally, we study the scattering cross section of nanoparticles exhibiting atomic interdiffusion at the matrix-particle interface, where we find that interdiffusion both suppressed Mie oscillations and substantially increases the scattering cross section at short wavelength, compared to a solid nanoparticle with the same number of impurity atoms.
682	Ultrahigh refractive index sensitivity via lattice-induced meta-dipole modes in flat metallic nanoantenna arrays	We investigate control of plasmonic-photonic coupling in flat metallic nanoantenna arrays. We demonstrate that when the nanoantennas are packed together along their short axes (transverse lattice constant) and the incident light polarization is along their long axes, they can support lattice-induced plasmonic resonance coupled to a super-photonic mode that densely fills the superstrate. At a certain wavelength this resonance joins the plasmonic tip modes of the nanoantennas, forming meta-dipole modes. These modes have field profiles similar to those of the normal plasmonic dipole modes of individual nanoantennas but they occur at much shorter wavelengths and offer a very high bulk refractive index sensitivity (912 nm/RIU). We show that with increase of the transverse lattice constant such a sensitivity decreases as the meta-dipole modes disappear. Under this condition, the refractive index sensitivity supported by normal modes of the nanoantennas increases, as the plasmonic edge mode suppression caused by charge rearrangement decreases.
683	Effect of growth interruption in 1.55 &mu;m InAs/InAlGaAs quantum dots on InP grown by molecular beam epitaxy	<strong><strong>We report the effect of growth interruptions on the structural and optical properties of InAs/InAlGaAs/InP quantum dots using molecular beam epitaxy. Growth interruption after InAs quantum dot deposition red-shifted photoluminescence wavelength peak from 1.58 &mu;m to 1.78 &mu;m, while the morphology of the uncapped InAs quantum dots remained unchanged. We find that the surface quantum dots experience unintended ripening process during the sample cooling stage, and this reshaped the uncapped InAs nanostructures. Partial capping effectively inhibited structural reconfiguration of surface InAs nanostructures during cooling stage and revealed evolution of InAs/InAlGaAs quantum dashes to quantum dots as the growth interruption time increased. Transmission electron microscope studies confirmed the presence of quantum dashes in a sample without growth interruption while atomic force microscope measurements showed quantum dots on the surface.</strong></strong>
684	Dynamic multiple-scattering treatment of X-ray absorption: Parametrization of a new classical force field for Myoglobin	We present a detailed analysis of the XANES data on the Fe K-edge of CO Myoglobin based on a combined procedure of Molecular Dynamics (MD) calculations and MXAN data analysis that we call D-MXAN. The ability of performing quantitative XANES data analysis allows us to refine classical force field MD parameters, thus obtaining a reliable tool for the atomic investigation of this important model system for biological macromolecules. The iterative procedure here applied corrects the greatest part of the structural discrepancy between classical MD sampling and experimental determinations. Our procedure, moreover, is able to discriminate between different heme conformational basins visited during the MD simulation, thus demonstrating the necessity of a sampling in the order of tens of nanoseconds, even for applications such XAS data analysis.
685	Comprehensive Dependence of Triboelectric Nanogenerator on Dielectric Thickness and External Impact for High Electric Outputs	Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have aroused extensive interests in recent years, and their energy conversion efficiency increased gradually under massive efforts. Applied force and dielectric thickness are two important factors account for high output performance. Nevertheless, for the most commonly used TENGs in contact-separation mode, the comprehensive dependence of dielectric thickness and impact force are still expected to be further deeply researched and optimized. Hence, we fabricated a nylon-PTFE TENG (NP-TENG) in contact-separation mode and explored the dual influence of dielectric thickness and applied force on the output performance. Results indicate that the dielectric thickness and impact force have comprehensive influence on the outputs, which is due to the dual effect of charge transport properties and the deformation at different thicknesses. Mostly, the optimum thickness concentrates at 0.5 mm, and it increases under a gradually increase of impact force but stays steadily with varying of fabric count. With the continuous enlargement of impact force, the dielectric thickness reaches a boundary limitation of 0.8 mm. This work contributes greatly not only to the design and optimization of TENG devices, but also to the deeper understanding of the nano-triboelectric effect mechanism.
686	<strong>Fabrication of Single-Electron Transistors with Electromigrated Ni Nanogaps</strong>	We analyze single-electron transistors (SETs) fabricated with electromigrated Ni nanogaps using the Korotkov and Nazarov (KN) model. First, we investigate nanogap-based SETs consisting of multiple Ni islands placed between the source and drain electrodes by a field-emission induced electromigration technique known as &lsquo;activation.&rsquo; After the activation procedure is performed using a preset current <em>I</em><sub>s</sub> of 3 &mu;A, the drain current-drain voltage characteristics of SETs with single-island structures are obtained and analyzed by using the KN model and considering the offset charges on the islands. We determine the equivalent circuit parameters from the electrical properties of the SETs. The parameters can be explained using the geometrical structures of the SETs that are observed in both scanning electron and atomic force microscopy images after the activation procedure. This approach allows the electrical and structural properties of the single-island structures of the SETs fabricated using the activation method to be determined.
687	Spectroscopic Studies of Laser produced plasma of doped nano-structured material by Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy	We present the qualitative and quantitative use of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) for the compositional characterization of doped material of Zinc (Zn) & tin (Sn) nanoparticles. The transition metal Zinc doped tin nanoparticles were synthesized via co-precepitation and hydrothermal routes. A single laser operating at wavelengths around 532 nm is used to produce ablated plasma. The detailed analysis of emission spectrum of ablated plasma reveal qualitative information which can be correlated with identification of target material. The Boltzmann plot, standard two line and Saha-Boltzmann plot methods were used to determine the plasma temperature of nanoparticles while stark broadening method and  Saha-Boltzmann equation were used to estimate electron number density of ablated plasma. Calibration free (CF-LIBS), one line calibration free (OLCF) and Calibration curve  (CC-LIBS) approaches have been used  for quantitative analysis of doped nano-structured materials with low and high concentrations. In CF-LIBS and OLCF-LIBS, quantitative analysis of sample are carried out using Boltzmann plots & Saha Boltzman equations, respectively  while in calibration based LIBS , quantitative results based on calibration curves were obtained and limits of detection of nanoparticles were also determined using these calibration curves.  Quantitative results estimated from calibration free and Calibration based approaches were compared and validated with results from standard techniques such as Laser Ablation Time of fllight (LA-TOF) spectroscopy and EDX . The present work establishes LIBS as an effective analytical tool for qualitative and quantitative estimation of the doped nanomaterials from atomic emission spectra.
688	<strong>Simulation of Nanofluid Natural Convection in a U-Shaped Cavity Equipped by a Heating Obstacle: Effect of Cavity's Aspect Ratio</strong>	Research on nanofluid for heat transfer enhancement of thermal systems has received great attention owing to the lack of energy sources. In this study, fluid flow and natural convection heat transfer of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-Water or TiO<sub>2</sub>-water nanofluid inside a U-shaped cavity consist of a hot obstacle has been investigated numerically by lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). In this paper, different parameters are investigated such as Rayleigh number, the solid volume fraction of the nanoparticles, the U-shaped cavity's aspect ratio and heating obstacle's height on the flow field and heat transfer in the enclosure. The results showed that the Rayleigh number (Ra), cavity aspect ratio (AR) and obstacle's height can be affected on isotherms, streamlines and local and average Nusselt number. The average Nusselt number of the obstacle sides increased by increasing the <em>Ra</em> number and solid volume fraction of nanoparticles (&phi;) regardless the AR. In addition, by increasing the AR, the average Nusselt number increased. At low Ra, the effect of nanoparticles on enhancement of heat transfer for narrow cavities was more than that for wide ones.
689	<strong>Ultralight and Ultraelastic Sponge/Al@Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>Nanocomposite with Tunable Electromagnetic Properties</strong>	Electromagnetic absorption/shielding materials are highly desirable for high-rapidly developing microelectronic devices. However, it is still lack for a specific material with dynamic tunable properties to solve issues in complex environments. We herein report a hybrid composite consisting of three-dimensional porous melamine sponge and core@shell Al@Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles, possessing multiple merits of low density (12.47 mg/cm<sup>3</sup>) and high elasticity. By compressing/decompressing the hybrid, the electromagnetic performances can be reversibly tuned between 18-26.5 GHz, ascribed to the tunable conductivity raised from the three-dimensional continuous conductive paths. The present work provides a concept for the design of &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; electromagnetic materials.
690	Bending deformation behavior of Zr65Cu17.5Ni10Al7.5 bulk metallic glass with different solidification cooling rate	In order to further clarify the relationship between the free volume and bending plasticity, the bending properties of Zr65Cu17.5Ni10Al7.5 bulk metallic glass (BMG) samples with different thicknesses corresponding to different solidification cooling rates were investigated. The results show that the bending plasticity of Zr65Cu17.5Ni10Al7.5 BMG decreases with the decrease of cooling rate, which is consistent with the evolution of shear bands density revealed by the investigation of microstructure. These phenomena are mainly attributed to the decrease of free volume content with the decrease of cooling rates, although the increase of nanocrystallization fraction. These results further confirm that free volume plays an important role in the deformation process of the BMGs.
691	Control of thermal boundary resistance by increasing Ge ratio in nanocomposite with MnSi<sub>1.7</sub> and SiGe	Thermal boundary resistance (TBR) was controlled by changing the Ge ratio in MnSi<sub>1.7</sub>-based nanocomposite with SiGe to investigate effects of TBR on thermal transport. We demonstrated a continuous reduction of thermal conductivity with the Ge ratio down to 1.2 W/Km, which is less than the minimum thermal conductivity of MnSi<sub>1.7</sub>, even in granular structures: practical forms of thermoelectric (TE) technologies. The TBR between MnSi<sub>1.7</sub> and SiGe was estimated quantitatively in multilayered structures to be as high as 5.6&times;10<sup>-9</sup> m<sup>2</sup>K/W and detailed analysis suggests that 20-30% of the thermal conductivity reduction can be attributed to the TBR in granular structures. Our results shed light on the importance of controlling TBR in TE material design towards a widespread use of TE technologies, instead of utilizing rare materials or uneconomical nanostructures.
692	<strong>Ultrafast Time-Resolved Measurement of Energy Transport at the Metal-Liquid Interface</strong>	<strong>The light-matter interaction near metallic interfaces has many important applications in nanotechnology, especially when it comes to enhance the surface-to-volume ratio and to achieve high spatial energy confinement. The ultrafast time-resolved responses of photo-excited metallic structures have intensively studied using the transient transmittance spectroscopy (TAS). Here we report a new ultrafast time-resolved measurement to study photo-excited energy transport at the metal-liquid interfaces of colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). By using TAS together with the stimulated emission depletion (STED) of fluorescent molecules, we simultaneously measured the perturbations of energy states on both sides of the interfaces within a nanoscale distance. Our measurement results showed the evidence of ultrafast coupling between AuNPs and its surrounding solvent molecules at a picosecond timescale. </strong>
693	Three dimensional MHD Couple stress nanofluid flow over an exponentially stretching surface with convective heat and new mass flux condition	We have discussed the three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic flow of the couple stress nanofluid with joule heating and viscous dissipation effects past an exponentially stretched surface. The analysis is performed in the presence of Brownian motion and thermophoresis with the amalgamation of convective heat condition. Here, different from previous literature, recently introduced more realistic boundary condition for nanoparticle volume fraction model i.e., zero mass flux condition has also been introduced first time for 3D couple stress nanofluid model as far as the exponential stretched surface is concerned. By applying this condition on the boundary, active control of the nanoparticle volume fraction at the boundary is eliminated. Self-similar transformations are engaged to obtain a system of ordinary differential equations with high nonlinearity from the system of boundary layer partial differential equations. An analytic solution is constructed in the form of series via Homotopy Analysis method (HAM). Numerically calculated values of Skin friction and local Nusselt number are also given with appropriate discussion. Moreover, influences of sundry parameters on velocity distribution, heat, and mass transfer rate are deliberated and depicted through graphs. Based on the obtained results, it is seen that Biot number and Hartmann number possess similar effect on temperature distribution. To authenticate our obtained results, a comparison in limiting case is also given.
694	Gold Nanoparticles Passivated with Functionalized Alkylthiols: Simulations of Solvation in the Infinite Dilution Limit	Solvation of gold nanoparticles passivated with end group functionalized alkylthiols, namely CH<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>2</sub> or COOH is studied in solvents of varying degrees of repulsion-dispersion and electrostatic interactions ranging from strongly polar SPC/E water to modified hybrid water models, where the Lennard-Jones contribution to the potentialsenergy is enhanced relative to SPC/E to completely non-polar, decane. The effects due to solvent reorganization around the nanoparticle as a function of the ligand and solvent chemistry are monitored using the nanoparticle-solvent pair correlation functions and tetrahedral order parameter. The solvent penetration inside the ligand shell is maximum for decane, indicating better solute-solvent interaction in decane compared to other solvents. The COOH end group functionalized nanoparticle breaks the tetrahedral structure of water molecules more as compared to other nanoparticles used in this study. The ligand reorganization and its effect on solvation are monitored using radial density profiles (RDPs), radius of gyration (R<sub>g</sub>) and ligand asymmetry parameter (&#x0394;). RDP and R<sub>g</sub> values show significant stretching of ligands in decane than in model waters, which is also consistent with &#x0394;. The ligand shell anisotropy for all nanoparticles is maximum in SPC/E water and minimum in decane. The isotropic potential of mean force (VPMF (r)) between two identical end group functionalized nanoparticles have been calculated in vacuum, SPC/E water and H3.00 modified hybrid water, which consistently shows attractive well depth.sDistance-dependent fluctuation driven anisotropy has also been examined. The implications for self-assembly of passivated gold nanoparticles from aqueous dispersions as well as the dependence of calculated quantities on ligand and solvent chemistry are highlighted.
695	Spectral Quasi-Linearization for analysis of Non-Newtonian nanofluid flow over a horizontal surface imbeddedin a non-Darcy porous medium with convective boundary condition	The boundary layer nanofluid flow over a horizontal plate imbedded<br />in a non-Darcy porous medium is investigated in this study.<br />Non-Newtonian power-law fluid is considered as the base fluid. The<br />nanofluid model incorporated the effects of Brownian motion and<br />thermophoresis. A mixed convective boundary condition which is more<br />useful in practise, is employed at the surface instead of Dirichlet<br />or Neumann boundary conditions. The flow and convective heat<br />transfer has engineering and industrial applications such as the<br />thermal design of industrial equipment dealing with molten plastics<br />and polymeric liquids; and applications in nuclear plants and<br />thermal energy storage processes. The main aim of this study is to<br />use the spectral quasi-linearization method to study the effects of<br />non-Newtonian nanofluid flow over a horizontal surface for porous<br />medium. The objective is to explore both the accuracy and the<br />convergence of the method through the evaluation of residual errors<br />and error norms and to investigate the impact of specific parameters<br />on the flow behavior and heat transfer characteristics.
696	<strong>Standard and Inverse Microscale Chladni Figures in Liquid</strong>	<strong>We report on the first experimental demonstrations of standard and inverse Chladni figures at <em>sub-100&micro;m scale</em> in both one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) fashions in liquid.  Silica microbeads (1&ndash;8&micro;m in diameter) dispersed on top of resonating doubly-clamped beams (100&times;10&times;0.4&micro;m<sup>3</sup>) are observed to aggregate at <em>antinodal</em> points, forming 1D <em>inverse</em> Chladni figures, while microbeads atop square trampoline resonators (50&times;50&times;0.2&micro;m<sup>3</sup>) cluster at <em>nodal</em> lines/circles, creating 2D <em>standard</em> Chladni figures, such as </strong><strong>&lsquo;+</strong><strong>&rsquo;, &lsquo;o&rsquo;, &lsquo;&times;&rsquo;, &lsquo;\&rsquo;, </strong><strong>manifesting the multimode resonances.</strong><strong>  These observations suggest two distinct Micro-Chladni figure patterning mechanisms in liquid.  Combining analytical and computational modeling, we elucidate that streaming flow dominates the <em>inverse</em> Chladni pattern formation in the 1D beam experiments, while the vibrational acceleration dictates the <em>standard</em> Chladni figure generation in the 2D trampoline experiments.  We further demonstrate dynamical patterning, switching, and removal of 2D micro-Chladni figures in rapid succession by simply controlling the excitation frequency.  Our results render better understandings of Chladni patterning at the microscale, and may facilitate fast, non-invasive and versatile manipulation and patterning of micro/nanoscale biological objects (<em>e.g.</em>, cells), toward relevant biosensing and biophysical applications.  </strong>
697	Thermoelectric properties of graphene nanoribbons with roughness surface	By means of nonequilibrium Green&rsquo;s function method, we theoretically investigate the ballistic thermoelectric performance of graphene nanoribbons with roughness surface. The results show that the roughness surface could dramatically reduce the thermal conductance of graphene nanoribbons, and thus leading to the boosting of thermoelectric performance of graphene (the figure of merit can be as high as 3.7 at room temperature). Meanwhile, the electron transport properties of different edged rough graphene nanoribbons exhibit distinctive anisotropic behaviors, i.e., the thermal power of armchair edged is significantly increased while that of zigzag edged is nearly unchanged, which is mainly contributed to the edge effect. The findings presented in this paper qualify roughness surface as an efficient approach to enhance the thermoelectric performance of graphene nanoribbons.
698	<strong>Hybrid Photo-Magnetic Modulation of Magnetite/Gold Nanoparticle Deposited Dextran Covered Carbon Nanotubes for Hyperthermia Applications</strong>	The hybrid photo-magnetic (PMA) stimulation effect was characterized on magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) and gold (Au) nanoparticle (NP) decorated dextran covered carbon nanotube (CNT) structures (DIGCNTs). The observed PMA response was stronger compared to the stand-alone magnetic and photo-thermal effects; additionally the hybrid irradiation produced a temperature elevation of &gt;20&ordm;C at a DIGCNT concentration of only 50<em>&micro;</em>g/mL. The designed nano-structures did not launch any apoptotic machinery of the neural cell model up to a concentration of 200<em>&micro;g</em>/mL; however severely affected the viability of tumor suppressor protein p53 deficient NE-4C cells in culture when activated by the PMA stimulation at a concentration as low as 50<em>&micro;g</em>/mL. The intensity of this hybrid irradiation inducing significant cell apoptosis by hyperthermic ablation, but not through the innate toxicity of the nanostructures was found to be significantly less than the reported values for magnetic, optical, or radiofrequency (RF) field activation for similar applications thus far. Acute toxicity of this unique hybrid actuation-hybrid material combination, coupled with excellent base level biocompatibility, may be extremely relevant to the development of <em>in-vivo</em> PMA hyperthermia.
699	Comparison of ZnO Surface Modification with Gas-Phase Propiolic Acid at High and Medium Vacuum Conditions	Recent advances in preservation of the morphology of ZnO nanostructures during dye sensitization required the use of a two-step preparation procedure. The first step was the key for preserving ZnO materials morphology. It required exposing clean ZnO nanostructures to a gas-phase prop-2-ynoic acid (propiolic acid) acid in vacuum. This step resulted in the formation of a robust and stable surface-bound carboxylate with ethynyl groups available for further modification, for example, with click chemistry. This paper utilizes spectroscopic and microscopic investigations to answer several questions about this modification and to determine if the process can be performed under medium vacuum conditions instead of high vacuum procedures reported earlier. Comparing the results of the preparation process at medium vacuum of 0.5 Torr base pressure with the previously reported investigations of the same process in high vacuum of 10-5 Torr suggests that both processes lead to the formation of the same surface species, confirming that the proposed modification scheme can be widely applicable for ZnO sensitization procedures and does not require the use of high vacuum. Additional analysis comparing the computationally predicted surface structures with the results of spectroscopic investigations yields the more complete description of the surface species resulting from this approach.
700	<strong>Rheology Modulated Enhancement in Electrochemomechanical Energy Conversion in Soft Nanofluidic Channels</strong>	In this article, we devise a mathematical model to examine the effect of fluid rheology of viscoelastic fluids on the generation of streaming potential in a nano fluidic channel, whose walls are grafted with ion-penetrable and solvent-permeable polyelectrolyte layer (PEL) of thickness . For describing the rheology of the viscoelastic fluids, we use the simplified Phan-Thien-Tanner (sPTT) model. By invoking a few approximations in the present calculations, we obtain the velocity expressions for all sPTT models and well ahead, we report the plausible amendments in the enhancement of streaming potential, electroviscous effect and Electrochemomechanical efficiency with the changes in Debye-Huckel parameter of the electrolyte , drag constant of PEL , applied pressure gradient  and PEL thickness . The shear-dependent extra normal stresses  of the viscoelastic fluids enhances the convection of the counter-ions and generate comparatively high amount of streaming potential in the soft nanochannel, leading to more energy conversion than that obtained from the Newtonian fluid. Finally, we show that, for a given set of other parameters remaining same, the viscoelasticity of the fluid gives rise to an enhancement of 2% to 15% in the electrochemomechanical efficiency over the transport of Newtonian fluid.
701	Preparation and measurement of subwavelength bilayer metal wire grid polarizers on flexible plastic substrate	This study demonstrates fabrication of subwavelength bilayer metal wire grid polarizers and characterizes their performance. Polarizers with 278 nm period were fabricated on flexible plastic substrates by nanoimprint lithography followed by aluminum deposition. Transmission efficiency exceeding 0.55 and an extinction ratio exceeding 32 dB were achieved in the visible range when polarizer aluminum thickness is 70 nm. Using a polarization analyzer with a 6-channel sensor prototype, average error was obtained at 0.2002{degree sign}, with a maximum of 1.105{degree sign} and standard deviation of 0.7255{degree sign}. The proposed fabrication method will be suitable for many optics applications, including compound eye structure manufacture.
702	Role of Stone-Wales Defects on the Interfacial Interactions among Graphene, Carbon Nanotube, and Nylon 6: A First-Principles Study	We present results of our computational investigation on effect of Stone-Wales (SW) defect on interfacial interactions among graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and Nylon 6. Our calculations were carried out using both first-principles density functional pseudopotential method, and empirical force-field. Both pristine and SW-defected carbon nanomaterials were examined in our investigation. The computed results show that the presence of SW-defects in CNTs weakens the CNT-graphene interactions. Our results that CNT-graphene interaction is much stronger than CNT-CNT interaction- indicate that graphene would be able to promote the dispersion of CNTs in the polymer matrix. Our results demonstrate that carbon nanomaterials form stable complexes with Nylon 6, and that the van der Waals interactions, as revealed by the electron density difference maps, play a key stabilizing role in the interactions between CNTs and graphene, and also between carbon nanomaterials and Nylon 6. Using density of states calculations, we observed that the band gaps of CNT and graphene were not significantly modified due to their interactions with Nylon 6.
703	Fabrication and evaluation of controllable deposition distance for aligned pattern by multi-nozzle near-field electrospinning	To mass-volume fabricate micro- and nano-scales aligned pattern, multi-nozzle near-field electrospinning (NFES) direct-writing technology is well proposed as a high-efficiency method in electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing process. However, the interference effect among adjacent nozzles and coupling effect of various parameters have restricted to investigate deposition characteristic of multi-nozzle NFES and control EHD multi-jet deposition accuracy. In order to improve the accuracy of EHD multi-jet deposition with high-efficiency printing process, the experimental result compared with theoretical method were discussed. In this work, the influence of multi-nozzle geometry distribution and electrospinning parameters on deposition characteristic was studied with multi-nozzle NFES setup, and nozzles were in linear array. The deposition distance and homogeneity of aligned nanofibers were measured and explained with coefficient of dispersion on electric field among nozzles by simulation. Moreover, deposition distance of multi-nozzle NFES process was evaluated by modified theoretical derivation based on our previous studies. The modified theoretical derivation showed a good agreement with experiment results, and indicated that multi-nozzle NFES could accurately and efficiently direct-write aligned array pattern in future.
704	<strong>Ultrafast scanning electron microscope applied for studying the interaction between free electrons and optical near-fields of periodic nanostructures</strong>	In this paper we describe an ultrafast scanning electron microscope setup developed for the research of inelastic scattering of electrons at optical near-fields of periodic dielectric nanostructures. Electron emission from the Schottky cathode is controlled by ultraviolet femtosecond laser pulses. The electron pulse duration at the interaction site is characterized via cross-correlation of the electrons with an infrared laser pulse that excites a synchronous periodic near-field on the surface of a silicon nanostructure. The lower limit of 410 fs is found in the regime of a single electron per pulse. The role of pulse broadening due to Coulomb interaction in multielectron pulses is investigated. The setup is used to demonstrate an increase of the interaction distance between the electrons and the optical near-fields by introducing a pulse-front-tilt to the infrared laser beam. Further we show the dependence of the final electron spectra on the resonance condition between the phase velocity of the optical near-field and the electron propagation velocity. The resonance is controlled by adjusting the initial electron energy/velocity and by introducing a linear chirp to the structure period allowing to increase the final electron energy gain up to a demonstrated 3.8 keV.
705	<strong>Broadband photodetectors based on electron-ion conductor composite nanostructures graphene/RbAg<sub>4</sub>I<sub>5</sub>: response characteristics and mechanisms</strong>	We have developed an electron-ion conductor using a composite nanostructure based on monolayer graphene and a RbAg<sub>4</sub>I<sub>5</sub> film (gr/RbAg<sub>4</sub>I<sub>5</sub>) that exhibited desirable photoelectric properties when illuminated with short wavelength light. The photoelectric response of gr/RbAg<sub>4</sub>I<sub>5</sub> was primarily caused by dissociation and recombination of ion-electron bound states (IEBS). Moreover, ultraviolet-induced photodesorption was also found to participate in the photoelectric response. Combined with our previous work, a complete theoretical model combing both the photodesorption effect and the dynamics of IEBS yielded excellent agreement with the photocurrent-power curves at all wavelengths that were measured. These studies are a significant step towards realizing broadband photodetectors containing the gr/RbAg<sub>4</sub>I<sub>5</sub> composite nanostructures.
706	<strong>Multi-Peak Negative Differential Resistance in Silicene Superlattice: Toward Multi-Valued Silicene Logic Devices</strong>	Negative diffrential resistance (NDR) in two dimansional materials have been the subject of strong interest for ultra-low power nanoelectronic applications. Here, we report NDR characterstics of silicene superlattice (SSL) at low bias voltages. Tansport process manipulated by miniband regime for low bias region and Wannier-Stark ladder (WSLs) regime with multi-peak NDR for higher bias windows. Local tunneling peaks rise from hybridization of Wannier-Stark (WS) rungs in certain bias voltages. Bias position of WS states crossings down shifted with increasing device dimansion leading to red shifted NDR window and increase peak to valley ratio (PVR) values. The multiple NDR windows are represented by changing the size and the number of well/barriers in SSL. Maximum PVR of 8 obtained for device with low height barriers. Multi-peak NDR with same PVR values in very low bias regime can find key applications in multi-valued memories with low static power dissipation.
707	<strong>Formation of some Au-based nanoalloys in condensation-coalescence process: A thermodynamic and structural MD investigation</strong>	In this research, we have investigated surface energy and relative stability of some Au-based clusters formed during gas-phase condensation using MD simulation. Trend of relative stability (the &Delta; parameter) of the formed clusters obeys the order: &Delta;<sub> Au-Pt</sub>&lt; &Delta;<sub> Au-Rh</sub>&lt; &Delta;<sub> Au-Cu</sub>&lt; &Delta;<sub> Au-Ag</sub>&lt; &Delta;<sub> Au-Pd</sub> . The results showed that the Au atoms tend to lie at the clusters surface whereas the other atoms lie at the cluster cores. In the Au-Ag nanocluster, the Au atoms tend to lie at the cluster cores. It is also shown at the following order of the surface energy exists at all simulation times: E<sub>S (Au-Pt)</sub>&lt; E<sub>S (Au-Rh)</sub>&lt; E<sub>S (Au-Ag)</sub>&lt; (E<sub>S (Au-Pd)</sub> , E<sub>S (Au-Cu)</sub>) which is in good agreement with the stability trend of the formed nanoclusters (with the exception of the Au-Cu cluster). Surprisingly, it is observed that the formed Au-Rh and Au-Pt had negative values of the surface energy which is in agreement with the &#x2206; parameter results and is due to the much stability of the formed Au<sub>0.5</sub>Rh<sub>0.5</sub> and Au<sub>0.5</sub>Pt<sub>0.5</sub> nanoclusters during the gas-phase condensation process. Our results also indicated some ordered structures such as fcc-like or hcp-like structures within the Au-Rh, Au-Pt, and Au-Ag clusters.
708	<strong>Probing the pathway of an ultrafast structural phase transition to illuminate the transition mechanism in Cu<sub>2</sub>S</strong>	Disentangling the primary order parameter from secondary order parameters in phase transitions is critical to the interpretation of the transition mechanisms in strongly correlated systems and quantum materials. Here we present a study of structural phase transition pathways in superionic Cu<sub>2</sub>S nanocrystals that exhibit intriguing properties. Utilizing ultrafast electron diffraction techniques sensitive in both momentum-space and the time-domain, we distinguish the dynamics of crystal symmetry breaking and lattice expansion in this system. We are able to follow the transient states along the transition pathway and so observe the dynamics of both the primary and secondary order parameters. Based on these observations we argue that the mechanism of the structural phase transition in Cu<sub>2</sub>S is dominated by the electron-phonon coupling. This mechanism advances the understanding from previous results where the focus was solely on dynamic observations of the lattice expansion.
709	Phase transformation stresses and fracture toughness in Ti-Al-N	The formation of hcp (ZnS-wurtzite type) AlN precipitates, due to decomposition of supersaturated fcc (NaCl-type) Ti-Al-N coatings, causes the residual macrostresses to increase from -3.9{plus minus}0.3 GPa (as-deposited) to -5.2{plus minus}0.3 GPa (annealed at 900 {degree sign}C), as determined by X-ray diffraction. This leads to an increase in measured fracture toughness (KIC) - obtained by cube corner nanoindenation experiments - from the as-deposited value of ~4.4 MPa&#x221A;m to ~8.0 MPa&#x221A;m when annealed at 900 {degree sign}C. This assessment is supported by studying the phase transformation induced stresses by continuum mechanics modelling using Transformation Field Analysis.
710	<strong>Reconfigurable magnetic and microwave properties of a ferrimagnetic-type artificial crystal</strong>	We have demonstrated a ferrimagnetic-type anti-parallel remanent state of rhomboid shaped nanomagnets of two different widths alternated in a dipolar coupled nanomagnetic array. Anti-parallel state is reconfigured to a parallel remanent state by using a simple field initialization process. Magnetic states were directly visualized using magnetic force microscopy technique. Due to a variation of the stray field distributions for the two different remanent states, distinct dynamic responses are found using broadband ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy technique without applying any external bias magnetic field. Experimental observations were supported by the micromagnetic simulations. The results are important in the context of bias-field-free and reprogrammable microwave magnetic devices and creation of artificial ferrimagnetic crystal.
711	<strong>Convective flows of generalized time-nonlocal nanofluids </strong><strong>through a vertical rectangular channel</strong>	Time-nonlocal generalized model of natural convection heat transfer and nanofluid flows through a rectangular vertical channel with wall conditions of Robin type are studied. The generalized mathematical model with time-nonlocality is developed by considering the fractional constitutive equations for the shear stress and thermal flux defined with the time-fractional Caputo derivative. The Caputo power-law non-local kernel provides the damping to the velocity and temperature gradient, therefore, transport processes are influenced by the histories at all past and present times.s<p>Analytical solutions for dimensionless velocity and temperature fields are obtained by using the Laplace transform coupled with the finite sine-cosine Fourier transform which is suitable to problems with boundary conditions of Robin type.</p>s<p>Particularizing the fractional thermal and velocity parameters, solutions for three simplified models are obtained (classical linear momentum equation with damped thermal flux; fractional shear stress constitutive equation with classical Fourier&rsquo;s law for thermal flux; classical shear stress and thermal flux constitutive equations).</p>s<p>It is found that the thermal histories strongly influence the thermal transport for small values of time t. Also, the thermal transport can be enhanced if the thermal fractional parameter decreases or by increasing the nanoparticles volume fraction. Velocity field is influenced on the one hand by the temperature of the fluid and on the other by the damping of the velocity gradient introduced by the fractional derivative. Also, the transport motions of the channel walls influence the motion of the fluid layers located near them.
712	On the resolution of subsurface atomic force microscopy and its implications for subsurface feature sizing	Ultrasound atomic force microscopy (AFM) has received considerable interest due to its subsurface imaging capabilities, particularly for nanostructure imaging. The local contact stiffness variation due to the presence of a subsurface feature is the origin of the imaging contrast. Several research studies have demonstrated subsurface imaging capabilities with promising resolution. However, there is limited literature available about the definition of spatial resolution in subsurface AFM. The changes in contact stiffness and their link to the subsurface resolution are not well understood. We propose a quantitative approach to assess the resolution in subsurface AFM imaging. We have investigated the influences of several parameters of interest on the lateral resolution. The quantification of the subsurface feature size can be based on threshold criteria (full width at half maximum and Rayleigh criteria). Simulations and experimental measurements were compared, revealing that the optimal choice of parameter settings for surface topography AFM is suboptimal for subsurface AFM imaging.
713	Instability of insulator state towards nanocrystallinity in (La<sub>0.5</sub>Y<sub>0.5</sub>)<sub>0.7</sub>Ca<sub>0.3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> compound: Enhancement of low field magnetoresistance	The present study shows the modification of the insulator state to metallic state with reduction of particle size in (La<sub>0.5</sub>Y<sub>0.5</sub>)<sub>0.7</sub>Ca<sub>0.3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> compound by magnetotransport measurements. The decrease in the activation energy, as well as increase in the effective density of states near Fermi level, is observed with particle size reduction. This modification leads to the decrease in the<br />resistivity in the nanoparticle in the low-temperature regime (T &lt; 150K). On the other hand, the temperature dependent dc susceptibility data shows the evolution of the non-Griffiths phase to Griffiths phase with reduction of particle size in the temperature range 100K &lt; T &#x0014; 200K. This evolution from non-Griffiths phase to Griffiths phase leads to the formation of large ferromagnetic<br />clusters at the expense of antiferromagnetic interactions which is responsible for the non-Griffiths phase. The presence of the large ferromagnetic clusters helps to create percolation path for electronic transport and is the probable reason for the enhancement of magnetoresistance in this temperature range. On the other hand, enhancement of low field magnetoresistance (LFMR)<br />observed below 100 K has been attributed to the increased spin polarized tunneling (SPT) component due to the increase in the size of the ferromagnetic clusters in the nanoparticle compares with that of bulk.
714	Saltwater Transport through Pristine and Positively Charged Graphene Membranes	Transport of saltwater through pristine and positively charged single-layer graphene nano-pore membranes are investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Pressure driven flows are induced by motion of specular reflecting boundaries at the feed and permeate sides with constant speed. Unlike previous studies in the literature, this method induces a desired flowrate and calculates the resulting pressure difference in the reservoirs. Due to the hexagonal structure of graphene, hydraulic diameters of the nano-pores are used to correlate the flowrate and pressure drop data. Simulations are performed for three different pore sizes and flowrates for the pristine and charged membrane cases. In order to create better statistical averages for the salt rejection rate ten different initial conditions of Na+ and Cl- distribution in the feed side are used for each simulation case. Using data from 180 distinct simulation cases and by utilizing the Buckingham Pi theorem we developed a functional relationship between the volumetric flowrate, pressure drop, pore-diameter and the dynamic viscosity of saltwater. A linear relationship between the volumetric flowrate and pressure drop is observed.  For the same flowrate and pore size, charged membranes exhibited larger pressure drops. Graphene membranes with 9.90 &#x00C5; pore dimeter resulted in 100% salt rejection with 104.9 L/h-cm2 water flux, requiring a pressure drop of 35.02 MPa.
715	Ferromagnetism in undoped ZnO thin films grwon by reactive sputtering	The observation of room-temperature ferromagnetism in undoped zinc oxide (ZnO) crystalline nanostructures has been attributed to point defects in the bulk and/or near the nanostructure surface.  One of the main candidates for this induced ferromagnetism is oxygen vacancies (V<sub>O</sub>).  In this work, the effect of V<sub>O</sub> on the ferromagnetic behavior of ZnO thin films deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering is studied.  The oxygen to argon ratio (O<sub>2</sub>/Ar) in the sputtering gas was changed from oxygen-deficient (20 %) to oxygen-rich (70 %) conditions.  The films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM).  The largest concentration of V<sub>O</sub>, smallest crystallite size and largest saturation magnetization were obtained for the film grown at the lowest O<sub>2</sub>/Ar ratio of 20 %, while the films grown at 30 % and 50 % showed a larger crystallite size and were diamagnetic.  These results suggest that the ferromagnetic behavior can be linked to a high concentration of V<sub>O</sub>.  Surprisingly, the film grown at an O<sub>2</sub>/Ar ratio of 70 % showed a weak ferromagnetic signal, indicating that another type of defect may also play an important role.
716	Enhancement of bioactivity of glass by deposition of nanofibrous Ti using high intensity laser induced reverse transfer method	Bioglass is a new generation of biomaterials that has desirable properties for biomedical applications. The aim of this research is to develop a new method for the enhancement of biocompatibility of glass and transparent materials by the deposition of Ti nanofibrous structures generated by a high intensity laser induced reverse transfer method (HILIRT). Titanium nanofibers with different porosity, fiber diameter, and biocompatibility are synthesized at various ranges of pulse frequency, power, and scanning speed combined with the HILIRT method. Features and biocompatibility of these deposited Ti coatings before and after 7 days immersion in simulated body fluid were compared. The results show increasing laser frequency and power leads to more Ti nanofiber generation and enhanced biocompatibility, while increasing laser scanning speed results in lower Ti nanofiber growth and lower biocompatibility. Combination of the laser parameters such as frequency, power, and scanning speed can optimize the deposited Ti nanofiber properties for a wide range of biomedical applications using transparent biomaterials.
717	Virtual Bound States Elements and their Effects on Magnetic and Electrical Properties of Fe-Ni based Metal Amorphous Nanocomposites	Metal amorphous nanocomposite (MANC) alloys, with compositions (Fe<sub>70</sub>Ni<sub>30</sub>)<sub>80-x</sub>Nb<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>B<sub>14</sub>TE<sub>x</sub> (0 &le; x &le; 5) and (Fe<sub>70</sub>Ni<sub>30</sub>)<sub>80-y</sub>Nb<sub>4+y</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>B<sub>14</sub> (0.5 &le; y &le; 2) were synthesized by planar flow casting. Samples were annealed at 440 &deg;C and strain-annealed at 440 &deg;C and 300 MPa. Resistivity was found to increase with small substitutions of TE elements. For V, further increases resulted in reduced B<sub>S</sub> from 1.2 T to 0.5 T, lower permeability, and higher H<sub>C</sub>. For Mo, further additions lowered B<sub>S</sub> to 0.6 T, and consistently reduced the permeability of strain-annealed ribbon, but had a smaller effect on the permeability of annealed ribbon. For Cr and Nb series, resistivity increased, and strain-annealed permeability was lower than the annealed permeability. There was no systematic worsening of B<sub>S</sub> or H<sub>C</sub>. XRD scans revealed a residual amorphous phase, and fcc Fe-Ni peaks. Lastly, toroidal core losses on (Fe<sub>70</sub>Ni<sub>30</sub>)<sub>79.5</sub>Nb<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>B<sub>14</sub>V<sub>1</sub> yielded W<sub>1.0/400 </sub>= 2.1 W/kg, and W<sub>1.0/1k</sub> = 6.0 W/kg.
718	Microwave probe stations with three-dimensional control of the magnetic field to study high-frequency dynamics in nanoscale devices	We present two microwave probe stations with motorized rotary stages for adjusting the magnitude and angle of the applied magnetic field. In the first system, the magnetic field is provided by an electromagnet and can be adjusted from 0 to ~ 1.4 T while its polar angle (&#x03B8;) can be varied from 0<sup>o</sup> to 360<sup>o</sup>. In the second systemsthe magnetic field is provided by a Halbach array permanent magnet, which can be rotated and translated to cover the full range of polar (&#x03B8;) and azimuthal (&#x03C6;) angles with a tunable field magnitude up to ~ 1 T. Both systems are equipped with microwave probes, bias-Ts, ampliers, and spectrum analyzers, to allow for microwave characterization up to 40 GHz, as well as software to automatically perform continuous large sets of electrical and microwave measurements.
719	Investigation of the relevant kinetic processes in the initial stage of a double-arcing instability in oxygen plasmas	A numerical investigation of the kinetic processes in the initial (nanosecond range) stage of the double-arcing instability was developed. The plasma-sheath boundary region of an oxygen-operated cutting torch was considered. The energy balance and chemistry processes in the discharge were described. It is shown that the double-arcing instability is a sudden transition from a diffuse (glow-like) discharge to a constricted (arc-like) discharge in the plasma-sheath boundary region arising from a field-emission instability. A critical electric field value of &#x2248; 10 MV/m was found at the cathodic part of the nozzle wall under the conditions considered. The field-emission instability drives in turn a fast electronic-to-translational energy relaxation mechanism, giving rise to a very fast gas heating rate of at least 1 K/ns, mainly due to reactions of preliminary dissociation of oxygen molecules via the highly excited electronic state O2(B3&#x03A3;u-) populated by electron impact. It is expected that this fast oxygen heating rate further stimulates the discharge contraction through the thermal instability mechanism.
720	<strong>Thermodynamic and structural investigation of some Au-based nanoalloys formed in condensation-coalescence process </strong><strong>using MD simulation</strong>	Catalysts which contain structurally-defined noble metal nanoclusters are of significant interests in the recent years due to their high activity, selectivity, and physical and chemical stability, relative to the corresponding monometallic components. In this research, we have investigated surface energy and relative stability of some Au-based clusters formed during gas-phase condensation using MD simulation. Trend of relative stability (the &Delta; parameter) of the formed clusters obeys the order: &Delta;<sub> Au-Pt</sub>&lt; &Delta;<sub> Au-Rh</sub>&lt; &Delta;<sub> Au-Cu</sub>&lt; &Delta;<sub> Au-Ag</sub>&lt; &Delta;<sub> Au-Pd</sub> . The results showed that the Au atoms tend to lie at the clusters surface whereas the other atoms lie at the cluster cores. In the Au-Ag nanocluster, the Au atoms tend to lie at the cluster cores. It is also shown at the following order of the surface energy exists at all simulation times: E<sub>S (Au-Pt)</sub>&lt; E<sub>S (Au-Rh)</sub>&lt; E<sub>S (Au-Ag)</sub>&lt; (E<sub>S (Au-Pd)</sub> , E<sub>S (Au-Cu)</sub>) which is in good agreement with the stability trend of the formed nanoclusters (with the exception of the Au-Cu cluster). Surprisingly, it is observed that the formed Au-Rh and Au-Pt had negative values of the surface energy which is in agreement with the &#x2206; parameter results and is due to the much stability of the formed Au<sub>0.5</sub>Rh<sub>0.5</sub> and Au<sub>0.5</sub>Pt<sub>0.5</sub> nanoclusters during the gas-phase condensation process. Our results also indicated some ordered structures such as fcc-like or hcp-like structures within the Au-Rh, Au-Pt, and Au-Ag clusters.
721	<strong>Forming-free resistive switching in solution-processed silicon nanocrystal thin film</strong>	We report a forming-free resistive switching using a solution-processed silicon nanocrystal (Si NC) thin film. A Si NC thin film is formed on an ITO/glass substrate by spin-coating a colloidal Si NC solution in air. The Si NC thin film shows bipolar resistive switching without a forming process. Electrical characteristics at low temperatures and in various gas environments suggest that a non-stoichiometric SiO<sub>x</sub> shell on Si NCs contributes to the resistive switching. We propose that the origin of the resistive switching is a conductive filament of oxygen vacancies in the SiO<sub>x</sub> shell by an electric field.
722	Phonon abundance-lifetime-stiffness transition by confinement and polarization	Combining the differential and the ultrafast phonon spectrometrics has reconciled, for the first time, the phonon abundance&ndash;lifetime&ndash;stiffness cooperative transition from the mode of ordinary water to the NaBr hydration and nano-confinement. The fraction coefficient of bond transition f<sub>NaBr</sub>(<em>C</em>) &micro; 1&ndash;exp(&ndash;<em>C</em>/<em>C</em><sub>0</sub>) follows the universal form for the concentrated salt solutions (C) and the f<sub>droplet</sub>(<em>D</em>) = 3DD/D follows the core&ndash;shell volume ratio for the sized nanostructures (<em>D</em>) with shell thickness D<em>D/2</em> = 0.90 &Aring; of the dangling H&ndash;O bond length. The phonon lifetime t<sub>solution</sub>(<em>C</em>) &micro; f<sub>NaBr</sub>(<em>C</em>) features the effect of ionic polarization and the t<sub>droplet </sub>(<em>R</em>) = t<sub>polarization</sub>(<em>D</em>) + t<sub>confinement</sub>(<em>D</em>) discriminates the skin polarization from the droplet boundary reflection. The polarization and boundary reflection lengthen the phonon lifetime by hindering the vibration&ndash;energy dissipation.
723	High efficient photothermal energy conversion of topologic insulator Bi2Se3 nanosheets thin film	The photothermal conversion has become rather attractive to realize the energy application. A simple, rapid and scalable optical-controlling Bi2Se3 nanosheets film heater is prepared by softly nondestructive rubbing technology and transferring to PET substrate under the assistance of PVA. The optical-controlling film heater exhibits the excellent adjustability, accuracy and stability of temperature. The film heater is first tested by using laser irradiation at 410 mW and the corresponding temperature rapidly increased to the 53.2 {degree sign}C in the 50 seconds for SThin, and 53.2 {degree sign}C in the 50 seconds for SThick. The SThin and SThick film display a flat transmittance of ~60% and from the visible to near-IR region, respectively. The optical-controlling film heating can be easily incorporated for optical or optical-electrical device without preparation of electrode. These exotic properties of Bi2Se3 nanosheets optical-controlling heater suggest exciting prospects for the temperature dependence flexible optoelectronics and electronic device.
724	<strong>Direct evidence for coexistence of nanoscale high -conductive and </strong><strong>low-conductive phases in VO<sub>2</sub> film</strong>	<strong> </strong>In this work, we carried out a systematic study on the nanoscale conductivity behaviors of VO<sub>2</sub> films by using conductive atomic force microscopy. Other than the macro-scale resistance-temperature characteristics, which demonstrate a steep insulator-metal transition of VO<sub>2</sub> at transition temperature, our present work demonstrated that nanoscale high-conductive phase and low-conductive phase will always coexist in either macroscale insulating state or metal state. The nanoscale high-conductive region appears at room temperature, at which the VO<sub>2</sub> film exhibits macroscale high resistance state. On the other hand, the nanoscale low-conductive phase appears at temperatures higher than the insulator-metal transition temperature. The area of the high-conductive region will increase with the increase of measurement temperature. The nanoscale current-voltage measurement indicate that the high-conductive state is not a good metal state, and the charge transport behaviors will change from a space charge limited current dominated mechanism to Shockley emission dominated mechanism, when the temperature increase from below to above phase change temperature.
725	NiMoO4 nanorods supported on nickel foam for high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials	Well-aligned hierarchical NiMoO4 nanorods are successfully grown on nickel foam by a facile hydrothermal method, and which can be directly used as integrated electrodes for supercapacitors without the addition of other ancillary materials such as binders or additives to enhance electrode cycling stability or conductivity. The samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. It is demonstrated that the achieved NiMoO4 nanorods are uniformly grown on nickel foam, and its diameter and length is estimated to be 100 nm and 3 &#x03BC;m on average, respectively. The results indicate that the NiMoO4 nanorods samples deliver high specific capacitances of 3412, 2490, 1740, 1496 F/g at 1, 4, 7 and 10 A/g, respectively. Furthermore, the excellent rate capability of the NiMoO4 nanorods based supercapacitors have been obtained in KOH electrolyte, demonstrate the as-prepared products can be a promising electrode material for supercapacitor.
726	Local carrier distribution imaging on few-layer MoS<sub>2</sub> exfoliated on SiO<sub>2</sub> by scanning nonlinear dielectric microscopy	We demonstrate that scanning nonlinear dielectric microscopy (SNDM) can be used for the nanoscale characterization of dominant carrier distribution on atomically thin MoS<sub>2</sub> mechanically exfoliated on SiO<sub>2</sub>. For stable imaging without damaging microscopy tips and samples, SNDM was combined with peak-force tapping mode atomic force microscopy. The identification of dominant carriers and their spatial distribution becomes possible even for single and few-layer number MoS<sub>2</sub> on SiO<sub>2</sub> using the proposed method allowing differential capacitance (d<em>C</em>/d<em>V</em>) imaging. We can expect that SNDM can also be applied to the evaluation of other two-dimensional semiconductors and devices.
727	Structural, magnetic and mechanical properties of Nd6.8Fe63.3Nb4.0Co1.3Cr1.1Zr0.9B22.6 nanocrystalline hard magnet prepared by injection casting method	Microstructural, magnetic and mechanical properties of nanocrystalline Nd6.8Fe63.3Nb4.0Co1.3Cr1.1Zr0.9B22.6 hard magnets produced by injection casting and subsequent thermo-magnetic annealing have been investigated in this study. X-ray diffraction studies reveal that phases present in the as-cast Nd6.8Fe63.3Nb4.0Co1.3Cr1.1Zr0.9B22.6 alloy are 60% Nd2Fe14B, 16% &#x03B1;-Fe, 9% Fe3B and 15% amorphous phases, whereby, Nd2Fe14B being the majority phase. Thermo-magnetic annealing induces a complete crystallization of the amorphous phase and develops an ideal trade-off balance between the fractions of magnetically soft and hard phases. The optimum hard magnetic properties such as coercivity (iHc) of 861 kA/m, remanence (Br) of 0.68 T and maximum energy product (BH)max of 81.9 kJ/m3 were obtained after magnetic annealing the Nd6.8Fe63.3Nb4.0Co1.3Cr1.1Zr0.9B22.6 alloy at 993 K for 15 min. Transmission electron microscope and magnetic property analysis reveal that good magnetic properties result from the magnetically exchange coupled Nd2Fe14B, &#x03B1;-Fe and Fe3B grains. The as-cast Nd6.8Fe63.3Nb4.0Co1.3Cr1.1Zr0.9B22.6 magnet with a diameter of 2 mm and 27 mm in length demonstrates the micro-Vickers hardness (Hv) of 960 {plus minus} 20 and compressive stress (&#x03C3;f) of 1270 {plus minus} 10 MPa, which tend to decrease by annealing process.
728	Two-Parameter Quasi-Ballistic Transport Model for Nanoscale Transistors	We show that by adding only two fitting parameters to a purely ballistic transport model, we can accurately characterize the current-voltage characteristics of nanoscale MOSFETs.  The model is an extension of Natori&rsquo;s model (J. Appl. Phys. 76, 4879 (1994)) and includes transmission probability and drain-channel coupling parameter. The latter parameter gives rise to a theoretical R<sub>ON</sub> that is significantly larger than those predicted previously. To validate our model, we fabricated n-channel MOSFETs with varying channel lengths.  We show the length dependence of these parameters to support a quasi-ballistic description of our devices.
729	Dielectric meta-walls for surface plasmon focusing and Bessel beam generation	Tailoring the wavefronts of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) freely is a central goal in plasmonics, but conventional approaches exhibit low efficiencies and/or require bulky devices. Here, we propose to utilize <em>ultrathin</em> dielectric meta-walls placed vertically on a plasmonic metal to <em>efficiently</em> reshape the wavefront of the launched SPP beam. Based on such a strategy, we experimentally demonstrate two effects in the microwave regime, which are focusing and Bessel beam generations of spoof SPPs. Near-field scanning measurements are in excellent agreement with full wave simulations. This work can inspire many applications related to SPP manipulations, such as enhanced nonlinear effect, nano-particle trapping, and so on.
730	Evidence for Glassy Relaxation in Crystals at High Deformation Rates	When investigated as a function of deformation rate and short time, model nano-crystals exhibit a clear threshold in mechanical and relaxation behavior, this observation being valid in both the Hooke (elastic) and plastic regime. At low deformation rate ($\dot\epsilon$~&lt;~$\dot\epsilon_c\simeq$5.10$^5$~s$^{-1}$), materials are able to equilibrate with ongoing deformation over the ns timescale, whereas ultra-fast deformations bring the system out off equilibrium on the same timescale. The time evolution of stress is investigated and suggests features that are typical of glassy relaxation with a stretched exponential behavior for stress relaxation that is only encountered for large deformation rates. Related relaxation times furthermore reveal a rapid increase with $\dot\epsilon$. These results actually link general aspects of plastic deformation, irreversibility at and thermal equilibrium.
731	Interfacial Properties of Water/Heavy Water layer Encapsulated in Bilayer Boron Nitride Nanochannel	Water interaction and transport through nanochannels of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials due to capillary pressures are in high demand. This letter reports interfacial properties of water/heavy water within boron nitride (BN) nanochennels with significant infrastructure applications. We demonstrate a series of <em>ab initio</em> based on density functional theory (DFT) computation on correlating the stability of adsorption and interfacial properties, decoding various synergies in the complex interfacial interations of water on BN nanocapillaries including the role of intermediate pressure of heterogeneous. We also provide a comparison of phonon vibrational modes of water and heavy water (D<sub>2</sub>O) captured in bilayer BN (BLBN) to compare their mobility as a key factor for separation mechanism. This finding, combined with the fundamental insights into the nature of interfacial properties provides key hypotheses for design of nanochannels.
732	Darcy-Forchheimer Flow of Micropolar Nanofluid in the Rotating Frame with Non-Uniform Heat Generation/Absorption	The present research aims to examine the Darcy-Forchheimer three-dimensional micropolar nanofluid between parallel and horizontal plates in a rotating system. The micropolar nanofluid in permeable media is described by assuming the Darcy-Forchheimer model where drenching permeable space obeys the Darcy-Forchheimer expression. The thermal radiation impact is taken to be varing in the absorption/generation for the purpose, to see the concentration as well as the temperature modifications between the nanofluid and the surfaces. The flow of micropolar nanofluid has been assumed in steady state. The rudimentary leading equations have been transformed to a set of differential nonlinear and coupled equations using suitable similarity variables. The homotopic approach has been used to acquire the solution of the modelled problems. The other physical impacts that is Skin friction, heat flux and mass flux have been studied. The influences of the porosity, rotation, inertia coefficient, Brownian motion and thermophoresis analysis of micropolar nanofluid have been mainly focused in this work.
733	Membrane-based methodology for scanning tunneling measurements in epitaxial quantum dot systems	Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) are key techniques for the advance of nano- and atomic scale science. Their use is, in a large extent, depending on ultra-high vacuum conditions, in which clean surfaces are obtained by in-situ procedures such as growth, annealing, sputtering or cleavage of the materials of interest. In this sense, a number of technical limitations are imposed to the study of nanostructures and thin films. Here we show that the use of chemically etched nanomembranes allows to carry out STS measurements in a system which was otherwise studied mainly under in-situ conditions. We were able to acquire STS spectra with energy level resolved response on InAs quantum dots grown within a 15nm-thick GaAs single-crystalline film transferred to a Au (111) surface. The presence of a native oxide layer does not affect the result, keeping the reliability of the usual UHV procedures. The use of nanomembranes also opens up the possibility of tailoring properties via additional variables such as nanomembrane thickness and surface charge depletion.
734	Modelling linear and non-linear rheology of polylactide/layered silicate nanocomposite regarding shear rate, temperature and formulation	The aims of this study were to bring mathematical models for numerical simulations and to improve the understanding of the rheological behaviour of nanocomposites based polylactide with different amounts of organo-modified clay. A modelling method was proposed to describe this behaviour under various variables: shear rate, temperature, clay loading, and molar mass. Ostwald-de Waele and Carreau-Yasuda laws were taken as basic models and then were completed by adding new dimensions on each parameter. Rheological measurements were corroborated by morphological observations to reveal three domains responding to different models. By separating the effect of the molar mass from that of the clay, the results suggested the decrease of shear viscosity compared to that of the neat polylactide essentially assigned to the molar mass degradation. Clay loading effect showed a three-way variation of the general level of non-linear shear viscosity, including a contribution between 1 wt% and 5 wt% to the previous decrease of shear viscosity. Time-temperature superposition principle was employed and highlighted a double distinct trend in function of the clay loading.
735	Comprehension of peculiar local emission behavior of InGaAs quantum well by co-localized nanocharacterization combining cathodoluminescence and electron microscopy techniques	Electronic and structural properties of an In_x Ga_(1-x) As quantum well (QW) stacking between AlAs barriers grown on 300mm (001) silicon substrate by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) were investigated. A nanometer scale and spatially co-localized characterization combining low temperature cathodoluminescence (CL) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was performed. The combined interpretation of luminescence and strain measurement provides an exhaustive landscape of such complex sample. Particularly, the obtained results provide a comprehensive analysis of specific peculiar luminescence feature. These luminescent regions, detected all over the sample, seems to be correlated to the local increase in the carbon content in AlAs barriers and in indium concentration in the InGaAs QW induced by local strain variations. These modifications alter the InGaAs QW properties and thus its optical efficiency.
736	<strong>The Study of Nanoheterostructures Transport Properties by The Local Cathodoluminescent Technique</strong>	A method for the study of the transport properties of nanoheterostructures in the direction of their growth is proposed. This technique is based on the dependence of cathodoluminescent area generation on the energy of electron beam. The size of the cathodoluminescence generation area is determined by the electron penetration interaction region and by the transport of electro-hole pairs to the place of their recombination. Several models for the description of the electro-hole pairs transport in nanogeterostructures were purposed. The transport properties of nanoheterostructures can be quantitatively compared for structures of different composition and design. This method was used for studying the heterostructures based on  ZnCdSSe and AlGaN.
737	Enhanced Room Temperature Ferromagnetism in ZnO Nanorods Decorated with Nanocrystalline (nc)-Au particles.	Enhanced room temperature ferromagnetism has been observed when nanocrystalline (<em>nc</em>) gold (Au) particles are decorated with ZnO-nanorods (ZnO-NRs) surface. The magnetic moment in <em>nc</em>-Au/ZnO-NRs with the optimum amount of <em>nc</em>-Au loading comes from mettalic electrons at the <em>nc</em>-Au/ZnO-NRs interface that includes large orbital magnetic moment at the interface. The presence of intrinsic defects like zinc materials (Zn<sub>i</sub>) and oxygen vacancies (V0) are established using Raman spectroscopy, X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy(UPS). Oxygen vacancy related surface defects were obtained from the O 1s XPS peak of different <em>nc</em>-Au/ZnO-NRs structure. The valence band maximum position and the work function (&#x0424;) of ZnO-NRs and <em>nc</em>-Au/ZnO-NRs hybrid nanostructures were obtained from UPS (He-I) measurement. The UPS (He-II) spectra suggests that the valence band density of states in the valence band of O 2<em>p</em> - Zn 4<em>sp</em> hybridized states of <em>nc</em>-Au/ZnO-NRs hybrid structure thin films is higher than pure ZnO-NRs thin film that could be correlated with higher magnetization. First principle density functional theory calculations show the enhancement of the density of states at the valence band region with decoration of optimum content <em>nc</em>-Au in ZnO-NRs surface along with increase of oxygen vacancies in <em>nc</em>-Au/ZnO-NRs that further confirms the enhancement of magnetization.
738	The surface effect of solid and hollow nanowires under diametral loading	The size effect of the surface parameters on the mechanical behavior of the solid and hollow nanowires is investigated under diametral loading. In order to address the newly proposed diametral compression test on the nanowires, the analytical solutions of solid and hollow nanowires under diametral loading are developed by considering the surface effect at the boundaries of the bulk materials. The solutions are validated by degenerating to other analytical solutions and comparing against the surface conditions. The surface effect on the circumferential stress is tested by varying the surface parameters, size of the nanowires, as well as the residual stress separately. Taking aluminum nanowires for example, certain surface parameters are found to have profound effects in changing the local stress distributions, especially when the outer radius of a nanowire is below 10nm. The mechanical response is also affected when the residual stress arrives a certain magnitude relative to the applied loading.
739	A high temperature gas flow environment for neutron total scattering studies of complex materials	We present the design and capabilities of a high temperature gas flow environment for neutron diffraction and pair distribution function (PDF) studies available at the Nanoscale Ordered Materials Diffractometer (NOMAD) instrument at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS).  Design considerations for successful total scattering studies are discussed, and a set of best practices for planning experiments, preparing samples, and collecting and reducing data are defined.  The new capabilities are demonstrated with an in situ decomposition study of a battery electrode material under inert gas flow and an in operando carbonation/decarbonation experiment under reactive gas flow. This capability will aid in identifying and quantifying the atomistic configurations of chemically reactive species and their influence on underlying crystal structures.  Furthermore, studies of reaction kinetics and growth pathways in a wide variety of functional materials can be performed across a range of length scales spanning the atomic to the nanoscale.
740	Dynamical Analysis for Nanofluid Slip Rheology with Thermal Radiation, Heat Generation / Absorption and Convective Wall Properties	In this analysis, we have presented the nanofluid rheology with slip effects over a convective wall. Simultaneous effects of non-linear thermal radiations and internal heat generation / absorption properties are taken into the account. Hydro-magnetic flow in the presence of a porous medium, thermophoresis and Brownian motion effects is analyzed. Mathematical modelling has been performed in order to obtain the governing relations of the physical problem. Numerical solutions for the velocity, temperature and mass fraction profiles have been computed using the finite-difference approach (FDM). Various graphical and numerical illustrations for several parameters have been presented into order to investigate physics behind the mathematical equations.
741	<strong>High-performance</strong><strong> structure of a coil-shaped soft-actuator consisting of polymer threads and carbon nanotube yarns</strong>	We fabricated thermally driven metal-free soft-actuators consisting of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) threads as the actuator and carbon nanotube (CNT) yarns as the heating source. The mechanical force and response behavior of various structures of the coil-shaped soft-actuators were characterized. The performance of the soft-actuators containing a homogenous arrangement of PET threads and CNT yarns in their cross-section profile was the highest. The results of the calculations based on the heat diffusion equations indicated that inhomogeneous heat generation in the soft-actuator causes parts of the actuator to remain unheated and this interferes with the mechanical motions. Homogenous thermal distribution in the soft-actuators, <em>i.e</em>., the use of the multifilament structure, provides the highest performance in terms of mechanical force.
742	3D graphene-like carbon/Polydimethylsiloxane nanocomposite for tensile and compressive strain sensors	Elastomeric matrix filled with carbon nanotubes or graphene has been focused for making resistive-type strain sensors. Here, we report the synthesis of 3D graphene-like carbon nanostructures by exploiting the chemical reaction between magnesium and carbon disulfide, and made piezoresistive nanocomposites of as-prepared carbon nanomaterials and polydimethylsiloxane rubber for tensile and compressive strain sensors. The stretchable strain sensor shows fast response and high gauge factor ~35. The compressive strain sensor is elaborated designed as in-plane and miniature concept. It also shows fast response to external force and good stability.
743	Dose regularization via filtering and projection: an open-source code forsoptimization-based proximity-effect-correction for nanoscale lithography	A new method for dose regularization in optimization-based proximity-effect-correction is proposed. In contrast to the commonly adapted approach of adding penalty terms to the objective function, a modified scheme is demonstrated where dose regularization is achieved via filtering and projection techniques. The resulting dose patterns are simple and two-toned, and can thus readily be adopted in production.  The validity of the scheme is assessed in experiments, where the resolvable feature size of the considered 30 kV electron-beam lithography system is decreased from around 100 nm to a few tens of nm. A Python implementation of the scheme is made freely available.
744	<strong>Tailoring the failure morphology of 2D bicrystalline graphene oxide</strong>	Aim of this article, is to study the effect of oxide functionalisation on the failure morphology of bicrystalline graphene. Molecular dynamics based simulations in conjunction with reactive force field were performed to study the mechanical properties as well as failure morphology of different configurations of bicrystalline graphene oxide. Separate simulations were performed with hydroxyl and epoxide functionalisation, and later on the same simulations were extended to study the graphene oxide as a whole. Authors have predicted that epoxide functionalisation helps in transforming the catastrophic brittle behavior into ductile. Failure morphologies depict that epoxide groups tend to boost the ductility through altering the fracture path and not affecting the grain boundaries either. Also, the epoxide to ether transformations were found to be the decisive mechanism behind the plastic response shown by epoxide groups. Simulations help in concluding a ductile failure for bicrystalline graphene in conjunction with oxidation of selective atoms in the nanosheet, which further opens new avenues for the application of these graphene sheets in nanodevices and nanocomposites.
745	<strong>LaFeO<sub>3</sub>- Pb(Zr<sub>0.58</sub>Ti<sub>0.42</sub>)O<sub>3 </sub>Multiferroic Nanocomposite: </strong><strong>Magnetoelectric Coupling, Electrical Transport and Dielectric Response</strong>	Room temperature magnetoelectric coupling of <em>x</em>LaFeO<sub>3</sub>-(1-<em>x</em>) Pb(Zr<sub>0.58</sub>Ti<sub>0.42</sub>)O<sub>3</sub> (<em>x</em> = 0.2 and 0.3) nanocomposites prepared through low temperature pyrophoric reaction process has been investigated. The magnetoelectric response has been measured as a function of applied magnetic field at different frequencies, which attributes the presence of magnetostriction properties of the piezomagnetic material. The study of dielectric constant of those nanocomposites gives evidence of Maxwell-Wagner interfacial or space charge polarization in the sample at low frequency regime. The ac electrical properties of those nanocomposites have been studied with different applied magnetic fields and temperatures. Complex impedance spectra have been fitted using parallel combinations of grain boundaries resistance and grain boundaries capacitance circuit. This supports the dominating role of grain boundaries contribution in electrical transport of the sample. Impedance study at different temperatures shows temperature dependent electrical relaxation process in the system. The activation energy is estimated from Nyquist plots, dc conductivity data by using the Arrhenius relation, which indicates that the same kind of charge carriers are responsible for relaxation process in grain boundaries of the sample. Furthermore, the ac conductivity of the nanocomposites has been investigated at different temperatures and fitted by Jonscher&rsquo;s power law. The conduction mechanism is mainly due to the small and large polaronic hopping in the system.
746	<SPAN style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: black;">Superlong uniform Light Tunnel Created by Focusing Radially Polarized Vortex Beam</SPAN>	A method of generating a super-long nanoscale light tunnel with longitudinal intensity variation less than three percent of the maximum is presented. A radially polarized vortex beam with topological charge of two can be focused into a relatively short light tunnel when the ring-like annular amplitude filter is used to block the outer annular part of the light beam or when an objective with relatively low numerical aperture is used. A fan-shaped division of the central part of light beam cross section with phase modulation scheme is adopted to generate four relatively short light tunnels simultaneously with exactly the same intensity distribution and optimized axial shaft. Based on these foundations, a super-long nanoscale light tunnel with uniform intensity is demonstrated both in simulation and experiment.<em>          </em>
747	Thermoelectric characterization of nickel-nanowires and nanoparticles embedded in silica aerogels	Embedded nickel nanowires (NiNWs) and nickel nanoparticles (NiNPs) in silica aerogels at three different concentrations are characterized by scanning thermal microscopy, a Hot disk method and four probe measurements to consider them as potential thermoelectric materials. NiNW samples exhibit 9 orders of magnitude improvement in thermoelectric figure of merit while the embedded NiNPs samples show a 6 orders of magnitude improvement when the concentrations are increased from 0 to 700 ppm. The electrical resistivity is highly sensitive to the concentration of NiNWs and NiNPs in the silica aerogels, while the thermal conductivity remains largely unchanged. The electrical conductivity &#x1D70E; is shown to follow a percolation scaling law of the form &#x1D70E;&prop;(&#x1D44A;&minus;&#x1D44A;&#x1D450;)<sup>&#x1D461;</sup> with critical weight fraction (&#x1D44A;&#x1D450;) to form a conductive network of approximately at 0.04-0.6 Wt% and 0.08-0.1 Wt% for embedded NiNWs and NiNPs, respectively. The results suggest that optimizing the concentration of NiNWs could yield promising thermoelectric properties.
748	<strong>Molecular beam epitaxy of single-crystalline aluminum film</strong><strong> for low threshold ultraviolet plasmonic nanolasers</strong>	High-quality single-crystalline aluminum films have been grown on Si(111) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. X-ray diffraction rocking curve of the (111) plane of the Al film shows a full width at half maximum of 564 arcsec for the sample grown at 100&deg;C, where the surface is atomically flat with a root-mean-square roughness of 0.40 nm in a scanned area of 3&times;3 &mu;m<sup>2</sup>. By using such high-quality Al film, we have demonstrated a room temperature ultraviolet surface-plasmon-polariton nanolaser at wavelength of 360 nm with a threshold as low as ~ 0.2 MW/cm<sup>2</sup>, which provides a powerful evidence for potential application of single-crystalline Al film in plasmonic devices.
749	Diameter dependent threshold voltage modification of resistive state switching in organometallic single nanowire devices (diameter ~ 10-100 nm)	Reversible electrical resistive state switching (ERSS) and memory effect have been investigated for a wide range of organometallic compounds and device configurations where underlying mechanism is still not fully explored. We synthesized nanowires (NWs) of organometallic charge transfer complexes between pre-fabricated electrodes with diameter (<em>d</em>) 10 &le;<em> d &le; </em>100 nm and their ERSS properties have been systematically investigated at 300K encompassing versatile measurement techniques. The lowest dimensional NW with <em>d ~ </em>10 nm, switched to its low resistive state with very low applied voltage. It appeared as metallic in switched state as confirmed by its current-voltage characteristics and temperature (<em>T</em>) dependent resistivity for 100 <em>&le; T &le; </em>300 K. Supported by a theoretically simulated model, we proposed a possible mechanism for the single metallic filament formation in an almost defect-free 10 nm wire in its switched state considering the migration of metal ions created by a strong electric field between two very closely spaced electrodes. We also experimentally demonstrated that the diameter dependence of the threshold voltage (<em>V<sub>th</sub></em>) for switching follows a power law (<em>V<sub>th </sub>&infin; d<sup>&delta;</sup></em>) which is independent of the electrode configurations and growth mechanism. The results explained the strategies to engineer the ERSS properties of single NW devices and might be beneficial for further research and development.
750	<strong>Self-assembled single-digit nanometer memory cells</strong>	The current spintronics research focuses on lowering switching energy and maintaining good thermal stability of nanomagnets which could ensure further development of memory technology. Here, we investigate single-digit nanometer magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) composed of self-assembled FePt nanopillars isolated by the crystallized ZrO<sub>2</sub>. We find that the lateral size range of the operational device could be sub-7-nm by maintaining outstanding thermal stability.
751	Ag-Cu Nanoparticles Supported on N-Doped TiO2 Nanowire Arrays for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction	Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into various types of fuels has attracted great interest, and serves as a potential solution to address current global warming and energy challenges.  In this work, Ag-Cu nanoparticles are densely supported on N-doped TiO2 nanowire through a straightforward nanofabrication approach.  The light absorption range of N-doped TiO2 can be tuned to match the plasmonic band of Ag nanoparticles, which allows synergizing a resonant energy transfer process with the Schottky junction.  Meanwhile, Cu nanoparticles can provide active sites for CO2 reduction.  As a result, the photocatalytic performance in photocatalytic CO2 reduction is improved to achieve a CH4 production rate of 720 &#x03BC;mol&#x00B7;g-1&#x00B7;h-1 under full-spectrum irradiation.
752	Synergistic Enhancements in the Performances of DSSC by the Scattering and Plasmon Resonance of Au-Nanoparticle Hollow Multishell Microspheres	Novel hollow multishell SiO2@Au@TiO2 (HSAT) microspheres are synthesized by multi-step method to form their composite photoanodes and dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The composite photoanodes and DSSCs with different amount of HSAT microspheres are studied. The study indicates that the HSAT microspheres have enhanced the scattering and absorption of incident light in the photoanode, reduced the interface transmission resistance, increased the electron lifetime, and thus significantly improved the short-circuit current (Jsc) and photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of the DSSCs. The maximal Jsc and PCE of the optimal DSSC doped with HSAT microspheres are 15.83 mA cm-2 and 7.21 %, greatly enhanced by 21.0 % and 20.4 %, respectively, than those of the conventional DSSC with pure TiO2 photoanode. These remarkable enhancements in the properties of the DSSCs can be attributed to the dual effects of HSAT microspheres, i.e., the localized surface plasmon resonance of Au nanoparticles inside the shells and the strong light scattering of hollow spheres, their synergistic and complementary effects have significantly improved the absorption and utilization on incident light and thus the PCE of DSSC. Such synergistic and complementary effects of the different functions are also likely expected to play roles in the performance improvements in other similar solar cells.
753	Nonlocal and nonlinear contributions to the thermal and elastic high-frequency wave propagations at nanoscale	We analyze the role played by nonlocal and nonlinear effects in the propagation of thermal and elastic high-frequency waves in nanosystems. The study is performed both in the case of a rigid body (i.e., for heat pulse propagation), and in the case of a non-rigid body (i.e., for thermoelastic pulse propagation). In the framework of Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics the compatibility of our theoretical models with second law is proved.
754	<strong>Plasmonic surface relief gratings for tunable optical band-pass filter </strong><strong><strong>application</strong></strong>	The experimental results of optical diffraction of plasmonic surface relief grating having a periodicity of 10, 5 and 3.4 &micro;m are presented. These structures find a major application as a band-pass filter in visible spectral range. The fabrication of grating structures on the silver halide based film is carried out using the electron beam raster scan in a conventional scanning electron microscopic. Morphological characterization of the gratings is performed using an atomic force microscope. It shows that the period, height and profile of the grating depend upon the lines per frame, beam spot, single line dwells time, beam current, and accelerating voltage of the electron beam. Optical transmission of 10 &micro;m period grating show a well-defined localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) dip in the spectra. This LSPR dip corresponds to gelatin embedded silver nanoparticles in the grating structure. The LSPR dip becomes prominent as the period of the grating is reduced. The maximum first-order optical diffraction efficiency and bandwidth for a 10 &micro;m period grating are observed as 4% and 400 nm in the visible wavelength range respectively. As the periodicity has reduced both optical diffraction efficiency and bandwidth reduces. The optical diffraction efficiency and bandwidth for 3.4 &micro;m periodic grating were observed as 0.03% and 100 nm respectively. The profile of optical diffraction efficiency is significantly flat within the bandwidth for each of the gratings. Finally, an assessment of the role of LSPR absorption and varied grating period in the development of the optical diffraction efficiency profile is presented.
755	Design of FPGA based system identification module with application to atomic force microscopy	The science of system identification is widely utilized in modeling input-output relationships of diverse systems. In this article we report field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) based implementation of a real-time system identification algorithm which employs forgetting factors and bias compensation techniques. The FPGA module is employed to estimate mechanical properties of surfaces of materials at the nano-scale with atomic force microscopy (AFM). The FPGA module is user friendly which can be interfaced with commercially available AFMs. Extensive simulation and experimental results validate the design.
756	Synthesis and electrochemical properties of Si(Silicide)/Exfoliated graphite nanocomposite anode for lithium-ion rechargeable batteries	Silicon-based nanocomposites have been attracted noteworthy attention as an anode material for lithium-ion secondary batteries. In this work, nano-scale Si-FeSi2 powders encapsulated in the exfoliated graphite (EG) to prepare a novel nanocomposite Si-FeSi2/EG anode synthesized by a scalable two-stage high-energy mechanical milling.  Remarkably, the Si-FeSi2/EG electrode demonstrate stable reversible capacity about 1002 mAhg-1 even at 50th cycle with a coulombic efficiency ~99.8%. The irreversible capacity loss after the 1st, 3rd and 50th cycle was 21, 2.2 and 0.2, respectively. The significant cyclic performance was mainly ascribed to the silicon particle size and encapsulation of active Si-FeSi2 in the exfoliated graphite.
757	In-situ plasma monitoring of PECVD nc-Si:H films and influence of dilution ratio on structural evolution	We report plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) hydrogenated nano-crystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) thin films. In particular, the effect of hydrogen dilution ratio (R= H2/SiH4) on structural and optical evolutions of the deposited nc-Si:H films were systematically investigated including Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and low angle X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD). Measurement results revealed that the nc-Si:H structural evolution, primarily the transition of nano-crystallization from the amorphous state to the nanocrystalline state, can be carefully induced by the adjustment of hydrogen dilution ratio (R). In addition, in-situ plasma diagnostic tool of optical emission spectroscopy (OES) was used to further characterize the crystallization rate index (H&#x03B1;* / SiH*) that increases when hydrogen dilution ratio (R) rises whereas the deposition rate decreases. Another in-situ plasma diagnostic tool of quadruple mass spectrometry (QMS) also confirmed that the "optimal" range of hydrogen dilution ratio (R=30-40) can yield nano-crystalline silicon (n-Si:H) growth due to the depletion of higher silane radicals.
758	<strong>Asymmetric-structure-induced self rectifying for the pure HfO<sub>2</sub> 1R selector in nanoscale RRAM array</strong>	<strong>Asymmetric-structure-induced self-rectifying selector was realized in Pt/HfO<sub>2</sub>/n<sup>+</sup>-Si </strong><strong>resistive random access memory (RRAM) using a pure HfO<sub>2</sub> layer with asymmetric structure. The device exhibits repeatable self-rectifying resistive switching (RS) behavior with relatively high rectifying ratio. The nanoscale electrostatic effect induced by the asymmetric structure is responsible for the diode-like rectifying behavior of HfO<sub>2</sub> layer. Since this kind of rectifying is based on universal nanoelectronical physics, it is thus released from the material limitation, and thus paves a new way for resolving sneak current issue in RRAM arrays. </strong>

760	Virtual Bound States Elements and their Effects on Magnetic and Electrical Properties of Fe-Ni based Metal Amorphous Nanocomposites	Metal amorphous nanocomposite (MANC) alloys, with compositions (Fe<sub>70</sub>Ni<sub>30</sub>)<sub>80-x</sub>Nb<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>B<sub>14</sub>TE<sub>x</sub> (0 &le; x &le; 5) and (Fe<sub>70</sub>Ni<sub>30</sub>)<sub>80-y</sub>Nb<sub>4+y</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>B<sub>14</sub> (0.5 &le; y &le; 2) were synthesized by planar flow casting. Samples were annealed at 440 &deg;C and strain-annealed at 440 &deg;C and 300 MPa. Resistivity was found to increase with small substitutions of TE elements. For V, further increases resulted in reduced B<sub>S</sub> from 1.2 T to 0.5 T, lower permeability, and higher H<sub>C</sub>. For Mo, further additions lowered B<sub>S</sub> to 0.6 T, and consistently reduced the permeability of strain-annealed ribbon, but had a smaller effect on the permeability of annealed ribbon. For Cr and Nb series, resistivity increased, and strain-annealed permeability was lower than the annealed permeability. There was no systematic worsening of B<sub>S</sub> or H<sub>C</sub>. XRD scans revealed a residual amorphous phase, and fcc Fe-Ni peaks. Lastly, toroidal core losses on (Fe<sub>70</sub>Ni<sub>30</sub>)<sub>79.5</sub>Nb<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>B<sub>14</sub>V<sub>1</sub> yielded W<sub>1.0/400 </sub>= 2.1 W/kg, and W<sub>1.0/1k</sub> = 6.0 W/kg.
761	Observation of the Growth of Single-Crystalline MAPbBr3 Thin Film Based on Space-Confined Method	Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite single-crystalline thin films (SCTFs) are promising for enhancing photoelectric device performance. Here, we found that weak wetting substrate could reduce friction force and promote precursor ion diffusion, which enabled a continuous growth of SCTFs along in-plane direction.We observed some signs of island growth model. Pyramid-shaped island formed first and then converged, to achieve lateral growth of SCTFs. However, the lateral crystal growth was limited by the inefficient and anisotropic long range transportation of precursor ions along the micrometer-size or nanometer-size gap. Low ion diffusion is the main constraint for the preparation of the larger and thinner SCTFs.
762	<strong>Suppression of coffee ring: (Particle) size matters</strong>	<em>Coffee ring pattern in drying sessile droplet, is undesirable in various practical applications. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that on hydrophobic substrates, the coffee ring can be suppressed just by increasing the particle diameter. Larger size of the particles flocculate within the evaporation timescale leading to significant gravimetric settling (for Pe&gt;1) triggering a uniform deposit. Interestingly, the transition to a uniform deposit is found to be independent of the internal flow field and substrate properties. Flocculation of particles also alters the particle packing at nanoscale resulting in order to disorder transitions. In this letter, we exhibit a physical exposition on how particle size affects morphodynamics of the droplet drying at macro-nano length scales.</em>
763	<strong>Twinned boron nitrate nanocrystals as a proof of size-induced hexagonal-to-cubic phase transition</strong>	The explication of the origins of twinned structure of nanocrystalline grains of cubic boron nitride (c-BN) is presented. Such domain structure is a proof on structural transition from hexagonal to cubic phase during experimental path. As a result, the size based reduction in the transition temperatures required the change of phase diagram of nanocrystalline BN with respect to the diagram of bulk crystal.
764	<strong>Sequential subtractive and additive fabrication of tungsten micro-nano hierarchical structures under femtosecond laser irradiation</strong>	Femtosecond laser processing based top-down and bottom-up methods are both desired for the controllable preparation of ordered micro-nano functional structures. Here, taking tungsten as an example, we demonstrate that the femtosecond laser irradiation on solid surfaces can be developed as not only a top-down approach via the subtractive ablation process but also a bottom-up approach via the additive self-deposition process. The critical conditions for both processes to occur alternately and sequentially are investigated, with a unique kind of micro-nano hierarchical structures featuring with ordered micro cone arrays capped by controllable sand-dune like structures being fabricated. The uncovered laser-matter interaction mechanism can be inspiring for the development of new femtosecond laser fabrication techniques, and provide us more flexibility in designing and preparing the functional micro-nano surface structures.
765	<strong>Nanoclusters of &alpha;-Fe naturally formed after martensitic transformation in twinned martensite</strong>	Various Fe-C binary alloys with carbon content from 0.05 to 2.0 (wt.%) have been prepared and water-quenched at austenitizing temperatures. Fine structure of the twinned martensite in the quenched samples has been investigated by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in order to understand the initial products during the formation of martensite structure. In the twinned structure (body-centered-cubic {112}&lt;111&gt;-type twin), TEM dark field observations have revealed that both matrix and twinned crystal regions are fully composed of ultra-fine particles (&alpha;-Fe nano-crystallites). The particles tend to have the same preferred direction (or texture) in the twinned martensite and the size is almost the same (1~2 nm). The ultra-fine particle structure has been commonly observed regardless of carbon content, but the existence of the fine particle structure is limited in the twinned martensite. After in-situ TEM heating, recrystallization occurred and the fine particles merged into larger &alpha;-Fe grains; at the same time, the twinned relationship also disappeared.
766	Time Resolved Photoluminescence Studies of degradation in GaInP/GaAs/Ge solar cells after 1MeV electron irradiation	The electrical properties of solar cells would degrade in space due to radiation environment. Among all the electrical parameters, lifetime of minorities is most sensitive one. Time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) is a powerful method to character the behaviors of carriers as it has high time revolution that could reflect the reactions of carriers within nanoseconds. However the complex drift and diffusion in solar cells make the spectroscopy analysis much difficult. One dimension numerical calculations are used to investigate the diffusion, drifting and recombination of carriers, and the time-dependent photoluminescence decay was simulated. Calculation shows that both lifetime of minorities and light intensities would change the line shape of TRPL. The bimolecular recombination would change the curve from single-exponential to non-single-exponential one.<strong> </strong>By comparing with measured TRPL curves, one could get the lifetime of minorities in GaAs sub-cell. GaInP/GaAs/Ge solar cells were fabricated and irradiated by 1MeV electrons to study the decay of lifetimes of minorities. Fitting results show that the damage factor of lifetime of minorities in the middle GaAs solar cell under 1MeV electron irradiation is about <em>K&tau;</em>=4.8&times;10<sup>-15</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/ns, which is similar with the calculated result from photoluminescence (PL) measurements.
767	Energy dissipation contributed on the machined depth via dynamic plowing lithography of AFM	In this study, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip-based dynamic plowing lithography (DPL) approach is employed to scratch on the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) thin-film surface. A theoretical model is established based on the relationship between the tip energy dissipation and material removal volume, and the corresponding experiments are also conducted. Both the theoretical and experimental results show that the drive amplitude is proportional to the square of the machined depth of the nanoscale grooves. The mean deviations between the predicted and experimental depths are less than 10%. It is also indicated that the scratching velocity in the range of 0.01-80 &#x03BC;m/s is proportional to the square of the depth (1/h2), and the mean deviations between the predicted and experimental depths are also less than 7%. In addition, based on the above conclusions, a uniform ripple with desired dimensions can be achieved successfully by overlapping the machined nanogrooves. The wavelength and amplitude of the ripples are determined by controlling the feature size of nanogrooves.
768	<strong>Quantification of charge carriers participating in AFM to WFM magnetic phase transition in Na doped LaFeO<sub>3</sub> nano multiferroics</strong>	Multiferroic La<sub>1-x</sub>Na<sub>x</sub>FeO<sub>3</sub> (x=0.0, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.15) nanoparticles have been synthesized by citrate sol-gel auto combustion method. It is uniquely known for homogeneous distribution of particle size due to low temperature synthesis condition.  The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction pattern has exhibited the single phase orthorhombic perovskite structure. It is confirmed from micro Raman analysis that hole doping (Na) produces a structural crossover from Pnma to Pbnm space group. The red shift observed in UV-visible spectroscopy indicates shrinkage of band gap. Photoluminescence analysis independently supports the band gap shrinkage by the existence of violet-blue emission due to charge disproportion by oxygen related defects.  A changeover from semiconductor to metallic nature accompanied by the hopping of charge carrier between Fe<sup>3+</sup> to Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>4+ </sup>exchange interaction has revealed considerable increase in conductivity and dielectric constant. Finally, the doping helps to induce an antiferromagnetic (AFM) to weak ferromagnetic (WFM) state due to free carrier concentration. It is found that the hole driven Fe<sup>3+</sup> to Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>4+ </sup>exchange interactions with change in the Bohr magneton values from 4 &micro;<sub>B</sub> to 4.9 &micro;<sub>B</sub> are responsible for variation in the magnetization values.
769	<strong>Epitaxial ferroelectric Hf<sub>0.5</sub>Zr<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>2</sub> thin film on buffered YSZ substrate through interface reaction</strong>	In this study, we used pulsed laser deposition to successfully grow epitaxial Hf<sub>0.5</sub>Zr<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (HZO) films on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates using TiN as bottom electrode. It is found that the dual regulation structure of a TiO<sub>2</sub> buffer layer formed by interface reaction is the key to the epitaxial growth. The epitaxial HZO films exhibit ferroelectric behaviour with a remnant polarization up to 20 mC/cm<sup>2</sup>. X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy reveal the presence of nano domains, and clear epitaxial relation among different layers whose interfaces are relaxed by reconstruction. X-ray absorption spectroscopy provides deep insight into the microstructural origin of ferroelectricity in HZO, where the interface strain engineered ferroelectric state is manifested by the pseudo Jahn-Teller type of non-centrosymmetric <em>P</em>ca2<sub>1</sub> distortions.
770	<strong>Local lateral integration of 16-nm thick Ge nanowires on silicon on insulator substrates</strong>	In this contribution, we report on the growth of horizontal Ge nanowires inside extremely thin tunnels surrounded by oxide. This is achieved through selective lateral growth of Ge on silicon-on-insulator (001) substrates. The 16 nm high tunnels are formed by HCl vapor etching of Si followed by Ge growth in the same epitaxy chamber. Firstly, the benefit of growing the Ge nanowires at high temperature was highlighted to homogenize the length of the nanowires and achieve a high growth rate. Afterwards, we showed that increasing the tunnel depth led to a significant reduction of the growth rate. Finally, transmission electron microscopy showed that no defects were present in an array of ten Ge nanowires. These results are encouraging for the planar co-integration of heterogeneous materials on Si.
771	<strong>Dimension effect on the in-depth phase transition of MnAs/GaAs(001): from a thin film to a nano rod</strong>	We explore the dimension effect on the in-depth phase transition behavior of MnAs thin films on GaAs substrate by investigating the in-depth strain distribution with experiments and simulations. The strain distribution along the film growth direction is verified to be changed when a two-dimension thin film is thinned into a one-dimension nano-rod as a cross-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) specimen, thus resulting in a significantly different transition behavior. Our work brings more insights into the transition mechanism of MnAs thin films and illustrates a noteworthy issue in TEM studies of the phase transition at the interface of epitaxial thin films.
772	<strong>AsH<sub>3</sub> Gas-Phase Ex-Situ Doping 3D Silicon Structures</strong>	Dopant incorporation in Si can be done in-situ during epitaxial growth, or ex-situ for localised material modification from a variety of sources including ion, solid, liquid, or gas. Gas-phase doping has the advantage that it does not require a thin film deposition, it should be more effective at entering tight spaces than a liquid, and it should be less damaging and more conformal than a beam-line ion implant. In this work we apply arsine (AsH<sub>3</sub>) gas at ~atmospheric pressures in order to n-type dope three-dimensional (3D) Si device structures. It was observed that the gas-phase doping can be either corrosive or gentle to thin-body Si depending on the process conditions. Initial doping processes caused damage to the Si due to etching but after process optimisation the structural integrity of the Si nanostructures could be maintained successfully. Moreover, it was noted that evaluating doping processes entirely on planar Si surfaces can be misleading: processes which appear promising initially may not be transferrable to non-planar thin-body structures like fins or nanowires, due to the unwanted Si etching effect. Overall, we found that gas-phase doping with AsH<sub>3</sub> could provide &gt;10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>-3 </sup>electrically active As concentrations. This high As incorporation makes gas-phase doping very attractive for future gate-all-around devices, where the space between features will decline with continued transistor scaling.
773	Correlation anisotropy and stiffness of DNA molecules confined in nanochannels	The anisotropy of the orientational correlations in DNA molecules confined in cylindrical channels is explored by Monte Carlo simulation using a coarse-grained model of dsDNA. We find that the correlation function &lt;C(s)&gt;&#xF05E; in the transverse (confined) dimension exhibits the region of negative values in the whole range of channel sizes. Such a clear-cut sign of an opposite orientation of the chain segments represents a microscopic validation of the Odijk deflection mechanism in the narrow channels. At moderate-to-weak confinement, the negative &lt;C(s)&gt;&#xF05E; correlations imply a preference of DNA segments for transverse looping. The inclination for looping can explain the reduction of stiffness as well as enhanced knotting of confined DNA relative to that in bulk detected earlier at some channel sizes. Furthermore, it is shown, that the orientational persistence length Por fails to convey the apparent stiffness of DNA molecules in channels. Instead, the correlation lengths P&#x2551; and P&#xF05E; in the axial and transverse directions, respectively, encompass the channel-induced modifications of DNA stiffness.
774	Photonic trimming of quantum emitters via direct fabrication of metallic nanofeatures	In this paper we demonstrate the control of the emission of a GaAs quantum dot embedded in a GaAs/AlGaAs nanowire by the post-fabrication of a plasmonic grating on its surface. Using a direct electron beam induced deposition of Pt nanowires, we demonstrate an enhancement of the emission efficiency for the polarization parallel to the nanowires of 45%, with a 17% reduction of the photon lifetime. We believe that these results will help establish a new hybrid nanophotonic platform for efficient single photon sources.
775	Morphology and optical properties of Eu&sup2;&#x207A;-sensitized CsI(Na) thick film	Eu co-doping of CsI(Na) thick film was deposited by thermal evaporation on quartz substrate coated with a nano-reflective layer. The morphology and structure of these studied films, using SEM images and XRD patterns, had no distinguishable differences. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy ICP (OES) was utilized in order to measure sodium and europium concentrations in the deposition. Moreover, their optical properties were investigated by UV absorption, excitation, and emission spectroscopy in the wavelength region 200&#x2012;800 nm. The results indicated that Eu-sensitizing material enhanced the luminescence intensity of the CsI(Na) columnar-structure film compared to a conventional CsI(Na) scintillator. This increase was attributed to both Eu high quantum efficiency and energy transfer between the activator and sensitizer, considered with a view to improving scintillator properties. Ion beam induced luminescence (IBIL) measurements also confirm the luminescence results.
776	Correlation between Raman shift, Neel temperature, and optical band gap of NiO nanoparticles and their size dependences	With structural miniaturization down to the nanoscale, the detectable parameters of materials no longer remain constant but become tunable. For NiO nanoparticles example, Raman shift and Neel temperature increase while optical band gap decreases with increasing the nanoparticle size. Herein, we developed the models to describe the size dependences of these seemingly uncorrelated parameters for NiO nanoparticles, based on the size-dependent cohesive energy model. Consistency between our theoretical predictions and the corresponding experimental results not only verified the accuracy of our developed models but also provided straight forward insight into the essentiality of cohesive energy in describing the effect of size on the materials properties of NiO nanoparticles.
777	<strong>Indication of Direct and Indirect band structure in modified Co-doped CeO<sub>2</sub></strong>	CeO<sub>2</sub> has a band structure and bandgap which has been controversially reported sometimes direct or indirect. Sometimes there are changes in band structure due to changes in lattice. Strain induced transformation of direct to indirect bandgap has been theoretically predicted in ZnO. Similar story in CeO<sub>2</sub> may happen. A careful study involves increment in strain and related band structure changes, have been targeted in this study by Co incorporation in Ce<sub>1-x</sub>Co<sub>x</sub>O<sub>2</sub> nanopowders. A solid solution and homogeneity of the samples has been ensured by intentionally choosing a sol-gel synthesis route.  The analysis takes support of X-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX), UV-visible spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy techniques for structural and optical characterization. The possibility of phonon participation in electronic transition has been discussed using Tauc plot.
778	Improving detection efficiency of superconducting nanowire single-photon detector using multilayer antireflection coating	Double-cavity with backside optical coupling is one of the prevalent optical structures for superconducting nanowire single photon detector. A single layer anti-reflection coating (ARC) on the backside of the substrate was often adopted to enhance the transmittance to the substrate. We here applied a multilayer ARC to further increase the transmittance from 94.5% to 99.5%. NbTiN SNSPD made on such a substrate with double cavity structure presented a system detection efficiency of 90.1% at a dark count rate (DCR) of 100 Hz, which is the best value reported for backside optical coupled SNSPD at 1550 nm. Besides, it showed a timing jitter of ~40ps and the recovery time constant of ~22ns.
779	<strong>Thermally Activated Delayed</strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong><strong><strong>Fluorescence Organic Dots for Two-Photon Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging</strong></strong>	Auto&#xFB02;uorescence is a major challenge in complex tissue imaging when molecules present in the biological tissue compete with the &#xFB02;uorophore. This issue may be resolved by designing organic molecules with long fluorescence lifetimes. The present work reports the two-photon absorption properties of a thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecule with carbazole as electron donor and dicyanobenzene as electron acceptor (i.e., 4CzIPN). The results indicate that 4CzIPN exhibits moderate two-photon brightness (~5.7 &times; 10<sup>&minus;50</sup> cm<sup>4</sup> s photon<sup>&minus;1</sup>) and a long fluorescence lifetime (~1.47 microsecond). 4CzIPN was compactly encapsulated into an amphiphilic copolymer via nanoprecipitation to achieve water-soluble organic dots. Interestingly, 4CzIPN organic dots have been utilized in applications involving two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging. Our work aptly demonstrates that TADF molecules are promising candidates of nonlinear optical probes for developing next-generation multiphoton FLIM  applications.
780	Large-scale preparation of zno nanostructure from electric arc furnace dust	Abstract: zinc oxide nanostructures are prepared in a large scale through selective leaching zinc from electric arc furnace dust (EAF) using a deep eutectic solvent (DES), followed by precipitation of ZnO from DES upon introduction of a simple antisolvent water. The zinc and lead are selectively dissolved in ChCl-urea deep eutectic solvent and the lead ions in leaching solution are removed by cementation with zinc plates. The addition of deionized water to the resulting solution leads to formation of mixed precipitate of ZnO and zinc carbonate hydroxide, calcination of which generates ZnO nanostructures. The ZnO nanostructures are spherical which is composed of ultrathin mesoporous nanosheets with a thickness of around 10 nm and pore sizes about 10-40 nm. Especially, this ZnO nanoclusters have a high specific surface area and exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity as good as that of a commercial photocatalyst P-25 TiO2 in the terms of photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange.
781	High energy X-ray radiography of laser-shock metal dynamic fragmentation using high-intensity short-pulse laser	The dynamic fragmentation of shock-loaded high-Z metal is of considerable importance for both basic and applied science. The areal density and mass-velocity distribution are crucial factors in understanding this issue. Experimental methods, such as pulsed X-ray radiography and proton radiography, have been utilized to obtain information on such factors; however, they are restricted to a complex device and the spatial resolution in the order of 100 &#x03BC;m. In this work, we present the high-quality radiography of the dynamic fragmentation of laser shock-loaded tin, with good two-dimensional (2D) spatial resolution. Dynamic fragmentation is generated via the intense nanosecond-laser shock-loaded tin. A high-energy X-ray source is realized by the interaction of intense picosecond-pulses with an Au micro-wire target, attached to a low-Z substrate material. A high 2D resolution of 12 &#x03BC;m is achieved by point-projection radiography. The dynamic-fragmentation radiography is clear, and the signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently high, for a single-shot experiment. This unique technique has potential application in high energy density experiments.
782	Temperature and carrier density dependence of electron effective mass and band gap in semiconductor carbon nanotubes at elevated temperature: analytical calculations	The effects of temperature and carrier density on the self-energy of electrons in semiconductor carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are theoretically studied by using the Matsubara Green's function approach. We show that the band gap is slightly changed whereas the eletron effective mass is strongly affected by the temperature and electron density. Furthermore, an interesting discrepancy of the results obtained from the screening dynamical approximation and that from the Hartree-Fock approximation is shown. Especially, the calculated quantities are compared to the results obtained in a recent experiment and a good agreement for the energy shift is seen. These results could help clarifying the role of the Coulomb interaction and the correlation and exchange energy on the optical properties of CNTs in a wide range of temperature and density.
783	<strong>Universal rotation of nanowires in static uniform electric fields in viscous dielectric liquids</strong>	Wide utilization of nanomanipulation as a promising approach in microorganisms, nanoelectromechanical systems and assembly of nanostructures remarks the importance of nanostructures&rsquo; motion in electric fields. Here, we study the rotational dynamics of metallic and non-metallic nanowires (NWs) in a static uniform electric field in viscous dielectric liquids. For metallic NWs, it has been theoretically shown that the electric field-induced rotation is practically independent of the geometrical dimensions and electrical properties of NWs. Our experimental results for suspended silver (Ag) NWs in microscope oil are perfectly in agreement with this model. However, in the case of TiO<sub>2</sub> NWs, as an example of non-metallic NWs, we surprisingly observe the exactly same electromechanical torque as metallic Ag NWs under the same experimental conditions. This is mainly explained by NWs&rsquo; high aspect-ratio which allows to ignore the non-axial component of the electric field inside the NWs. Therefore, all high-aspect-ratio metallic Ag and non-metallic TiO<sub>2</sub> NWs demonstrate an identical rotational speed in the same dielectric liquid and electric field. This result can be used for controllable alignment or synchronous rotation of an ensemble of different type of NWs for hybrid and advanced devices.
784	<strong>CNTs-H2O Nanofluid Thin Film Flow over a Nonlinear Extending Disc</strong>	The aim of this research is the improvement towards the consumption of energy in the field of engineering and industry. The efforts have been paid to the enhancement of heat transmission and cooling process through a nanofluid coating of a nonlinear stretching disc. The combination of Water (H2O) and multiple walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) / single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) have been used as a nanofluid.  The spreading of a thin nano-layer with variable thickness over a nonlinear and radially stretching surface has been considered. The estimated results of the problem have been accomplished using the optimal approach. The important physical parameters of skin friction and Nusselt number have been calculated and discussed. The other embedding parameters like generalized magnetic parameter, Prantl number, nanofluid volume fraction and Eckert number have been intended and discussed.
785	Ultraviolet Relaxation Dynamics in Uracil: Time-resolved Photoion Yield Studies Using a Laser-based Thermal Desorption Source	Wavelength-dependent measurements of the RNA base uracil, undertaken with nanosecond ultraviolet laser pulses, have previously identified a fragment at m/z = 84 (corresponding to the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sup>+</sup> ion) at excitation wavelengths {less than or equal to}232 nm. This has been interpreted as a possible signature of a theoretically predicted ultrafast ring-opening occurring on a neutral excited state potential energy surface. To further investigate the dynamics of this mechanism, and also the non-adiabatic dynamics operating more generally in uracil, we have used a newly-built ultra-high vacuum spectrometer incorporating a laser-based thermal desorption source to perform time-resolved ion-yield measurements at pump wavelengths of 267 nm, 220 nm and 200 nm. We also report complementary data obtained for the related species 2-thiouracil following 267 nm excitation. Where direct comparisons can be made (267 nm), our findings are in good agreement with previously reported measurements conducted on these systems using cold molecular beams, demonstrating that the role of initial internal energy on the excited state dynamics is negligible. Our 220 nm and 200 nm data also represent the first reported ultrafast study of uracil at pump wavelengths &lt;250 nm, revealing extremely rapid (&lt;200 fs) relaxation of the bright S<sub>3</sub>(<sup>1</sup>&#x03C0;&#x03C0;*) state. These measurements do not, however, provide any evidence for the appearance of the m/z = 84 fragment within the first few hundred picoseconds following excitation. This key finding indicates that the detection of this specific species in previous nanosecond work is not directly related to an ultrafast ring opening process. An alternative excited state process, operating on a more extended timescale, remains an open possibility.
786	In-doped Sb nanowires self-assembled by MOCVD for high speed phase change memories	We investigated the Phase Change Memory (PCM) behavior of In-doped Sb nanowires (NWs) with diameters of about 20 nm, which were self-assembled by Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) via the vapor-liquid-solid mechanism, catalyzed by Au nanoparticles. The PCM behavior of the NWs was proved, and it was shown to have low reset power (~ 400 &mu;W) and energy (~ 10 pJ) consumption, as well as faster switching capabilities with respect to standard Ge-Sb-Te based devices. In particular, reversible set and reset switches by voltage pulses as short as 25 ns were demonstrated. The obtained results are useful for understanding the effects of downscaling in PCM devices and for the exploration of innovative PCM architectures and materials.
787	<strong>Numerical Study of MHD Nanofluid Natural Convection and Aspect Ratio in a Baffled U-shaped Enclosure </strong>	In this study, nanofluid natural convection and cavity aspect ratio in a baffled U-shaped enclosure in present of magnetic field is investigated. Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is used to study present problems. KKL (Koo-Kleinstreuer-Li) correlation, which considering the effect of Brownian motion on the nanofluid effective thermal conductivity, is applied to calculate the nanofluid effective thermal conductivity and viscosity. Effect of Rayleigh number, Hartmann number, nanoparticle volume fraction and aspect ratio on the fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics have been investigated. The results reveal that the average Nusselt number is an increasing function of the Rayleigh number and nanoparticle solid volume fraction regardless the cavity aspect ratio. The rate of heat transfer increases with increasing the aspect ratio. Moreover, it can be found that the heat transfer rate is suppressed by magnetic field.
788	<strong>MHD three dimensional boundary layer flow and heat transfer of Cu- and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>&ndash;water nanofluids over an exponentially stretching sheet with convective heat and mass transfer boundary conditions</strong>	Present article analyze the magnetohydrodynamic three dimensional flow comprising Cu and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>water based nanofluids. The effects of heat and mass transfer with the effects of nanoparticles are carried out in the presence of thermal radiation, viscous dissipation, and convective heat and mass transfer boundary conditions. By applying the appropriate similarity transformations the governing partial differential equations of velocity, temperature and nanoparticle volume fraction are reduce to a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. An optimal homotopy analysis method (OHAM) is applied to evaluate the convergent power series solutions. The influences of pertinent parameters on the dimensionless velocity, temperature and nanoparticle volume fraction are depicted through graphs. Calculations of Nusselt number, skin friction coefficients and the local Sherwood number are evaluated through tables. An excellent comparison also has been made with the previously published literature.
789	<strong>The Dependence of Hot-Electron Temperature and Hot-Phonon Lifetime on Electric Field in GaN-based Heterostructures </strong>	Experimental and analytical investigations of two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel in Al<sub>0.3</sub>Ga<sub>0.7</sub>N/AlN/GaN heterostructures with and without <em>in situ</em> Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> surface passivation layer were carried out at high electric fields using nanosecond pulsed I-V measurements. The longitudinal optical (LO)-phonon lifetime was estimated from the measured and calculated dependence of hot-electron temperature on supplied electric power. The hot-electron temperatures in these heterostructures with and without <em>in situ</em> Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> surface passivation layer were calculated as 496 K and 515 K at 175 kV/cm, respectively. Dependence of hot-phonon lifetimes on the applied electric field was compared and discussed for the investigated samples. It was found that the hot-phonon lifetime changes from 2.3 to 5.4 fs with the increasing electric field.
790	<strong>The dependence of Schottky (I&#x2012;V) characteristics on the metal probe size in nano metal&#x2012;semiconductor contacts</strong>	We have studied the dependence of Schottky (I&#x2012;V) characteristics on the metal contact size in nanoscale metal&#x2012;semiconductor (M&#x2012;S) junctions. Using special nano&#x2012;probes in conductive atomic force microscope, we have shown that the Schottky (I&#x2012;V) characteristic of M&#x2012;S junction depends strongly on the metal contact size, rather than the semiconductor bulk properties as in the planar microscale M&#x2012;S junctions. The theoretical calculations from our model show good agreement with the experimental (I&#x2012;V) data for a wide range of nano&#x2012;probe sizes. Our results indicate the strong correlation between electric field at the M&#x2012;S interface and the Schottky rectification behavior. The calculated (I&#x2012;V) data show a smooth transition from the reverse rectification behavior to the normal rectification behavior as the nano&#x2012;probe radius increases from sub-10 nm to 100 nm. Our results clearly demonstrate the effect of metal contact size in nano Schottky diodes, which would help in designing a new type of nano-devices at sub-10 nm scale.
791	Development of a tomographic Mueller-matrix scatterometer for nanostructure metrology	In this paper, we describe the development of a novel instrument, tentatively called tomographic Mueller-matrix scatterometer (TMS), which enables to illuminate sequentially a sample by a plane wave with varying illumination directions, and to record, for each illumination, the polarized scattered-field along various directions of observation in the form of scattering Mueller matrices. The incidence angle is varied from 0{degree sign} to 65.6{degree sign} with the rotation of a flat mirror that changes the position of the focal point of a light beam on the back focal plane of a high numerical aperture objective lens. The scattering Mueller matrices are collected over a wide range of scattering angles (0{degree sign}~67{degree sign}) and azimuthal angles (0{degree sign}~360{degree sign}). The developed instrument was then applied for the measurement of nanostructures in combination with an inverse scattering problem solving technique. The experiment performed on a periodic nanostructure preliminarily demonstrates the performance of TMS as well as its potential in nanostructure metrology. It is expected that the TMS would be a powerful tool for characterizing the polarized scattered-field distributions and measuring nanostructures in nanomanufacturing.
792	The nitrogen acceptor in 2H-polytype synthetic MoS2 assessed by multifrequency electron spin resonance	Electron spin resonance (ESR) study on 2H-polytype synthetic MoS2had revealed the N acceptor dopants as being characterized by a spectrum of axial symmetry [g&#x2225; = 2.032(2); g&#xF05E;= 2.270(2)], typical for a hole-type center in MoS2. The N impurities substitute for S sites, with density of ~2.3 x 1017 cm-3, which accounts for the overall p-type doping. Observed for the applied magnetic field directed along the c-axis, the signal consists of a 14N primary hyperfine triplet of splitting constant A&#x2225; = 14.7 {plus minus} 0.2 G superimposed on acorrelated Gaussiansingle central line (CL) of peak-to-peak width&#x0394;Bpp = 15.3 {plus minus} 0.5 G, the latter making up only ~26% of the total signal intensity.Current ESR signal saturation studiesindicatea N acceptor spin-lattice relaxation time T1(4.2 K)&#x2248; 3 x 10-4s, notably different from the much smallerAs acceptor'sT1in geological MoS2. Concerning the thermal stability of the dopant, the N acceptoris found to be drastically passivated when exposed to H2at ~500 {degree sign}C. Yet, subsequent reactivation attempts in vacuum at temperatures up to 740 {degree sign}C appear unsuccessful, urginggreat caution with conventional forming gas treatments at T&#x2273;500{degree sign}C. Combination of careful K- and Q-band ESR monitoring of the T-dependent signal intensity resulted in the consolidation of the N dopant as a shallow acceptor of activation energy Ea = 45 {plus minus} 7 meV. The total of the results establish N as a promising candidate for stable covalently bonded p-type doping of MoS2 layers intended for application in novel nanoelectronic devices.

794	Comparative optimization of squeezing flow through entropy generation accounting five different types of nanoparticles	The main objective of this article is to analyze the comparative study of five water base nanofluids. Nanofluids are comprises of Titanium oxide or Titania (<em>TiO</em>2), Aluminum oxide or Alumina (<em>AL</em>2<em>O</em>3), Copper oxide (<em>CuO</em>), Copper (<em>Cu</em>) and Silver (<em>Ag</em>) and water (<em>H</em>2<em>O</em>). Consider flow is unsteady between two sheets. Upper sheet squeezing towards lower sheet and lower sheet is porous and stretchable. Moreover thermal radiation, applied magnetic field, viscous dissipation and joule heating effects are accounted. Entropy generation effect is also evaluated. Second law of thermodynamics is implemented for the entropy generation. PDE's are transformed to ODE's by transformations procedure. ODE's system is numerically solved by shooting technique. Influences of various flow parameters on velocity, temperature, entropy generation and Began number is examined in graphs. Numerical results for skin friction and Nusselt number is tabulated. The obtained results show that velocity decays for larger values of magnetic parameter and porosity while it enhanced through squeezing parameter. Temperature is increasing function of Eckert number, magnetic parameter, squeezing parameter and nanoparticles volume fraction. Entropy generation is increased with thermal radiation, Prandtl number, volume fraction and Eckert number.
795	Wafer-Scale Fabrication of CMOS-compatible, High Aspect Ratio Encapsulated Nanochannels	Nanochannels are of great interest in nanofluidics for DNA sequencing, chromatography and drug delivery. However, typical nanochannel fabrication methods are ill-suited for full integration with other microfabricated components or devices. Here, we demonstrate nanochannels with an aspect ratio (length to cross-sectional dimension) greater than 400,000-where the width (35-40 nm) and height (140-150 nm) of the channels are sufficiently small to elongate macromolecules-at channel lengths on the order of mm. We fabricate these channels with a CMOS-compatible tool set, allowing for the batch fabrication of a multitude of channels and with the further potential of full integration with solid-state electronic and photonic devices on the same wafer. Last, we demonstrate the versatility of our nanochannel fabrication platform by loading the channels with six different liquids and verify that the fluid flow dynamics for each liquid can be well-estimated with Washburn's equation.
796	Exploring Fractality of Microcrystalline Diamond Films	Diamond is renowned as a material with superlative physical qualities, most of which originate from the strong covalent bonding between its atoms. The possibility to deposit polycrystalline diamond films via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods on large areas and on a large variety of substrates is posing numerous scientific challenges but also enables relevant industrial applications. Especially for small grain sizes, the grain&rsquo;s misorientation and consequently the atomic structure of grain boundaries play a significant role on transport properties and mechanical properties. Hence, the size and shape of the crystallites of poly- and nanocrystalline diamond films are one important key to optimize film properties for their specific applications. Fractal theory helps to find and define order in systems where disorder seems to prevail. Therefore, we apply fractal geometry analysis to characterize the grain morphology and surface topology of CVD grown diamond films.
797	Superhydrophobic, Carbon-Infiltrated Carbon Nanotubes on Si and 316L Stainless Steel with Tunable Geometry	Use of carbon nanotubes to create superhydrophobic coatings has been considered due to their ability to offer a relatively uniform nanostructure.  However, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) may be considered delicate with a typical diameter of tens of nanometers for a multi-walled CNT; as-grown carbon nanotubes often require the addition of a thin-film hydrophobic coating to render them superhydrophobic.  Furthermore, fine control over the diameter of the as-grown CNTs, or overall nanostructure is difficult. This work demonstrates the utility of using carbon infiltration to layer amorphous carbon on multi-walled nanotubes to improve structural integrity and achieve superhydrophobic behavior with tunable geometry.  These carbon-infiltrated carbon nanotube (CICNT) surfaces exhibit an increased number of contact points between neighboring tubes, resulting in a composite structure with improved mechanical stability.  Additionally, the native surface can be rendered superhydrophobic with a vacuum pyrolysis treatment, with contact angles as high as 160&deg; and contact angle hysteresis on the order of 1&deg;.  CICNT diameter, static contact angle, sliding angle, and contact angle hysteresis were examined for varying levels of carbon-infiltration to determine the effect of infiltration on superhydrophobicity.  The same superhydrophobic behavior and tunable geometry was also observed with CICNTs grown directly on stainless steel without an additional catalyst layer.  The ability to tune the geometry while maintaining superhydrophobic behavior offers significant potential in condensation heat transfer, anti-icing, microfluidics, anti-microbial surfaces and other bio-applications where control over the nanostructure is beneficial.
798	Comparative catalytic and bacteriostatic properties of silver nanoparticles biosynthesized using three kind of polysaccharide	Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were biosynthesized using konjac glucomannan (KGM), &#x03BA;-carrageenan (CRG) and inulin as reducing and capping agent through one spot method. The structure and morphology of Ag NPs were investigated with UV-visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and X-Ray diffraction (XRD). The catalysis and antibacterial properties were further comparative investigated. The results illustrated that Ag NPs were fabricated affected by the incubation temperature and polysaccharide category. CRG displayed a stronger reduction of Ag+ than KGM, and the lowest was inulin. Higher incubation temperature promoted the reduction of Ag NPs. As for Ag100 NPs, the kapp of CRG, inulin and KGM based Ag NPs were 5.80&#x00D7;10-2 s 1, 2.14&#x00D7;10-2 s 1, and 2.16&#x00D7;10-2 s 1 respectively. The further bacteriostatic test displayed excellent antimicrobial activity of Ag NPs for Escherichia coli and Staphyloccocus aureus. The results convinced that natural polysaccharide could be green and effective reducing and stabilizing agent for Ag NPs biosynthesis. Their excellent antibacterial and catalytic properties may provide good choice in medical, food and biological field.
799	Efficiency enhancement of flexible OLEDs by using nano-corrugated substrates and conformal Ag transparent anodes	In flexible OLEDs (FOLEDs), the traditional ITO anode has disadvantages such as refractive-index mismatches among substrate and other functional layers, leads to light loss of nearly 80%, meanwhile, the brittle nature and lack in raw material of ITO anode hinder its further applications. We investigated an efficient FOLED using a semi-transparent silver (Ag) anode, whereas the whole device was built on a nano-corrugated flexible polycarbonate (PC) substrate prepared by thermal nanoimprint lithography. The corrugations were well preserved on each layer of the device, both the micro-cavity effect and surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes of light loss were effectively suppressed. As a result, the current efficiency of the FOLED using a conformal corrugated Ag anode enhanced by 100% compared with a planar Ag anode device, and enhanced by 13% with conventional ITO device. In addition, owing to the quasi-periodical arrangements of the corrugations, the device achieved broad spectra and Lambertian angular emission. The Ag anode significantly improved the bending properties of the OLED as compared to the conventional ITO device, leading to a longer lifetime in practical use. The proposed manufacturing strategy will be useful for fabricating nano corrugations on plastic substrate of FOLED in a cost-effective and convenient manner.
800	Coupling between the localized plasmon resonance excitation and the longitudinal magneto-optical Kerr effect in Au/Co/Au plasmonic nanostructures	We report the observation and enhancement of the longitudinal magneto-optical Kerr effect in anisotropic Au/Co/Au plasmonic nanostructures. We fabricated Au/Co/Au rectangular patch arrays with different short axis lengths varied from 125 to 245 nm. When linearly polarized light with wavelength of 785 nm was illuminated to the structure, local-mode surface plasmons were resonantly excited in the structure with 200 nm length. In this condition, significant enhancement of the magnitude of the complex Kerr rotation was observed. Our results suggest that the local mode plasmon resonance couples with and enhances the longitudinal magneto-optical Kerr effect.
801	<strong>Huge Magnetoresistance in p-type Silicon Nanowires</strong>	Silicon nanowires (SiNWs) were formed by metal &ndash;assisted chemical etching of crystalline silicon, in a mixture of aqueous HF and AgNO<sub>3</sub> chemical solutions. The magnetic field effects on the current of Ag/SiNWs/Si/Al structures have been studied. Magnetoresistance (MR) measurements, at room temperature, revealed positive and negative MR depending on the etching time and the applied voltage. Huge positive MR of about 1200 % has been observed at low field. The negative MR  is attributed to the weak localization (WL) effect, while the positive one is related to the ohmic regime, where holes control the current. The MR effect depends on the applied voltage and the length of the SiNWs. The huge MR effect in SiNWs can be exploited in magnetic-field sensor devices.
802	Effect of Addition of SiC and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> Refractories on Kapitza Resistance of Antimonide-Telluride	Invoking Effective Media Percolation theory (EMPT), Hasselaman and Johnson effective media theory (EMT), and Nan and Birringer EMT, the effect of addition of SiC and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>nanoparticles on Kapitza resistance (<em>R<sub>Bd</sub></em>) of Ni<sub>0.05</sub>Mo<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>5.4</sub>Te<sub>1.6</sub> was investigated. Pore size and their volume distribution, and surface area were characterized using BET technique to correlate pore effect and surface area on <em>R<sub>Bd</sub></em>. Bounds for effective thermal conductivity were determined using Lipton&ndash;Vernescu model. Variation of thermal conductance with respect to temperature was studied and compared with the results of other materials. According to EMPT, <em>R<sub>Bd</sub></em> in Ni<sub>0.05</sub>Mo<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>5.4</sub>Te<sub>1.6</sub>/SiC composites ranged from 3.84 &times; 10<sup>-7</sup> to 5.42 &times; 10<sup>-7</sup> m<sup>2</sup>KW<sup>&ndash;1 </sup>and 3.36 to 3.86 m<sup>2</sup>KW<sup>&ndash;1 </sup>for Ni<sub>0.05</sub>Mo<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>5.4</sub>Te<sub>1.6</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composites. Kapitza radius (<em>a<sub>K</sub></em>) for SiC samples was ranged between 2.01 - 2.84 &mu;m; for Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> samples it was 1.86 &mu;m. Hasselman-Johnson model gave <em>R<sub>Bd</sub></em> values, 55%, 51%, and 8% more than what EMPT is predicting, but of the same order and higher <em>a<sub>K</sub></em> values for SiC samples and lowest for Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> samples. Nan-Birringer model yielded large <em>a<sub>K</sub></em> of 7.25 &mu;m and <em>R<sub>Bd</sub></em> ~ 1.4 &times; 10<sup>&ndash;6  </sup>m<sup>2</sup>KW<sup>&ndash;1 </sup>for Ni<sub>0.05</sub>Mo<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>5.4</sub>Te<sub>1.6</sub>/SiC. So obtained parameters are reasonable estimates. Mechanical properties were studied using micro&ndash;indentation technique and their effect on effective thermal properties was ascertained. Addition of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles aided in enhancing mechanical properties of bulk material.
803	Ag nanoparticles surface plasmon enhanced electroluminescence from n-ZnO/InAlN/p-GaN heterojunction light-emitting diodes	Ag nanoparticles (NPs) were used to demonstrate the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) enhanced electroluminescence from n-ZnO/InAlN/p-GaN heterojunction light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Ag NPs were hydrothermally synthesized with an average diameter as 30 nm that was well matched to the predicted optimal result of the finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) calculation. An 1.7-fold and 1.4-fold enhancement in photoluminescence intensity were measured by top excitation of Ag NPs coupled with GaN and ZnO, respectively. An 1.2-fold enhancement in electroluminescence intensity was obtained by lighting the n-ZnO/InAlN/p-GaN heterojunction LEDs coupled with Ag NPs.
804	<strong>The role of convection in gas and liquid phases at droplet evaporation</strong>	The article presents the measuring results of droplet velocity and temperature fields using non-contact optical methods: Particle Image Velocity (PIV), Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) and Thermal imager. The analysis of experimental data has shown that in the initial period of water drop evaporation, the predominant role in the heat exchange is played by the thermal Marangoni convection. However, for an aqueous salt solution, in spite of the strong influence of the surfactant, the dominant role passes to the solutal Marangoni convection (<em>Ma<sub>C</sub></em>). The results of the analysis contained in this article can be used to describe not only drops and thin films of solutions, including nano- and micro-coatings, but drops falling on the wall. This is due to the fact that in the first seconds after the drop falling, convection and heat transfer in the liquid are maximum. Under such conditions it is important to realize an accurate numerical simulation to assess the degree of the wall cooling and to calculate the non-stationary evaporation. When simulating heat transfer, it is incorrect to neglect free convection in gas or liquid due to their strong nonlinear influence on each other. The heat exchange in the drop is extremely conservative to convection in the liquid (the Peclet number <em>Pe</em> = 100 and the Nusselt number <em>Nu</em> = 4).
805	Force-detected high-frequency electron spin resonance spectroscopy of fast-relaxing spin systems using magnet-mounted SiNx nanomembrane	While force-detected electron spin resonance (ESR) using microcantilever can achieve high spinssensitivity, it has several technical and principle problems when used as a spectroscopic technique. Insthis study, we report a conceptually novel broadband high-frequency ESR spectroscopic technique.sIn contrast to the ordinary force-detected ESR technique, which detects the magnetization changesdue to the saturation effect, this method measures the increase in temperature in the process ofsspin relaxation by using the temperature-dependent magnetization. To demonstrate its principle,swe developed a silicon nitride nanomembrane-based force-detected ESR spectrometer, which can besstably operated even at high magnetic elds. Test measurements were performed for samples withsdifferent spin relaxation times. We succeeded in obtaining a seamless ESR spectrum in magneticselds of 15 T and frequencies of 636 GHz without signicant spectral distortion. A high spinssensitivity of 10^12 spins/G was obtained, which was independent of the spin relaxation time. Thesesresults show that this technique can be used as a practical method in research elds where thesHFESR technique is applicable.
806	Suppression of charge ordering and stabilization of ferromagnetism in Pr0.5Sr0.5MnO3 Nanomanganite	Particle size effects on nanosized half-doped Pr0.5Sr0.5MnO3 (PSMO) manganite has been investigated by ac-susceptibility, electronic- transport and dc- magnetic measurements. We have found ground state low temperature charge-ordering is suppressed and ferro-antiferromagnetic transition is smeared out in PSMO nanoparticles. Ac-susceptibility and dc-magnetic measurements exhibit ferromagnetic nature in low temperature regime with a signature of metastable magnetic state. Temperature dependent resistivity under various external magnetic fields confirms the suppression of charge ordering state and exhibit metallic-insulator transition around 160 K. We report maximum 60% magneto resistance is estimated for lowest particle size around transition temperature. Appearance of ferromagnetism and metallicity in PSMO nano manganite has been explained in limelight of enhanced surface disorder.
807	<strong><strong>Spatial potential fluctuation at CdSe nanowire/Au Schottky junctions</strong></strong>	Understanding the electrical transport mechanism across the interface of metal/semiconductor nanostructure is of significant importance for the fabrication of high performance nano&ndash;electric and nano&ndash;optoelectric devices. In this paper, we have fabricated Schottky junctions based on single CdSe nanowires (NWs), in which Au was used as the Schottky contact, and In/Au was used as the Ohmic contact with CdSe NW. The Schottky junctions exhibit a clear rectification behavior. At room temperature, the turn&ndash;on voltage of a typical Schottky junction is about 0.85 V, and the rectification ratio is about 1&times;10<sup>4</sup>. The temperature&ndash;dependent electrical transport characteristics of typical CdSe NW/Au Schottky junctions were characterized and analyzed. The ideality factor decreases and the zero&ndash;bias barrier height increases monotonously with an increase in temperature from 287 to 402 K. We attributed the temperature&ndash;dependent electrical transport characteristics to the barrier height inhomogeneity at the CdSe NW/Au interface. The electrical transport characteristics have been analyzed quantitatively with a spatial potential fluctuation model, in which the Schottky barrier height obeys the Gaussian distribution. The standard deviation of the barrier height distribution is up to 13.6% of the zero&ndash;bias mean barrier height, which indicates large inhomogeneity at the CdSe NW/Au interface.
808	Suppression of higher diffraction orders in the extreme ultraviolet range by a reflective quasi-random square nano-pillar array	Higher diffraction orders of a grating introduce so-called harmonics contamination that leads to ambiguity in the spectral data. They are also present in "monochromatic" output beams processed by grating monochromators at synchrotron radiation facilities, making calibration results of optical elements and detectors imprecise. The paper describes a new design of a reflective quasi-random square nano-pillar array grating to reduce the amount of data of the grating relief pattern that is ten centimeters in size and suppresses higher diffraction orders in the extreme ultraviolet range. In addition, a laboratory-scale grating monochromator equipped with the grating has been developed to test its spectroscopy characteristics in the grazing incident mode. The results illustrate that it can suppress higher diffraction orders and maintain the spectrum resolution power as an ordinary grating in the grazing incident mode. The grating has great potential in harmonics suppression in the field of synchrotron radiation, spectral diagnostics of plasma, and astrophysics.
809	<strong>Learning mechanisms in memristor networks based on GaN nanomembranes </strong>	We demonstrate experimentally that single crystalline GaN nanomembranes arranged in simple networks exhibit learning mechanisms such as habituation and dishabituation followed by storage of the response to a certain electrical stimulus. These artificial learning mechanisms are analogous to non-associative learning processes which are identical in simple animals and human beings. We found that the learning time depends on the number of GaN membranes in parallel, this parameter decreasing with 30% when three memristors are connected in parallel compared to the learning time of a single memristor. Moreover, an increased number of parallel memristors reduces the eventual asymmetry in the temporal response of the circuit at positive and negative step voltages.
810	<strong>Ni/Graphitic Carbon Core-Shell Nanostructured based Light Weight Elastomeric Composites for Ku-Band Microwave Absorbing Applications </strong>	Graphitic carbon coated Ni metal core nanoparticles are synthesized using controlled thermal treatment of Ni-hydroxide in aniline-formaldehyde copolymer matrix under N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The structural and microstructural studies substantiate the formation of graphitic shell on metallic nickel core. The 850&deg;C heat treated core-shell structured material is ferromagnetic in nature with high saturation magnetization. The blocking temperature is above the room temperature. The sample with the highest value of magnetic moment is impregnated in rubber matrix to prepare composite samples with core-shell nanomaterials for different weight fractions. The sample with 70 wt% Ni/Graphitic carbon core-shell in elastomeric rubber matrix showed the optimal microwave absorption at fairly low thickness of ~ 1mm. This is attributed to the optimized combination of the effective impedance matching and interfacial polarization losses. Further increase in Ni/Graphitic carbon filler material resulted into reduced microwave absorption due to greater mismatch of impedance as compared to the desired free space impedance of ~377&Omega;. Thus, the optimized composite material is of great potential for microwave absorption in Ku band.
811	2D nanoporous membrane for cation removal from water II. Maximum desalination by iron flocculation	In our previous work [J. Chem. Phys. 148, 222804 (2018)] we have studied the effectiveness of nanoporous graphene and molybdenum disulfide to remove cations with distinct valences from water. Inspired by that work, we now employ Molecular Dynamics simulations of a mixture of 1:1 and 3:1 salts. We explore the effect of adding ferric chloride as a flocculant to an aqueous sodium chloride solution. The NaCl rejection by the nanomembranes is enhanced due to the addition of the multivalent cation from ~70% to 100%. Our findings indicate that the mechanism behind this effect is the ionic clustering due to the presence of the multivalent ion combined with the dielectric discontinuity at the nanopore. This result shows that a simple flocculant can maximize the water desalination by nanopores.
812	<strong>Simultaneous dispersive and covalent monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> cluster heterostructures: Insights into their enhanced photocatalytic activity</strong>	Tuning electron transfer at interface, largely depending upon interfacial interaction, is paramount to rationally designing nanoscale heterostructures with desirable performance for future electronics, optoelectronics, and solar energy conversion. Here, we explore the interfacial interaction between monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub> cluster to elucidate the mechanism of the enhanced photocatalytic activity of their hybrids. It is firstly revealed that both dispersive (van der Waals forces) and covalent interactions can simultaneously exist in the monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> cluster heterostructures, which depends on their relative orientations. The Ti-S and O=S bonds in covalently bonded heterostructures and flat bands in noncovalent heterostructures lead to an effective separation of photoexcited charge carriers between two constituents, therefore enhanced photocatalytic activity. The small band gap enables the MoS<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> cluster heterostructures having strong optical absorption in the whole visible light. Moreover, the Mo and S atoms at basal plane, which are catalytically inert, turn into catalytic active sites, making the monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> to be a highly active co-catalyst. These findings disclose the elusive microscopic mechanism behind the enhanced photocatalytic activity of MoS<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2 </sub>hybrids, and provide a systematic step towards a better understanding of interfacial interaction in layered MoS<sub>2</sub>-based heterostructures.
813	<strong>Influence of Vacancy Defect Concentration on the Combustion of Reactive Ni/Al Nanolaminates</strong>	Self-propagating reactions in Ni/Al nanolaminates have been widely studied for their high combustion temperatures surpassing 1900 K and rapid combustion wave speeds exceeding 10 m/s.  These combustion characteristics have motivated unique industrial applications, such as soldering of electrical components, and possible military applications.  Unfortunately, there is a limited understanding of the effect of lattice defects on combustion characteristics. This work explores the effect of vacancy concentration on the combustion rate and peak temperature of reactive Ni/Al nanolaminates.  Increasing vacancy concentration increases both reaction rates and peak reaction temperatures.  For the reaction rate, vacancy concentration effects are shown to be interdependent with bilayer thickness, initial temperature and hydrostatic pressure.  The effects on reaction peak temperature are independent of these other system parameters.  A new method for mapping vacancy and composition profiles is presented to demonstrate the formation and migration of vacancies during the self-propagating reaction.
814	<em></em>Enhanced localized surface plasmon resonance by inter-band transitions in nanoshell structures	We theoretically study the interactions between the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and the inter-band transition (IBT) of a Au nanoshell structure based on Mie theory with the dielectric function of Drude-Lorentz mode. It shows that with changing the core radius of shell, the LSPR is modulated in the same regime with the IBT. As a result, the process of LSPR and IBT strongly interacts with each other. The two processes of LSPR and IBT couple and then split into new modes. Our results show that LSPR can be enhanced by the IBT. This enhancement is relevant to be applied to improve biosensor signal and advanced plasmonic applications.
815	A Nanosecond Pulsed Generator Based on Fast-Solid-State Switch fors Synchronous Discharge of Plasma Synthetic Jet Actuators	The plasma excited by the pulsed power generator is an efficient method for flow control. In this paper, a nanosecond pulsed generator based on a fast-solid-state switch is designed for producing synchronous discharges of paralleled plasma synthetic jet (PSJ) actuator. The generator produces high-voltage pulses by switching on and off the input DC voltages. The output voltage ranges from 0 to 20 kV with a rise time of 20 ns and a full width at half maximum of 200 ns. The repetition rate ranges from 1 Hz to 5.5 kHz. Furthermore, the pulsed generator is used to excite the paralleled PSJs in atmospheric air. The relative experimental results show that the nanosecond-pulse generator is able to sustain synchronous discharges of three PSJ actuators. The amplitude of the discharge current exceeds 90 A and the deposited energy per pulse reaches 45 mJ. Furthermore, a schlieren system is used to capture the evolution of the flow field of the PSJ actuator. The results show that with the excitation of the nanosecond pulse generator, the evolution of the three PSJ actuators has high synchronization. The time delay among the three PSJ actuators is 20 ns. In addition, the PSJ actuators can produce a jet with a maximum velocity of 60 m/s and a precursor wave with the velocity of 350 m/s.
816	Fractional rheology of muscle precursor cells	We propose a wavelet-based decomposition of creep fluctuation signals recorded from living muscle precursor cells that revisits the traditional computation of their power spectrum from FFT-based decomposition. This decomposition offers a higher sensitivity for detecting the occurrence of fractional fluctuations and for quantitatively estimating the power-law exponent &#x03B2; of this spectrum as a signature of the scaleinvariantsrheology of living cells. This new method has also the unprecedented advantage to provide a test of the validity of the commonly assumed "monofractal" self-similar (as compared to "multifractal" intermittent) nature of these fluctuations and hence to accredit the use of a single rheological exponent &#x03B1; = &#x03B2;/2. We report and discuss results obtained when applying this method to creep experiments performed with an AFM nanoindenter placed in contact with single myoblasts and myotubes, adherent on collagen coated coverslips, and in different culture conditions.
817	<strong>Analysis of magnetotransport properties and microstructure in current-perpendicular-to-plane pseudo spin-valves using Co<sub>2</sub>Fe(Ga<sub>0.5</sub>Ge<sub>0.5</sub>) Heusler alloy and Ag/Mg-Ti-O/Ag-based spacer</strong>	Current-perpendicular-to-plane giant magnetoresistance (CPP-MR) devices using Co<sub>2</sub>Fe(Ga<sub>0.5</sub>Ge<sub>0.5</sub>) Heusler alloy as ferromagnetic electrodes and Ag/Mg-Ti-O (MTO)/Ag tri-layer as a spacer were studied. Large voltage output of 16 mV with magnetoresistance ratio of 46% and resistance-area product <em>R</em><sub>p</sub><em>A</em> in the parallel magnetization state of approximately 200 m&Omega; &mu;m<sup>2</sup> are obtained. The microstructure characterization reveals that upon annealing at 550 &ordm;C, nanoscale Ag channels are formed penetrating the MTO layer, which are responsible for the large MR output. At room temperature, for all the devices, <em>R</em><sub>p</sub><em>A</em> decreases with increasing the bias voltage <em>V</em><sub>b</sub>, which is contradictory to the conventional CPP-GMR devices with current-confined-path (CCP) structure, in which the <em>R</em><sub>p</sub><em>A</em> decreases with increasing <em>V</em><sub>b</sub>. Such a <em>V</em><sub>b</sub> dependence of <em>R</em><sub>p</sub><em>A</em> is in accord with the temperature dependence of <em>R</em><sub>p</sub><em>A</em>. These results suggest that the magneto-transport channels comprise semiconducting current confined paths, bringing new perspectives for the design and engineering of CPP-MR devices with conductive oxides-based multilayer spacers.
818	Control of ion transport through a carbon nanotube by the pressure-driven water flow	Control of water and ion transport through nanochannels is not only important to biological activities but also useful for the design of nanofluidic devices. In this work, using molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically analyze the effect of ionic conditions such as ionic species and concentration, on the transport of water and ions through a carbon nanotube under the pressure difference. We find a linear relationship between the water flux and pressure difference for both of the monovalent and divalent salts, leading to similar linear behaviors for the ion flux. Interestingly, due to the blockage of trivalent cations at the channel entrance, the water flux shows an abnormal decreasing behavior with the increase of pressure difference, where the corresponding ion flux is close to zero. The translocation time of water and ions exhibit power law decreases with the pressure difference for both of the monovalent and divalent salts. Furthermore, due to the blockage of ions, the water flux decreases monotonously with the increase of salt concentration; while the ion flux has a maximum because of the competition between ion amount and blockage. Our results demonstrate that the ion transport can in a highly controllable fashion by the pressure-driven water flow, depending on the ionic conditions. The revealed new physical insights into the coupling transport of water and ions provide great implications in the design of novel nanofluidic devices.
819	FABRICATION OF SYMMETRIC AND ASYMMETRIC NANO/MICRO STRUCTURES USING MULTIPLE BEAM MODULATED INTERFERENCE LITHOGRAPHY TECHNIQUE FOR SURFACE MORPHOLOGICAL TEXTURE	A method for fabrication of symmetric nano/micro array patterned structure is demonstrated by the use of multi-beam modulated interference lithography (MBIL) technique. The generated periodic 1D, 2D and 3D micro/nano array structures are done using MATLAB. The obtained results show that the complexity of the pattern structures varies with the variation in position of beams and angle of incidence. The interference parameters such as wavelength, slit separation, distance between slit and screen influence in generation of periodic array pattern structures. The maximum intensity occurs at an angle of incidence 45 degree.sThe simulation shows that the variation in slit separation from 0.02 mm to 0.6 mm, beyond which only the constructive interference exist. So we conclude that lesser the slit separation which results in higher penetration of beam in the screen. The periodicity of the pattern exist in the range of 0.58. By tuning the input parameters, the periodicity, density and aspect ratio of the generated pattern can be controlled. The generated pattern structures are then fabricated over structure layered in Polymeric materials polyimide (PI) for &#x03BB;=1064 nm, slit separation d =0.6 mm and L= 0.005 m. The generated nano/micro structures on various substrates could be potentially utilized for the applications of Plasmonic Devices, MEMS, NEMS, Quantum Dots, Quantum wires, Functional surfaces for sensors and devices etc. We can also extend this techniques to generate complex symmetric and asymmetric structures.
820	Fabrication and characterization of transparent conducting reduced graphene oxide/Ag nanowires/ZnO:Ga composite thin films on flexible substrates	In recent years, flexible transparent conducting films (TCFs) have attracted considerable research interest because they are essential materials in flexible optoelectronic devices, which are still limited by the lack of suitable electrode materials. Some materials, including conducting polymers, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and metal nanowires, are considered to be possible alternatives for flexible TCFs. However, the resistivity of graphene films is high, and silver nanowire (AgNW) mesh films are easily oxidized, which limits their practical applications. In this study, a highly stable, transparent, and flexible composite electrode was developed using reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/AgNWs/Ga-doped zinc oxide (GZO) composite thin films. The rGO film was first spin coated on flexible substrates and used as an adhesion enhancement layer. The AgNWs, which were used as a primary conductor, formed a random percolating network embedded between the rGO and GZO films. The GZO film was sputtered on the surface of the AgNWs and was used as a protective layer to prevent the oxidation of the AgNWs. The rGO/AgNWs/GZO composite thin film exhibited excellent electrical conductivity and superior stability to a monolayer or a bilayer TCF. The sheet resistance of the composite film slightly increased from 5.04 to 5.42&#x03A9;/&#x25A1; when exposed to the atmosphere for 30 days. The rGO/AgNWs/GZO composite film exhibited an optical transmittance of approximately 85% at a wavelength of 550 nm. A bending test was conducted for 600 cycles with a curvature radius of 1 cm, and the test results revealed that sheet resistance of the composite film varied by less than 10%. The developed rGO/AgNW/GZO transparent conducting thin films have potential for use in future flexible optoelectronic device applications.
821	Hydration mediated interfacial transitions on mixed hydrophobic/hydrophilic nanodroplet interfaces	Interfacial phase transitions are of fundamental importance for climate, industry and biological processes. In this work, we observe a hydration mediated surface transition in supercooled oil nanodroplets in aqueous solutions using second harmonic and sum frequency scattering techniques. Hexadecane nanodroplets dispersed in water freeze at a temperature ~ 15 {degree sign}C below the melting point of the bulk alkane liquid. Addition of a trimethylammonium bromide (CXTA+) type surfactant with chain length equal or longer to that of the alkane causes the bulk oil droplet freezing transition to be preceded by a structural interfacial transition that involves water, oil and the surfactant. Upon cooling, the water loses some of its orientational order with respect to the surface normal, presumably by forming more tightly bonded hydrogen bond network that are oriented more parallel to the oil interface. This is followed by the surfactant alkyl chains losing some of their flexibility, and this chain stretching induces alkyl chain ordering in the bulk of the alkane phase, which is then followed by the bulk transition occurring at a 3 {degree sign}C lower temperature. This behavior is reminiscent of surface freezing observed in planar tertiary alkane/surfactant/water systems but differs distinctively in that it appears to be induced by the interfacial water and requires only a very small amount of surfactant.
822	<strong>Spitzer shaped 1D ZnO nanostructures for enhancement of field electron emission behaviors</strong>	We observed enhanced field emission (FE) behavior for spitzer shaped 1D ZnO nanowires synthesized via hydrothermal approaches. The spitzer shaped and pointed tipped 1D ZnO nanowires of average diameter 120 nm and length ~5-6 &mu;m were randomly grown over the ITO coated glass substrate. The turn-on field (<em>E<sub>on</sub></em>) of 1.56 V/&micro;m required to draw current density of 10 &micro;A/cm<sup>2</sup> from spitzer shaped 1D ZnO nanowires is significantly lower than that of pristine and doped ZnO nanostructures, and MoS<sub>2</sub>@TiO<sub>2</sub> heterostructure based FE devices. The orthodoxy test performed confirms the feasibility of field enhancement factor (<em>&beta;<sub>FE</sub></em>) of 3924 for ZnO/ITO emitters. The enhancement in FE behavior can be attributed to the spitzer shaped nanotips, sharply pointed nanotips and individual dispersion of ZnO nanowires. The ZnO/ITO emitters exhibited considerably stable electron emission with current fluctuations of &plusmn; 13 %. Our investigations suggest that the spitzer shaped 1D ZnO nanowires holds the potentials for further improvement in electron emission and other functionalities after forming their tunable nano-hetero-architectures with metal or conducting materials.
823	Metrological large range magnetic force microscopy	A new metrological large range magnetic force microscope (Met. LR-MFM) with a measurement volume up to 25 mm x 25 mm x 5 mm has been built up. The instrument works in a scanning sample principle. A dual-stage design, which combines a highly dynamic piezo stage and a large range precision mechanical positioning stage (referred to as a nanomeasuring machine, NMM), has been applied for scanning samples along three axes. The dual-stage design enables both a large range MFM measurements and a high scanning speed. The NMM applies high precision nanometric laser interferometers and angular sensors for measuring all six degree-of-freedoms of the sample position in full compliance with the Abbe principle, offering excellent positioning and measurement accuracy at the nm level. Experimental results show that its position stability reaches 0.15 nm, 0.2 nm and 0.6 nm along the x-, y- and z-axes, respectively. A home-built atomic force microscopy (AFM) head is applied in the instrument. It utilizes the optical lever principle for measuring the bending and torsion of cantilevers. The AFM head is capable of measuring in the contact, intermittent- and non-contact AFM mode. Three different measurement strategies referred to as Topo&MFM, MFMXY and MFMZ, respectively, have been developed for MFM measurements. The Topo&MFM measures the topography profile of the surface in the intermittent-contact mode first, and then the tip is lifted with a given height for non-contact MFM measurements, which is similar to conventional MFMs. The MFMXY differs from the Topo&MFM such that it does not measure the topography profile of surfaces at the 2nd and successive lines, thus reducing the tip wear and saving measurement time. To account for the influence of the instrument drift particularly along the z-axis, a drift compensation mechanism is implemented in the measurement strategy. The measurement strategy MFMZ offers the capability for imaging the stray field in the XZ or YZ planes. A number of measurement examples on a multilayered thin film reference sample made of [Co(0.4nm)/Pt(0.9nm)]100 and on a patterned magnetic multilayer [Co(0.4nm)/Pt(0.9nm)]10 with stripes with 9.9 &#x03BC;m line width and 20 &#x03BC;m periodicity are demonstrated, indicating the excellent measurement performance of the developed instrument.
824	Competing growth of titanium nitrides and silicides in Ti thin films processed in expanding microwave plasma: Morphology and microstructural properties.	The diffusion of nitrogen into Ti silicides allows the performance of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) components to be improved. In this work, the thermochemical treatment is carried out in an expanding microwave plasma reactor using (Ar-33%N2-1%H2) gas mixtures. This process promotes the chemical reactions on the surface of the film. The diffusion of nitrogen into the film is improved by the reducing effect of NHx and/or H species towards passive layers such as oxides which form a barrier of diffusion in the surface layers during the process. The simultaneous formation of Ti nitrides and silicides at the surface and at the film-substrate interface, respectively gives rise to two competing processes which result in the growth of the Ti nitride phase at the expense of the Ti silicide phase at a critical temperature of 800{degree sign}C. This paper reports on a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of TiSi2 and TiN phases and the microstructural properties of films by means of X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction investigations. Square shaped crystals of TiN are identified on the top of round shaped crystals of TiSi2. The growth of the TiN phase at the expense of TiSi2 induces a catastrophic decrease of the intensity of the (040) diffraction line of TiSi2 and a huge increase of the (220) reflection line of TiN. The microstructural properties change during the process such as the formation of TiN crystals of nanometric size in the bulk of the TiSi2 phase as well as the migration of  free Si which epitaxially grows at the film-substrate interface have been evidenced by very detailed investigations for the first time. The results are related to the mechanism of formation of TiN from the reaction between TiSi2 and nitrogen.
825	Pulsed ionized mesh-like assembly of hybrid silica nanostructures with controlled resistivity	The adaption and inclusion of electrical technologies with various applications have motivated researchers to develop the most efficient and effective sensors, batteries and capacitors for safe, reliable and prolonged operations. However, miniaturization of sensors and practically associated with batteries and capacitors have driven them to employ nanofibers and nanotubes made of various material for reliable operations. Considering wide acceptance and available research for silicon material, nanofibers and nanoparticles made using silicon can be a great candidate for manufacturing of such sensors and electrical components. To employ nanofibers for those applications, understanding of its resistive characteristics can be crucial. In our study, we have manufactured hybrid silicon nanofibrous structure using novel approach of pico-second laser ablation and performed 4-point resistivity test to comprehend the change in its electrical behavior with variation in different laser parameters like frequency, power and scanning parameter of number of loops. Significant change in resistivity was observed with increase in all three laser parameters with remarkable topological differences for surface ablated with various laser and scanning parameters.
826	Effect of the dipolar coupling on the precessional magnetization switching in two dimensional arrays of single-domain nano-ellipses	Various spintronic devices use single-domain magnetic nanoparticles as unit cells. We have investigated interparticle dipole-dipole interactions in arrays of Permalloy single-domain nano-ellipses through micromagnetic simulations. In this study, we have varied not only the aspect ratio and the spacing between ellipses, but also the magnetization distribution and the 2D lattice type. When integrating the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with zero external magnetic field, we have obtained the equilibrium magnetic configurations for each array. For small values of the spacing between ellipses, they interact strongly, such that the shape anisotropy is locally modified by the distribution of the magnetization. Moreover, we have studied the effect of the dipolar coupling on the precessional magnetization reversal. The minimum field strength required to switch the magnetization depends on the magnetization distribution in a strongly interacting magnetic system. Thus, we have estimated the minimum spacing between particles in which single-domain nano-ellipses becomes a weakly interacting magnetic system.
827	<strong>Enhanced thermal stability of dielectric, energy storage and discharge efficiency in a structurally frustrated piezoelectric system: Erbium modified Na<sub>0.5</sub>Bi<sub>0.5</sub>TiO<sub>3</sub>-BaTiO<sub>3</sub></strong>	We have systematically investigated the effect of rare earth erbium (Er<sup>3+</sup>) substitution on the structural, ferroelectric, piezoelectric and dielectric behaviour of the morphotropic phase boundary lead-free piezoelectric 0.94Na<sub>0.5</sub>Bi<sub>0.5</sub>TiO<sub>3</sub>-0.06BaTiO<sub>3</sub> (NBT-6BT). We found that the system shows very remarkable improvement in the thermal stability of energy storage density, discharge efficiency and dielectric permittivity. Detailed structural studies confirmed that Er modification induces a great deal of structural frustration in the system due to complex interplay of competing lattice instabilities in the midst of  positional disorder inherent in non-ergodic relaxor ferroelectric state of NBT-6BT. Our results therefore suggest that the good thermal stability of the different functionalities is intimately associated with very sluggish variation in the correlation length of the polar nano regions with temperature in this structurally frustrated system.
828	<strong>Localized surface plasmons of supershape nanoparticle dimers </strong>	In this work, the all plasmonic bands of supershape nanoparticle dimers were investigated using finite difference time domain simulations. The localized surface plasmons of dimers were extracted from extinction spectra. The effects of different surrounding materials and dimer gaps were reported on dimer plasmons. The obtained results showed that there exist the multiple plasmonics modes in supershape nanoparticle dimers. The electric field distribution of supershape nanoparticle dimers were studied at resonance wavelength of dimer plasmons. We found that formation bonding modes in dimers can be related to creation hot spots in low dimer gap. This study can be a base for the characterization of multiple dimer plasmons in plasmonic devices for sensing applications.
829	<strong>Transverse structure of the wave function of field emission electron beam determined by intrinsic transverse energy</strong>	The average transverse energy of electron beams is one of the important factors that governs the transverse beam divergence and the intrinsic beam brightness. The transverse beam properties of the thermionic emission and photoemission have been extensively studied in the past to elucidate the intrinsic limitation by cathode materials and to develop high brightness cathodes. However, similar investigations for field emission beams are rare, despite the significance of the average transverse energy of the field emission beam on the virtual source size, hence on the transverse spatial coherence. The present study aims at elucidating the impact of the intrinsic average transverse energy of field emission beams on the transverse structure of the wave function. For this purpose, we calculated the wave function of field emission electrons including the transverse motion of the electrons by taking into account the restriction imposed by Fermi sphere of electrons in metals. We obtained a Gaussian-beam-type solution that exhibits a minimum transverse width at the cathode surface as determined by the average transverse energy, and propagates with limited transverse spread for the first few nanometers. Some implications of the obtained solution in practical situations are discussed.
830	<strong>On conductivity in 2D molecular <em>&pi;</em>-stack with an outlook at charge transport in DNA solid state devices</strong>	Transport in naphthalene &pi;-stack system can exhibit switching behavior due to variation in its redox state. We study this phenomenon in molecular p-stack with an outlook on insight into charge transport in DNA solid state devices (DNAssd). Model molecular p-stack was based on naphthalene tetracarboxyl diimide (NTCDI) structure, which was assembled by molecular layer epitaxy (MLE) method. MLE method enables controllable growth of two-dimensional organic frameworks, which features ordered <em>&pi;</em>-stacked arrays of aromatic molecules. These molecular stacks are grown in <em>in-plane</em> direction in respect to surface and covalently bonded to inorganic semiconducting substrate. In this system the reduced NTCDI-acceptors form redox polarons, in which the charge is shared over several molecules within p-stack. We study an experimental conditions required to sustain efficient transport in this redox-capable NTCDI molecular p-stack. The transport in this redox-active system follows behavior of polarons, which occurs below HOMO-LUMO gap in molecular system, for which Ln <em>I</em> ~ <em>-E</em><sup>-2/3</sup>. We also study the case of redox blockade for NTCDI molecular p-stack.  We demonstrated that the same model (Ln <em>I</em> ~ <em>-E</em><sup>-2/3</sup>) is applicable for transport through DNA molecule, which was positioned between nano-electrodes. Study of transport in molecular &pi;-stack enables to elucidate phenomenon of conductivity switching, which may responsible for discrepancy between different transport experiments with DNA solid state devices (DNAssd). We propose a generalized efficient medium approach to describe the redox polaron transport in molecular stack based on a fully compensated semiconductor model. Presented model requires future experimental and theoretical approval.
831	<strong>Improvement in Piezoelectric Performance of a ZnO Nanogenerator by modulating interfaces engineering of CuO-ZnO heterojunction</strong>	In this paper, we demonstrate a approach of enhancing output performance of nanogenerators by modulating interfaces engineering of ZnO-CuO nano-heterojucnction. By properly modulating the preparation technology sequence of ZnO-CuO PN junctions, excessive electrons in ZnO can be highly suppressed. Using this approach, we obtained an output current up to ~1200 nA measured under the same compressive force of ~1kgf, which is a 25-fold higher output current, compared with the NG based on pure ZnO NWs. The corresponding working mechanisms was also discussed in this paper by using a interface energy band theory. This work may provide a potential approach to boost the piezoelectric performance of ZnO-CuO PN junctions NGs.
832	Nanometer-scale bioimaging via tunable terahertz plasmons	A nanometer-scale structured illumination microscopy (SIM) scheme via tunable plasmons is proposed. The sample is located on a semiconductor heterostructure and terahertz plasmons generated by a current-driven instability illuminate the sample.  Full coverage of the spatial frequency regime is obtained by tuning the plasmons through the control on  gate voltage. Hence, it is possible to reconstruct an image with a resolution up to two orders of magnitude beyond the diffraction limit. Due to the linear nature of the technique, only a weak illumination signal is required, therefore which minimizes the likelihood of sample damage and has potential application in bioimaging.
833	<strong>Enhancing thermoelectric performance in p-type ZrCoSb based </strong><strong>half-Heusler alloys employing nanostructuring and compositional modulation</strong>	Despite half-Heusler (HH) alloys being potentially considered for thermoelectric (TE) based power generation applications owing to their high thermal stability, good mechanical properties and enhanced power factor, their high thermal conductivity has remained a major impediment for further improvement in their thermoelectric figure-of-merit (ZT), especially p-type HH alloys. In the present work, a state-of-the-art <em>ZT</em> ~ 1 at 873K was realized in p-type nanostructured Zr<sub>1-x</sub>Hf<sub>x</sub>CoSb<sub>0.9</sub>Sn<sub>0.1 </sub>alloys employing compositional modulation of the Zr site with its heavier homologue Hf, which leads a substantial increase in its power factor coupled with a concurrent decrease in its thermal conductivity. These alloys were synthesized using high-energy ball-milling of the arc-melted ingots, followed by the spark plasma sintering of the resulting HH alloy nano-powders.  The partial substitution of Hf at the Zr site results in an alloy disorder and local potential energy fluctuations, which modify the band-structure and favorably optimizing the carrier concentration, leading to an enhancement in the power factor. Concurrently, a reduction in the phonon mean-free-path is observed on Hf-substitution, which is comparable to the average crystallite size (~25 nm), thus resulting in an abundant scattering of heat-carrying phonon scattering by nano-scale grain boundaries, leading to a very low thermal conductivity of ~2.2 Wm<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup> at 873K, which is amongst the lowest reported in HH alloys.  The TE device characteristics, estimated using cumulative temperature dependence model for quantitative evaluation of TE performance, yielded an output power density of ~10 Wcm<sup>-2 </sup>&shy;in p-type with a leg efficiency of ~10% in these synthesized Hf-substituted nanostructured samples.
834	Electronic and Geometric Stabilities of Ti<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>n </sub>(n=3-24) Clusters	We performed the genetic algorithm (GA) incorporated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the atomic and electronic properties of a series of Ti<sub>2</sub>Sin (n=3-24) clusters. Comprehensive consideration on the formation energy, the second difference in cluster energy and the addition energy of Si to a Ti<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>n&#x2212;1</sub> cluster as well as the HOMO-LUMO gap, our results show that Ti<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>4</sub> cluster is the most stable one in the series of clusters, followed by the Ti<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>13</sub>, Ti<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>21</sub>, Ti<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>15</sub> and Ti<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>7</sub> clusters, which can be understood by the combination of symmetry and electron shell filling rule. The silicon cage could be obviously enhanced by doping double Ti atoms making it a promising nanoscale materials.
835	Effect of gain medium and graphene on the resonance energy transfer between two molecules positioned near a plasmonic multilayer nanoparticle	In this study&#x200E;, &#x200E;we investigate the transfer of energy from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule close a spherical multilayer nanoparticle consisting of a core surrounded by two shells (core@shell@shell nanoparticle), with focus on the role of the graphene and gain medium on the resonance energy transfer between molecules&#x200E;&#x200E;. We derive an analytical expression for the interaction energy in a hybrid plasmonic nanoshell-molecular system consisting of a pair molecules positioned near a plasmonic three-layer nanoparticle. &#x200E;Owing to more flexible tunability of multishell nanoparticles&#x200E;, &#x200E;the resonance energy transfer can be enhanced and tuned from IR-visible-UV regions by controlling the size of the nanosphere core or shells&#x200E;. In addition to the effect of the gain medium which enhances the plasmonic resonance in order of magnitude&#x200E;, &#x200E;the impact of graphene-coated three-layer nanosphere on the energy transfer is studied by taking into account the role of dipolar&#x200E;, &#x200E;quadrupolar&#x200E;, &#x200E;octupolar&#x200E;, &#x200E;hexadecapolar&#x200E;, &#x200E;triakontadipolar plasmonic modes&#x200E;.
836	Fabrication of a precise ellipsoidal mirror for soft X-ray nanofocusing	In X-ray focusing, the grazing incidence mirror offers advantages of no chromatic aberration and high focusing efficiency. Although nanofocusing mirrors have been developed for hard X-ray regions, there is no mirror with nanofocusing performance in soft X-ray regions. Designing a focusing system smaller than 100 nm at an X-ray energy of less than 1 keV requires a numerical aperture larger than 0.01. This leads to difficulties in the fabrication of a soft X-ray focusing mirror with high accuracy. Ellipsoidal mirrors enable soft X-ray focusing with a high numerical aperture. In this study, we report a fabrication process for ellipsoidal mirrors involving mandrel fabrication and replication processes. The fabricated ellipsoidal mirror was assessed under partial illumination conditions at the soft X-ray beamline (BL25SU) of SPring-8. A focal size of less than 250 nm was confirmed at 300 eV. The focusing tests indicated that the proposed fabrication process is promising for X-ray mirrors with a solid of revolution, including Wolter mirrors.
837	Effect of thickness, impurity concentration, surface roughness and temperature on transport coefficients and thermoelectric properties of ultra-thin silicon nanowires	The electronic, thermal, and thermoelectric coefficients of ultra-thin silicon nanowires are calculated analytically taking into account acoustic phonon, surface roughness, and impurity scattering as the dominant scattering mechanisms. The quantum-wire electronic subbands and chemical potential are obtained within effective mass and envelope function approximation. To determine the low-field electron mobility and lattice thermal conductivity, relaxation time approximation within linear response theory is employed. Thermoelectric properties are studied over a wide range of thicknesses (3--11 nm), doping densities (3 10<sup>15</sup>--10<sup>19</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>), and temperatures (200--700 K). It is shown that the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of ultra-thin silicon nanowires increases with increasing temperature and doping density in the range investigated. Furthermore, the ZT variation with quantum confinement or nanowire cross-section reaches a peak value of 0.23 at 8 nm thickness, at room temperature and doping density 10<sup>19 </sup>cm<sup>-3</sup>. The results of this comprehensive analytic study are found to be in good agreement with elaborate Monte Carlo simulations where available, while the method also allows for better physical understanding of the effects of different factors involved.
838	Effective patterning and cleaning of graphene by plasma etching and block copolymer lithography for nanoribbons fabrication	Patterning 2D materials at a sub-20 nm resolution is mandatory in a large number of applications to bring or control the overall material's and device's properties. In this work, we present our results on the fabrication of graphene nanoribbons using a block copolymer thin film as lithography mask. A special emphasis is given to the development of needed plasma etching processes to pattern graphene and to chemically clean the fabricated nanostructures. At the end, clean 10 nm wide graphene nanoribbons are obtained as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, XPS, AFM and SEM characterizations. Block copolymer lithography and proper plasma etching conditions allow an ease of graphene patterning at large area capabilities and low-cost processing.
839	Nonlinear shear and dilatational rheology of viscoelastic interfacial layers of cellulosenanocrystals	We present a nonlinear rheological investigation of model rod-like particles at the air/water interface in dilatation and shear. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) were chemically modified to vary their surface hydrophobicity, creating a range of surface-active particles with varying contact angle. The interfacial shear properties were studied using a series of frequency sweeps in small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS), large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS), and large amplitude oscillatory dilatation (LAOD) in a range of amplitudes to include the nonlinear behavior. A multi-mode Maxwell model was used to fit the frequency sweeps that were performed during the formation of the interfacial layer. A shift towards longer relaxation times was found, more pronounced for particles with higher hydrophobicity. Lissajous plots in LAOS revealed strain stiffening, yielding, and unconstrained flow of the interfacial layers. They had a rhombus-like shape at high deformations for particles with high hydrophobicity and a leaf-like shape for particles with low hydrophobicity. Lissajous plots in LAOD revealed strain hardening in compression and strain softening in expansion, increasing with surface pressure and with particle hydrophobicity. While interfacial layers commonly show gel or solid-like behavior, our findings imply a weakly aggregated system. The differences in relaxation times and yielding behavior indicate the formation of larger clusters within the interfacial layers of particles with high hydrophobicity as compared to smaller clusters within the interfacial layers of particles with low hydrophobicity. The particle-particle interactions therefore vary with hydrophobicity, suggesting capillary interactions are important for the formation of these microstructures.
840	Non-uniform heat source-sink effect on MHD stagnation point Maxwell-nanofluid flow over a convectively heated stretching surface with chemical reaction	An analysis is made to examine the effect of non-uniform heat source/sink on the boundary layer hydro-dynamic stagnation point flow of an upper-convected Maxwell-nanofluid over a convectively heated stretching surface with chemical reaction. The governing partial differential equations (PDEs) are transformed into the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by suitable similarity transformations. The shooting technique is used to solve the set of ODEs with the help of the MATLAB. To strengthen the numerical results obtained through the shooting technique, the built-in MATLAB function bvp4c is also invoked.

841	Morphology Controlling of Ultrathin MoS2/MoO2 Nanosheets Grown by Chemical Vapor Deposition	The morphology of MoS2 plays an important role in its applications and properties, such as electronics and catalysts. Herein, the morphology of as-grown MoS2, synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using S and MoO3 powder as reactants, were study by tuning the distance between MoO3 and substrate and the distance between S and MoO3 powder. The distance between MoO3 and substrate was deliberately reduced to obtain a sharp gradient of MoO3 precursor concentration on the growth substrate, and the region of sulfur was changed to obtain different sulfur concentration and initial reaction temperature, as a result, morphology evolution including two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 and MoS2/MoO2 freestanding nanosheets was observed. A mechanism was proposed to explain the morphology transformation between horizontal 2D flake and freestanding nanosheets. Based on this mechnism, syntheses method of dense, ultrathin, large size MoS2 freestanding nanosheets were proposed. These results may be further generalized to create novel nanostructured devices.
842	A new leak element built from graphene oxide membranes	A leak element built from a graphene oxide membrane has been developed using the modified Hummers' and vacuum filtration methods. He, Ne, Ar, and Kr leak rates across the element were measured using a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The various gases flows across the leak element occured via molecular flow at pressures of up to 500 kPa since graphene oxide (GO) is a nanoporous material. The leak rates of various gases at particular pressures could be predicted based on knowing the leak rate of one gas at a specific pressure. When the membrane thickness was below 600 nm, the main gas permeation paths were aligned defects across the GO membrane and the leak rate had an exponential relationship with the thickness. In contrast, the main gas permeation paths were spaces between layers and the leak rate was inversely proportional to the membrane thickness when the latter exceeded 600 nm.
843	Effective Charge Collection Area during Conductive and Photoconductive Atomic Force Microscopy Measurements	Conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) has been widely used to map the nanoscale electrical properties of conducting polymers, nanomaterials, and organic electronic devices. While these measurements provide valuable insight into the spatial dependence of electrical performance, reported current densities and electrical conductivities measured by C-AFM are consistently much higher than those measured at the macroscopic scale. Here, we demonstrate that these anomalously high current densities and conductivities arise from ignoring current spreading and hence underestimating the current-carrying area. We present a simple experimental means of estimating the effective charge collection area during C-AFM measurements. Using semiconducting polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) films as a test case, we find that the effective charge collection area can be as much as three orders of magnitude larger than the mechanical contact area between the probe and film. Calibrated conductivity maps are obtained, with a quantitative correspondence with accepted values, and C AFM photocurrent measurements of a nanostructured hybrid organic-inorganic solar cell active layer yield short-circuit current densities that match those reported for macroscopic devices. Finally, we address the observation that current spreading increases the effective charge collection area beyond the size of the probe-sample contact, but does not preclude an imaging resolution below 10 nm.
844	Sign identification of electron and hole out-of-plane g factors by utilizing nuclear spin switch in single quantum nanostructures	The electron and hole g factors are the key quantities for the spin manipulations in semiconductor quantum nanostructures. However, for the individual nanostructures, the separate determination including the signs of those g factors is difficult by using some methods adopted conventionally in bulks and quantum wells. We report a convenient optical method for the sign identification of out-of-plane g factors in the individual quantum nanostructures, which utilizes the optically-induced nuclear spin switch. The method is demonstrated in typical single self-assembled In$_{0.75}$Al$_{0.25}$As/Al$_{0.3}$Ga$_{0.7}$As quantum dots and InAs/GaAs quantum rings, where the g factors with the opposite sign for electron and the same sign for hole are proved.
845	<SPAN style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 175%; color: windowtext;">Theoretical prediction of monolayer SnP<sub>3</sub> as an ultrafast and reversible anode for high-performance Na-ion batteries</SPAN>	Tin (Sn) as a cheaper and more environment-friendly alternative to lead has been widely used in the field of green energy. Especially, Sn-based nano-materials have attracted tremendous attention in Na-ion batteries. Interestingly, the layered bulk structure of SnP<sub>3 </sub>has been experimentally synthesized since 1970, which is metallic and stable at room temperature. Based on first-principles calculations, we predict that the production of monolayer SnP<sub>3 </sub>by<sub> </sub>exfoliation of bulk crystal could be feasible with the moderate cleavage energy (~1.10 J/m<sup>2</sup>). Due to strong interlayer quantum confinement effects, the single-layer SnP<sub>3</sub> is an indirect semiconductor with a small band gap (0.68 eV). Furthermore, we explore SnP<sub>3</sub> as an anode for Na-ion batteries. Upon Na adsorption, the semiconducting SnP<sub>3 </sub>transforms to a metallic state, ensuring a good electrical conductivity. Specially, the ultra-low energy barrier (0.03 eV) of Na diffusion on SnP<sub>3</sub> indicates an ultrafast charge/discharge rate. During the Na adsorption process, the slight volume variations (&lt; 4 %) suggest a good cycling reversibility. The theoretical specific capacity (253.31 mA&middot;h&middot;g<sup>-1</sup>) and moderate average electron potential (1.29 V) are in between those of commercial anodes, graphite and TiO<sub>2</sub>. These results demonstrate that SnP<sub>3</sub> has the potential for application in high-performance Na-ion batteries.
846	Nanoindentation of a Steigmann-Ogden surface bounding an elastic half-space	Literature studies demonstrate that, for nanostructures under transverse bending, the effective Young's modulus is appreciably greater (in magnitude) than that of the same elements under axial loads. Therefore, in addition to the conventional residual surface tension and membrane stiffness, the curvature dependence of surface energy is desired for inhomogeneously strained nanostructures. In this paper, we aim to reevaluate the size-dependent elastic behavior of an elastic half-space subjected to nanosized frictionless tractions, by the use of both the curvature-independent Gurtin-Murdoch and curvature-dependent Steigmann-Ogden models of surface elasticity. The nanoindentation problem is solved by the integration of Bousssinesq's method of displacement potentials and Hankel integral transforms. As examples, the effects of residual surface tension, tensile stiffness and bending rigidity of the half-space boundary are parametrically analyzed in detail for a uniform circular pressure and a concentrated normal force. The observations in semianalytical calculations suggest a significant difference in nanoindentation hardnesses predicted from the two popular models of surface mechanics. In most cases, the inclusion of bending rigidity results in lower displacements and stresses, and therefore higher indentation hardness. Based on physically interpretable numerical values of surface material properties, we show that a curvature-dependent model of surface elasticity is required in order to correctly characterize the size-dependent feature of nanoindentation problems.
847	<strong>The dependence of Schottky (I&#x2012;V) characteristics on the metal probe size in nano metal&#x2012;semiconductor contacts</strong>	We have studied the dependence of Schottky (I&#x2012;V) characteristics on the metal contact size in nanoscale metal&#x2012;semiconductor (M&#x2012;S) junctions. Using special nano&#x2012;probes in conductive atomic force microscope, we have shown that the Schottky (I&#x2012;V) characteristic of M&#x2012;S junction depends strongly on the metal contact size, rather than the semiconductor bulk properties as in the planar microscale M&#x2012;S junctions. The theoretical calculations from our model show good agreement with the experimental (I&#x2012;V) data for a wide range of nano&#x2012;probe sizes. Our results indicate the strong correlation between electric field at the M&#x2012;S interface and the Schottky rectification behavior. The calculated (I&#x2012;V) data show a smooth transition from the reverse rectification behavior to the normal rectification behavior as the nano&#x2012;probe radius increases from sub-10 nm to 100 nm. Our results clearly demonstrate the effect of metal contact size in nano Schottky diodes, which would help in designing a new type of nano-devices at sub-10 nm scale.
848	Perspective: How to Understand Electronic Friction	Electronic friction is a  correction to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, whereby nuclei in motion experience a drag in the presence of a manifold of electronic states. The notion of electronic friction has a long history and has been (re-)discovered in the context of a wide variety of different chemical and physical systems including, but not limited to, surface scattering events, surface reactions or chemisorption, electrochemistry, and conduction through molecular-(or nano-) junctions.  Over the years,  quite a few different forms of electronic friction have been offered in the literature. In this perspective, we briefly review these developments of electronic friction, highlighting the fact that we can now isolate a single, unifying form for (Markovian) electronic friction. We also focus on the role of electron-electron interactions for understanding frictional effects, and offer our thoughts on the strengths and weaknesses of using electronic friction to model dynamics in general.
849	Ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity in monolayers and nanoplatelets of SnS	The ground-state structure of monolayers and nanoplatelets of SnS with a thickness from two to five monolayers is calculated from first principles. It is shown that nanoobjects with only odd number of monolayers are ferroelectric. The ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and elastic properties of these polar structures are calculated. The appearance of polarization in these nanoobjects is explained by an uncompensated polarization that exists in antiferroelectric structure of bulk SnS. The mechanism of ferroelectricity in which the ferroelectric distortion results from short-range ordering of lone pairs can be regarded as a way of creating ferroelectrics with high Curie temperature.
850	Integration of ferroelectric Pb(Zr<sub>0.52</sub>Ti<sub>0.48</sub>)O<sub>3</sub> thin films on conducting nanocrystalline diamond for high performance device applications.	We report on the direct integration of Pb(Zr<sub>0.52</sub>Ti<sub>0.48</sub>)O<sub>3</sub> (PZT) thin film on hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) grown conducting boron doped nanocrystalline diamond (B-NCD) film. A conducting B-NCD thin film with grain size less than 100 nm and surface roughness close to 8 nm is used as a metallic bottom electrode. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy revealed the single phase perovskite ferroelectric nature of the PZT thin film deposited directly on the conducting B-NCD film. The macroscopic and nanoscale polarization switching experiments are performed to confirm ferroelectric nature of the PZT/B-NCD heterostructures. The narrow degradation of remanent polarization ( 10%) even after 10<sup>10</sup> switching cycles of the sample demonstrates the excellent ferroelectric performance of the heterostructures.
851	<strong>Ferroelectric Monoclinic Phases in Strained K<sub>0.70</sub>Na<sub>0.30</sub>NbO<sub>3</sub> Thin Films Promoting Selective Surface Acoustic Wave Propagation</strong>	We present a detailed analysis of the ferroelectric domain structure of K<sub>0.70</sub>Na<sub>0.30</sub>NbO<sub>3</sub> thin films on (110) TbScO<sub>3</sub> grown by metal organic chemical vapor deposition. Upon piezoresponse force microscopy and nanofocus X-ray diffraction measurements we derive a domain model revealing monoclinic M<sub>C</sub> domains. The complex domain pattern is formed out of four co-existing in-plane orientations of the shearing direction of the monoclinic unit cell resulting in four types of superdomains each being composed of well-ordered stripe domains. Finally, we present surface acoustic wave (SAW) experiments that exhibit extraordinary signal intensities given the low thickness of the tested film. Moreover, the SAW propagation is found to occur selectively along the identified shearing directions.
852	Noble rotary trigger double spark gap switch for high-repetitive nanosecond pulse generator and production of silver nano-colloid	High-voltage, high-repetition nanosecond pulse generation technology plays a key role for underwater discharge applications such as water treatment and metal nano-colloid production. For this application, a high-voltage, high-speed switching technology is crucial for fast transferring the energy stored in the capacitor to the electrodes in water. In this study, a noble rotary trigger double spark gap switch was developed for this purpose. Two spark gaps for charge and discharge are arranged in this switch, and they eliminate the irregular and unstable pulse generation due to the simultaneous charging and discharging in the pulse generating circuits. Using this technique, pulses with 12 kV, 100 ns rise time were generated at a repetition rate of 150 pulse per second and applied to underwater discharge to produce silver nano-colloid.
853	<strong>Electronic transition processes related to deep levels in a p-GaN layer analyzed by time-resolved photoluminescence using various excitation photon energies</strong>	Electronic transition via deep levels of GaN is investigated using two types of excitation laser photon energies in time resolved photoluminescence analysis: higher than the bandgap energy (<em>E</em><sub>g</sub>) (AEG) and lower than <em>E</em><sub>g</sub> (BEG). Various color luminescence components are observed for both the excitation conditions. The spectra in the energy region below <em>E</em><sub>g</sub> for the BEG excitations have no clear peaks as observed by the AEG excitations. It is thought that the luminescence components caused by the BEG excitations originate from the electronic transitions from the deep levels to the states in the vicinity of the valence band (NVB), which is different from the transitions from the states in the vicinity of the conduction band (NCB) to the deep levels observed by AEG excitations. The decay rates of the transitions from the deep levels to the NVB states are in the order of tens of nanoseconds, which is shorter than the values of hundreds of nanoseconds to microseconds for the transitions from the NCB states to the deep levels obtained in the present analysis and previous reports.
854	<strong>Secondary electron emission characteristics of the TiN coatings produced by RF magnetron sputtering</strong>	Multipactor, a detrimental effect in space high power systems, can degrade the performance of space microwave components or even cause a devastation. Surface coatings with low secondary electron yield (SEY) have been verified to mitigate multipactor efficiently, and some literatures indicate that Titanium Nitride (TiN) coating is an excellent multipactor suppressor due to its recognized low SEY. Whereas, so far, theoretical analysis for interpreting the secondary electron emission (SEE) characteristics of TiN coatings is scarce. In this work, we experimentally and theoretically investigate SEE characteristics of TiN coatings. We fabricate seven TiN coatings under different N<sub>2 </sub>concentration by RF sputtering. Microscopic analysis indicates that the nanostructured TiN coatings are more likely to be formed at low N<sub>2</sub> concentration, inversely, it is more likely to form the compact TiN films when N<sub>2</sub> concentration is high. SEY measurement shows the nanostructured TiN coatings are more efficient to trap the electrons than the compact TiN films does. Furthermore, via measuring the resistivity, we find a novel regularity that the variation of SEY largely depends on the resistivity for the compact TiN films. Namely, SEY of the compact TiN films linearly decreases as their resistivity exponentially declines. Then, we establish an equation to describe the SEY as a function of resistivity via applying semiconductor conductivity theory to the Dionne&rsquo;s SEE model. The equation qualitatively interprets the experiment regularity. This work presents a probability to control SEY of the TiN coatings by adjusting resistivity, and is of significance to comprehend the SEE of semiconductors.
855	Bimodal distribution of defects energy states in Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:Er nanoparticles probed by photoluminescence quenching	The advantage of Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:Er nanoparticles as a material for energy applications lies in an alternative channel for UV-visible conversion through Gd<sup>3+</sup>&rarr;Er<sup>3+</sup> energy transfer, which doesn&rsquo;t require special introduction of donor ions into the matrix since this role is played by defective cations. The influence of Gd<sup>3+</sup> defective nature on excitation-relaxation processes determining the overall conversion efficiency remains poorly understood. From analysis of luminescence temperature behavior, we found a bimodal distribution of energy barrier for Er<sup>3+</sup> emission quenching after indirect excitation. The reason for this is assumed to the different energy structure of defective Gd<sup>3+</sup> donors, which occupy structurally non-equivalent cationic positions in Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> host lattice. This study provides a new knowledge about behavior of excited states and regularities of energy conversion in rare-earth nanoscale materials.
856	Low-threshold, mid-infrared backward-wave parametric oscillator with periodically poled Rb:KTP	We report on the development of a nanosecond mirrorless OPO pumped at 1 &#x00B5;m. The gain medium of the OPO was periodically poled Rubidium-doped KTP with a grating period of &#x039B; = 509 nm for first order quasi-phase matching. For grating periods of this length, we demonstrate backward propagation of the signal field and forward propagation of the idler field. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a counter-propagating geometry has been demonstrated in mirrorless OPOs. Pumping with a maximum energy of 6.48 mJ, the OPO yielded an overall conversion efficiency exceeding 53 % with signal and idler energies of 1.96 mJ and 1.46 mJ respectively. The generated signal and idler field spectra were measured to show narrowband linewidths on the order of 0.5 nm. We motivate that such a MOPO is ideal for seeding applications and discuss further improvements and work.
857	<strong>The role of convection in gas and liquid phases at droplet evaporation</strong>	The article presents the measuring results of droplet velocity and temperature fields using non-contact optical methods: Particle Image Velocity (PIV), Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) and Thermal imager. The novelty of the work is that the influence of free convection in gas and liquid is investigated experimentally and theoretically and that the key criteria affecting heat and mass transfer are determined. The analysis of experimental data has shown that in the initial period of water drop evaporation, the predominant role in the heat exchange is played by the thermal Marangoni convection. However, for an aqueous salt solution, in spite of the strong influence of the surfactant, the dominant role passes to the solutal Marangoni convection (<em>Ma<sub>C</sub></em>). The results of the analysis contained in this article can be used to describe not only drops and thin films of solutions, including nano- and micro-coatings, but drops falling on the wall. This is due to the fact that in the first seconds after the drop falling, convection and heat transfer in the liquid are maximum. Under such conditions it is important to realize an accurate numerical simulation to assess the degree of the wall cooling and to calculate the non-stationary evaporation. When simulating heat transfer, it is incorrect to neglect free convection in gas or liquid due to their strong nonlinear influence on each other. The heat exchange in the drop is extremely conservative to convection in the liquid (the Peclet number <em>Pe</em> = 100 and the Nusselt number <em>Nu</em> = 4).
858	<strong>Exploitation of nanoparticle-protein interactions for early disease detection</strong>	The main diagnostic tools for primary and metastatic central nervous system tumors are the anamnestic neurological examination and the imaging tests, which are expensive and lack of specificity. In recent years, the shell of macromolecules that forms on nanoparticles when they are exposed to human blood, also known as hard corona (HC) became a powerful tool in diagnostics. Indeed HC can act as a &ldquo;nano-concentrator&rdquo; of serum proteins and can detect minor changes in protein concentration at the very early stages of disease development. In this paper, we characterized HC of blood samples from patients affected by meningeal tumorson lipid nanoparticles. We found that the HCs of meningeal tumor patients could be discriminated from those of healthy subjects. Our results show that emerging HC-based technologies could open new horizons towards central nervous system cancer early diagnosis.
859	Multiscale simulations of critical interfacial failure in carbon nanotube-polymer composites	Computational investigation of interfacial failure in composite materials is challenging because it is inherently multi-scale: the bond-breaking processes that occur at the covalently bonded interface and initiate failure involve quantum mechanical phenomena, yet the mechanisms by which external stresses are transferred through the matrix occur on length and time-scales far in excess of anything that can be simulated quantum mechanically. In this work, we demonstrate and validate an adaptive quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulation method that can be used to address these issues and apply it to study critical failure at covalently bonded carbon nanotube (CNT)-polymer interface. In this hybrid approach, the majority of the system is simulated with a classical forcefield, while areas of particular interest are identified on-the-fly and atomic forces in those regions are updated based on QM calculations. We demonstrate that the hybrid method results are in excellent agreement with fully-QM benchmark simulations and offers qualitative insights missing from classical simulations. We use the hybrid approach to show how chemical structure at the CNT-polymer interface determines its strength and we propose candidate chemistries to guide further experimental work in this area.
860	<strong>Photoluminescence and optical properties of MO<sub>3</sub>-B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-CeO<sub>2</sub>-Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (M= Mo or W) glasses and their counterparts nano-glass-ceramics</strong>	8MO<sub>3</sub>-30B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-<em>x</em>CeO<sub>2</sub>-(62-<em>x</em>)Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> glasses (where M= Mo or W and <em>x</em>= 2,5,8; in mol%) were fabricated employing the conventional melt-quench method. The amorphous nature of the glasses was demonstrated using X-ray diffraction. From the ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, it was found that increase of the CeO<sub>2</sub> content led to a red-shift, i.e. shift towards longer wavelengths, in the optical absorption edge of glasses, a gradual decrease in their band gap energy and a slight increase in the refractive index. Differential thermal analysis was utilized to determine the peaks of crystallization temperatures at which a successful nano-crystallization has been achieved. The obtained nano-glass-ceramics include nano-crystallites of monoclinic bismuth molybdate (Bi<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>6</sub>) and orthorhombic Russellite (Bi<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>6</sub>) as major crystalline phases within the Mo- and W-containing glassy matrices, respectively. Morphology of these nano-crystallites was investigated by High resolution transmission electron microscope which revealed average crystallites sizes in the range of 6-26 nm. Photoluminescence (PL) of the as-quenched glasses as well as their counterparts nano-glass-ceramics was studied and discussed. PL spectroscopy indicated that the glasses are red phosphors emitting red light at 600 and 610 nm upon UV excitation at 300 nm. The nano-glass-ceramics exhibited very broad emission spectra, extending in a wide range in the visible region, which consist of prominent bluish-violet emissions with a minority of green and red emission bands under UV excitation at 254 and 280 nm.
861	Gold nanoparticle distribution in polyelectrolyte brushes loaded at different pH conditions	Composites made of polymer brushes with inclusions of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) combine the responsive nature of polymer brushes with the optical properties of the AuNPs, which offers the possibility to be used as colorimetric sensors. To this end, it is crucial to know how AuNPs are distributed inside the brush. Here, this distribution was elucidated by reflectometry (NR) with contrast variation, and a self-consistent reflectivity analysis based on the analytical parametrization of the volume fraction profiles of all chemical components. In contrast to former studies this analysis allows the determination of the spatial distribution of components separately from each other: polyelectrolyte, AuNP and water. Cationic poly-[2-(Methacryloyloxy) ethyl] trimethylammonium chloride (PMETAC) brushes were loaded with 5 nm AuNPs, which were coated with a pH-sensitive capping. The pH was varied during the incubation of the brush in the AuNP suspension. At lower pH, AuNPs form aggregates in suspension and are attached to the brush periphery. They adsorb into the brush but do not fully penetrate it due to their bulkiness. At higher pH, AuNP suspensions are electrostatically stabilized and the AuNPs penetrate the brush entirely. However, the AuNP distribution over the brush is not homogeneous but decreases gradually towards the substrate. Penetration of the AuNPs leads to a more extended conformation of the brush. According to the results of the detailed analysis of all components, increase in water content could be excluded as a reason for brush swelling but a replacement of water by the AuNP was observed.

863	Mask-free Fabrication and chemical vapor deposition synthesis of ultra-thin zinc oxide nanoribbons on Si/SiO2 and 2D substrates	Authors report on fabrication and characterization of thin zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoribbons with controlled geometries produced on the substrates via direct-write patterning (DWP) approach. A two-step process was employed to selectively grow precise patterns of thin ZnO nanoribbons. Direct write patterning (DWP) of iron (Fe) catalytic ink and subsequent chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis was utilized in the fabrication of ZnO nanoribbons on different substrates. It was found that iron aqueous ink promoted the formation of ZnO nanostructures at patterned locations. High-quality ZnO nanoribbons were fabricated with optimized patterning parameters and specific growth conditions. The ability to control the thickness of ZnO nanoribbons on Si/SiO2 was demonstrated through the adjustment of the writing-speeds. It was determined that higher speed of writing resulted in thinner ZnO nanoribbons, while slower speeds facilitated the thicker nanoribbons formation during the growth.  Arrays of ZnO nanoribbons with controlled thicknesses, of 2nm, 4nm, and 8nm, were produced on Si/SiO2 substrate with the widths ranging from 3-6 &#x00B5;m. This mask-free scalable two-step protocol was also employed to produce arrays of ZnO nanoribbons on two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as Graphene and Boron Nitride thin films, effectively creating ZnO/2D heterostructures. These experiments demonstrated the compatibility of grapahene (Gr) and boron nitride (BN) surfaces with the ZnO fabrication process, and could provide opportunities for the integration of patterned ZnO thin film into different types of architectures for improved and more efficient devices and scalable technologies.
864	<strong>Biosensor response from target molecules with inhomogeneous charge localization</strong>	We analyzed the sensor response from aptamer-modified carbon nanotube thin film transistors that adsorb immunoglobulin E (IgE) with an inhomogeneous charge distribution. The net charge of the target molecules within the Debye length reflects the polarity of the electrical sensor signal. The complicated sensor response, which depends on the Debye length, can be interpreted by two kinds of adsorption states considering the influence of steric hindrance by previously adsorbed IgE molecules. These results explain the anomalous behavior of the sensor response in previous reports and pave the way to control the dynamic range.
865	Relativistic ultrafast electron microscopy with MeV femtosecond electron pulses	We have developed a prototype relativistic ultrafast electron microscope (UEM) with a 3.1 MeV femtosecond-pulsed electron beam generated by a radio-frequency gun. In demonstrations of the relativistic UEM, high-quality single-shot electron diffraction images have been detected from gold single crystals. TEM images of 400-nm-diameter gold nanoparticles were observed, and the dependence of the images on the pulse number was investigated. The results demonstrate that relativistic UEM using the rf gun can be applied to the study of ultrafast structural dynamics in femtosecond or picosecond time regimes if we can increase further the brightness of the pulses to 10<sup>12</sup> e<sup>-</sup>/mm<sup>2</sup>mrad<sup>2</sup>.

To define and characterize the nanoclusters, a well-known maximum separation algorithm was applied to the APT data. Applying input parameters to the cluster selection algorithm, Mg<sub>2</sub>Si nanoclusters in &alpha;-aluminum matrix were quantitatively analyzed and their size distributions and average sizes were determined. The results presented herein are crucial to understand the age-hardening process as a function of solid solution aluminum decomposition sequence.
867	<strong>Modeling of Large Permittivity of poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) and Nanospring Single-Walled Carbon Nano Tubes-polyvinylpyrrolidone Nano Composites </strong>	The highly dispersible nanospring single-walled carbon nano tubes (NS-CNTs) is incorporated in the P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer, one of widely scrutinized ferro- and piezo-electric polymer, up to the value of 15 wt% as nanofillers. The relative dielectric constant (<em>K</em>) of polymer nanocomposite, at 1 kHz, was greatly enhanced from 12.7 to the value of 62.5 at 11 wt% contents of NS-CNTs, corresponding to a 492 % increase compared to that of pristine P(VDF-TrFE) with only a small dielectric loss tangent (<em>D</em>) of 0.1. Based on two theoretical models called Bruggeman equation and self-consistent effective medium theory (SC-EMT), the experimental data of the permittivity of P(VDF-TrFE) and NS-CNTsnanocomposites have been simulated to estimate the dielectric constant of NS-CNTs while changing both the shape of nanofillers and the volume fraction of the interface with the increase of the number of NS-CNTs piled layers in P(VDF-TrFE) matrix. The number of NS-CNTs layers was counted from HRTEM images to calculate the interfacial volume fraction and used to infer the Eshelby tensor of NS-CNTs in the SC-EMT model. As the result, experimentally measured dielectric constants of the composite films were well fitted with the Bruggeman equation and SC-EMT theory in the range of dielectric constant <em>k</em>=240-360, which means that NS-CNTs nanofillers are considered electrically semiconductive.
868	<strong>Deterministic role of frequency, amplitude and concentration regimes on the complex dielectric relaxation of colloidal complex fluids</strong>	The present article explores the governing roles played by concentration regimes, frequency and amplitude of the forcing electric field on the dynamic dielectric responses of  nanocolloidal non-polar suspensions. Frequency dependent complex dielectric constants were determined in the band of 1 to 10<sup>7 </sup>Hz at constant temperature via dielectric spectroscopy. In addition to prevalant literature measurements, influence of field amplitude has also been performed to investigate the role of electric field intensity upon the relaxation behaviors.  The experimental observations reveal that variation of frequency, as well as choice of particle material significantly influences the dielectric responses of nanocolloids. Further, the amplitude of field is found to induce differences in the dielectric response. It is also observed that the relaxation responses are grossly different for concentrated dispersions than the dilute counterparts. The concentration regimes are observed to bring about overlapping relaxation responses in the colloids.  Good degree of quantitative agreement has been found between the experimental observations and the generic Havriliak-Negami relaxation model.  It has been shown that for a given nanomaterial, reduction of relaxation time scale is a direct consequence of enhancement in concentration and the colloids transit from predominantly storage to leaky systems with concentration regimes. Additionally, the reported volume diffusion mechanism (VDM) is found to be in compliance with the experimental findings. The occurrence and shift of peaks and valleys in the dielectric spectra has been explained based on dielectric response theories for electrically heterogeneous media.
869	Dynamics of material modifications during a high-power nanosecond laser irradiation in fused silica	The real-time responses of the optical performance of fused silica, including transmission, reflection, and scattering, during a nanosecond laser irradiation at 355 nm were simultaneously measured using a time-resolved technique, which enables the analysis of material modifications that occur throughout the high-power laser irradiation with a picosecond sampling interval. During a single pulse irradiation, once the transient power exceeded the threshold, the transmission exhibited a sudden and significant reduction at the rising edge of the high-power laser pulse, accompanied with an increase in reflection, attributed to stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). With the increase of the single pulse intensity, following the sudden occurrence of SBS, the appearance of a scattering spike indicated the generation of damage; the scattering ratio continued to increase during the irradiation, revealing the growth of the damage. By combining a spectral analysis and image acquisition, a broadband emission emerging from the creation of plasma was observed during the damage event. Considering the filamentary structure of the damage, the interaction among the SBS, plasma, and formation of the laser damage in fused silica was discussed.
870	Descriptors for the Reactivity of Au Nanocatalysts: Evaluating the Performance of the <i>d</i>-band center, the Effective Coordination Number and the Dual-Center Descriptor	Though extended gold systems are inert, gold nanoparticles have been found to be reactive and good catalysts for several commercially important reactions. Their efficacy as catalysts is known to be sensitive to parameters such as size, morphology and charge state. With a view to aiding catalyst design, we evaluate the performance of three suggested descriptors for reactivity, viz., the popular <i>d</i>-band center &#x03B5;<sub><i>d</i></sub>, and two less-known alternatives:  effective coordination number, ECN, and the dual-center descriptor, &#x0394;&#x03B5; = &#x03B5;<sub><i>sp</i></sub> - &#x03B5;<sub><i>d</i></sub> (where s&#x03B5;<sub><i>sp</i></sub> is the center of the <i>sp</i>-bands). Using the strength of binding to O<sub>2</sub> as a measure of reactivity, we evaluate the success of the three descriptors in correctly predicting trends in reactivity: (a) when the coordination number is lowered by varying the structure and/or dimensionality in real and hypothetical Au systems, (b) when the adsorption site within an Au nanocluster is varied, and (c) when the charge state is modified. All three descriptors are successful to  varying extents in the different situations considered; however, the only descriptor that is able to correctly predict trends in binding in all cases is &#x0394;&#x03B5;. This reflects the fact that <i>s</i> and <i>p</i> electrons often play a significant role in the reactivity of gold nanoparticles; their behavior should therefore ideally be incorporated within an effective descriptor.
871	Truly random number generator based on thermally activated magnetization backhopping in nanoscale ring-shaped magnetic tunnel junctions	A true random number generator based on the magnetization backhopping process in nano-ring magnetic tunnel junctions with no applied field is demonstrated in this work. Backhopping occurs at higher current beyond the critical switching current. The impact of environmental temperature (<em>T</em>) and current pulse width (<em>&tau;</em>) on backhopping is investigated statistically in experiments, micromagnetic simulation and theoretical analysis. The backhopping probability increases at high <em>T </em>and wide <em>&tau;</em>, explained by the combined effect of thermal fluctuation and spin-transfer-torque noise. The magnetoresistance at backhopping is randomly distributed over a large operational range. This manifestation of backhopping in magnetic tunnel junctions can be used as the basic unit of a true random number generator.
872	Oxidation mechanisms of Y doped CrAlSiN coatings at 1100{degree sign}C	The oxidation mechanisms of Y doped CrN/AlSiN nanolayered coatings were investigated at 1100{degree sign}C. Although Y doping showed limited effects in stopping the penetration of oxygen into the coating, it played an important role of slowing down phase segregation within the coating and diffusion across the coating-substrate interface. It changed the coating oxidation process from being driven by outward diffusion of Cr+ to one that is driven by inward penetration of O-, which could be explained by a complete suppression of Cr+ out diffusion and growth of Cr2O3 scales on the coating surface.
873	Atomic-scale investigation of fast oxidation kinetics of nanocrystalline CrMnFeNiCo thin films	Atom probe tomography was combined with transmission electron microscopy to characterize the oxidized structure of nanocrystalline CrMnFeNiCo thin films after exposure to air at 500{degree sign}C for 5 min. Mn and Cr oxide scales were observed on the surface of the sample, agreeing with literature reports on bulk samples. Depletion of Mn and Cr below the surface of the sample due to oxidation together with partial phase decomposition yield a FeCo-B2 phase. The fast oxidation of the nanocrystalline material was attributed to an enhanced outwards diffusion of Cr and Mn along grain boundaries and within the newly formed B2 phase.
874	Sensing and cooling of a nanomechanical resonator with en electron beam and a capacitive force	A model of the cooling properties of a nanocantilever by a free electron beam is presented for a capacitive interaction. The optimal parameters for position sensing and cooling applications are estimated from  previous experimental conditions. In particular, we demonstrate that a purely capacitive force can lower the temperature of a nanocantilever by several orders of magnitude in striking contrast with the conventional  electrostatic damping regime. We propose a step by step protocol to extract the interdependent parameters of the experiments. This work will aid for future developments of ultra sensitive force sensors in electron microscopes.
875	Magnetization reversal and magnetotransport properties of[Au/Co/Pd]n thin films and nanostructures	[Au (10 &Aring;)/Co (6.6 &Aring;)/Pd (10 &Aring;)]10 multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy have been grown by DC magnetron sputtering on silicon oxide substrates. Standard magnetometry and magnetic force microscopy imaging enable to extract the main magnetic parameters (saturation magnetization, anisotropy, domain size, exchange constant). The magnetoresistance and the extraordinary Hall effect of the material have been characterized using nanostructures patterned on the multilayer. Both the magnetization reversal mode and the magnetotransport properties are found to depend strongly on the nanowire width. The relatively low coercive field, the high anisotropy, and the possibility to control domain wall motion in sub-100 nm wires make this system an interesting alternative to Pt-based multilayers for spin-transfer torques experiments.
876	A BIMODAL THERANOSTIC NANODELIVERY SYSTEM BASED ON [GRAPHENE OXIDE-CHLOROGENIC ACID-GADOLINIUM/GOLD] NANOPARTICLES	A nanodelivery system based on graphene oxide, composed of a natural chemotherapeutic agent, chlorogenic acid (CA) and contrast agents, gadolinium (Gd) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CA and Gd were simultaneously loaded on the GO nanolayers using various chemical interactions to form GOGCA, and subsequently the AuNPs were doped on the surface of the GOGCA to form a bimodal theranostic nanodelivery system (BIT). The BIT developed was subjected to various characterizations. The cytotoxicity studies showed high efficacy in HepG2 cancer cells and null toxicity in the 3T3 normal cells. The BIT also showed positive MRI contrast.
877	Performance Enhancement of Planar Perovskite Solar Cells by Fullerene Doping with Silver Nanoparticles	Herein, we demonstrate p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells with the structure ITO/PEDOT/MAPbI<sub>3</sub>/PCBM/Ni:Au, where the PCBM electron extraction layer  (EEL)  was intentionally modified with variable amounts of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Small cross-section AgNPs placed at rear-part of the solar cell avoids the parasitic absorption of the nanoparticles which is the biggest barrier for plasmonic structures when acting as photocurrent enhancers. The addition of small amounts of AgNPs (e.g. 5 wt%) into the PCBM improved the overall reproducibility of the solar cell fabrication process and the main performance figures of merit after optimization. Plasmonic simulations suggest that any plasmonic-optical effects are relatively small compared to sample absorbance due to perovskite alone. It has been concluded that plasmonic-electrical effects play a major role in performance improvement. Therefore, the addition of small AgNP in low concentration to EEL layer account for higher J<sub>sc</sub>, V<sub>oc</sub> and FF as result of a better perovskite coverage by the EEL and an improved charge carrier collection as evidenced by morphological and electrical analysis.
878	<strong>Acoustic Signals Induced by </strong><strong>Pulsed Electric Field </strong><strong>for Therapy Monitoring </strong>	Acoustic signals induced by a pulsed electric field are used for electrotherapy monitoring in real-time. This technique relies on the fact that pulsed electric fields induce ephemeral and localized temperature rises, followed by rapid thermal expansion, which then induces acoustic waves that can be detected outside the body and used to monitor absorbed electric energy. An experimental system was designed and implemented, which consists of three major components: a pulsed electric field generator, an ultrasound receiver, and a data acquisition system. Details of the system design and signal detection are presented. Characterization of these nanosecond electric pulse (nsEP) induced acoustic signals reveals a strong peak at 462 kHz, corresponding to a pulse duration in the microseconds range. A linear relationship between the intensity of the applied electric field and the intensity of the acoustic signal has also been observed. This study demonstrates the feasibility of applying a new technique for real-time monitoring of electrotherapy performed <em>in situ</em> in a non-invasive manner in clinical applications.
879	Thermal recrystallization of short-range ordered WS<sub>2</sub> films	The integration of van-der-Waals materials in nanoelectronic devices requires the deposition of few-layered MX<sub>2</sub> films with excellent quality crystals covering a large area. In recent years, astonishing progress in the monolayer growth of WS<sub>2</sub> and MoS<sub>2</sub> was demonstrated, but multilayer growth resulted often in separated triangular or hexagonal islands. These polycrystalline films cannot fully employ the specific MX<sub>2</sub> properties since they are not connected in-plane to the other domains. To coalesce separated islands, ultra-high temperature post-deposition anneals in H<sub>2</sub>S are applied, which are not compatible with bare silicon substrates. Starting from the deposition of stoichiometric short-ordered films, the present work studies different options for subsequent high-temperature annealing in inert atmosphere to form crystalline films with large grains from stoichiometric films with small grains. The rapid thermal annealing (RTA), performed over a few seconds, is compared to excimer laser annealing (ELA) in the nanosecond range, which are both able to crystallize the thin WS<sub>2</sub>. The WS<sub>2</sub> recrystallization temperature can be lowered using metallic crystallization promoters (Co and Ni). The best result is obtained using a Co cap, due to the circumvention of Co and S binary phase-formation below the eutectic temperature. The recrystallization above a critical temperature is accompanied by sulfur-loss and 3D regrowth. These undesired effects can be suppressed by the application of a dielectric capping layer prior to annealing. A SiO<sub>2</sub> cap can suppress successfully the sulfur loss during annealing and reveals improved material quality in comparison to non-capped films.
880	<strong><em>ITO-Free Localized Surface Plasmon-Enhanced Transparent Conducting Electrode for High-Efficiency Light Emitting Diode</em></strong>	Transparent conducting electrodes (TCEs) are important components of high- efficiency light emitting diodes (LEDs). Metal nanowire such as silver nanowire (Ag NW) is widely studied as a promising candidate for replacement of indium tin oxide (ITO)-based TCEs in LEDs. However, the efficiency of LEDs with metal nanowire is inferior to that of LEDs with ITO. In this work, we demonstrate an ITO-free Ag NW-based localized surface plasmon (LSP)-enhanced transparent conducting electrode (TCE). To find a mechanism for improvement in LED efficiency through LSP-enhanced TCEs, internal quantum efficiency (IQE) by quantum well (QW)-LSP coupling and light extraction efficiency (LEE) by TM light&ndash;LSP coupling is studied by controlling the thickness of p-GaN. We found that the enhancement of IQE by QW-LSP coupling is dominant for InGaN-based blue LEDs. To optimize the efficiency of LEDs, we suggest the NW + NP-based TCEs, where NPs work as leak mode and scattering center. The efficiency of LEDs with Ag NW + NP-based TCE is increased by 20% compared to that of LEDs with only Ag NW.
881	Multi-scale electron microscopy of overnitrided Sm-Fe-Mn-N powder	Multi-scale electron microscopy technique that combines transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and focused ion beam - scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) was utilized to investigate the influences of the change in microstructure of Sm2(Fe0.95Mn0.05)17Nx by overnitridation on the magnetic properties. The recent high-contrast backscatter electron imaging technique in SEM machines enabled us to reveal the formation events of cell-like microstructure from a quite large field of view. In addition, detailed TEM observations revealed the crystallographic orientations of the cells as well as the local chemical fluctuation. The combination of these techniques allows us to understand the microstructural hierarchy in this material, verifying that the original orientations of the individual particles are inherited to the nanocrystalline cells formed by overnitridation.
882	Tunable Direct-Indirect Band Gaps of ZrSe<sub>2</sub> Nanoribbons	The atomic and electronic structures of armchair and zigzag  ZrSe<sub>2</sub>  nanoribbons have been investigated systematically. Both the armchair and zigzag  ZrSe<sub>2</sub>  nanoribbons are nonmagnetic semiconductors, while their band gaps show quite different behaviors depending on ribbon width. We find that all the zigzag ribbons possess direct energy gaps, which smoothly decline with the increasing ribbon width. On the other hand, energy gaps for the armchair ribbons change from direct gaps to indirect ones as the ribbon width increases, and exhibit a width-dependent oscillation behavior. Moreover, the semiconducting behaviors and the band gap types are robust, they remain unchanged in bilayer and  multilayered thin films with inter-layer interactions. These findings indicate that ZrSe<sub>2</sub> nanoribbons are promising candidate materials for applications in nanoelectronic devices.
883	<strong>Electricity-mediated plasmonic tip engineering on single Ag nanowire for SERS </strong>	An electricity-mediated plasmonic engineering was applied on a single Ag nanowire to engineer its tip for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Under this constant photoelectric field treatment, a significant sharpening of the tip and reduction of the surface fluctuation was observed for the Ag nanowire tip via in situ atomic force microscopy. A significant SERS signal enhancement was thus obtained after the tip engineering. The relevant dynamic mechanisms of the tip engineering, including the light-induced plasmonic phase transition and electrostatic force driven flow on the Ag nanowire tip are discussed in detail. It is expected that this type of tip engineering will greatly enhance the signal of single metal nanowire SERS probes and provide new insights into fabrication technologies for metal nanostructures.
884	<strong>Analysis of Nanomechanical Sensing Signals; Physical Parameter Estimation for Gas Identification</strong>	Nanomechanical sensors&mdash;emerging chemical sensors which detect changes in mechanical properties caused by gas sorption&mdash;have been attracting much attention owing to their high sensitivity and versatility. In the data analysis of sensing signals, empirically extracted signal features have been commonly employed to identify the gas species. Such an empiric approach cannot be optimized further without a solid guideline, resulting in a limited identification performance. Therefore, a new analytical protocol based on intrinsic physical properties of a target gas and a receptor material has been highly demanded. In this study, we have developed a parameter estimation protocol based on a theoretical model for a cantilever-type nanomechanical sensor coated with a viscoelastic material. This protocol provides a practical estimation method for intrinsic parameters, which can be used for gas identification. As a demonstration of gas identification based on intrinsic parameters, we focused on the time constant for gas diffusion , which reflects the physicochemical interaction between gas species and a receptor material. Based on  estimated from different receptor materials, we succeeded in the identification of solvent vapors. This parameter estimation protocol not only enables the gas identification based on the intrinsic property of target gases, but also provides a scientific guideline for the selection and optimization of receptor materials for nanomechanical sensors.
885	On-demand single photon generation via quantum interference in a &Chi;<sup>(2)</sup> nonlinear nanocavity	A scalable on-chip single photon source at telecom wavelength is essential in quantum communication networks. In this work we numerically construct an on-demand single photon source based on an optical parametric amplifier in a photonic crystal nanocavity. Under the condition of pulsed excitation, we study photon statistics of the source by the Monte Carlo wave function method. The results show that there exits an optimal excitation pulse width for generating high purity single photons, while the source brightness monotonously increases with the increasing of the excitation pulse width.
886	Optimal measurements of a microwire's flexural vibrations using micro-lens optical fiber interferometer	Optical interferometer has been utilized as powerful tools in studying vibrations of a nano/micro-mechanical resonator - an essential ingredient for ultrasensitive detection of small mass, force, displacement. Conventional optical fiber interferometer setup adopts light interference effect only. When a microwire mechanical resonator vibrates along a direction away from the optical axis, the interference signal will be not optimal for the measurements of such vibration. In this work, we theoretically analyze optimal measurements of a microwire's vibrations using micro-lens optical fiber interferometer, where we take both interference and scattering effect of light interacting with a microwire into account. Then, on a home-built micro-lens optical fiber optics system, we confirmed our analysis by measuring a microwire that was driven in varies directions regarding to the optical axis. Our result shows that detection sensitivity can be optimized for a microwire that vibrates in arbitrary directions. The result is also useful in studying flexural vibration modes of a microwire and their applications in vectorial force detections.
887	<strong>Biocompatibility Enhancement of Graphene Oxide-Silver Nanocomposite by Functionalization with Polyvinylpyrrolidone</strong>	The promising graphene-based materials sheets hold a great potential for biological applications owing to its unique properties and relatively low cost. Thus their antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility need the light to be thrown on. This work highlights the importance of functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) sheets using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and decorating them with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in order to enhance their antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility. Decoration of the surface of GO and FGO sheets with AgNPs was carried out easily since GO and FGO sheets can act as stabilizing agent for NPs. The structural and morphological characterizations were performed by UV-Visible, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), and Raman Spectroscopic techniques, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM). The antimicrobial activities of the prepared samples against Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi were studied. The cytotoxicity and cell viability of prepared materials were tested against BJ1 normal skin fibroblasts. The results indicated that the decoration with AgNPs showed a significant increase in the antimicrobial activity of GO and FGO sheets, and functionalization of GO sheets and GO-Ag nanocomposite with PVP improved the cell viability by about 40% and 35%, respectively.
888	Wetting characteristics  of vertically aligned graphene nanosheets	The change in water contact angle  (from 103o to 135o) with vertically aligned  graphene nanosheets, as a function of change in the surface geometry, is analysed. Theoretical calculations and comparison with the experimental data shows that the apparent contact angle values of VAGNS are closer to that of fully non-wetting mode or ideal Cassie mode of wetting. Ideal Cassie mode of wetting also explains the variation of the water contact angle of VAGNS with surface morphology of the material and predicts how surface parameters can be modified to get a required wettability for a certain application of this material.
889	<strong>Linear-field plasma jet arrays excited by high-voltage alternating current and nanosecond pulses</strong>	Atmospheric pressure plasma jet arrays can expand the treatment dimension of a single jet to large scales effectively, and the arrays with a good downstream uniformity have a great potential for applications in materials surface treatment and biomedicine. In this paper, a linear-field jet array with a ring-ring electrode structure in Ar is excited by alternating current (AC) and nanosecond (ns) pulse voltage, and the characteristics and downstream uniformity of the array and their dependence on the applied voltage and gas flow rate are investigated and compared through optical, electrical and Schlieren diagnosis. The electrical and hydrodynamic interactions between the jets in the array are analyzed and discussed. The results show that the ns pulse excited jet arrays can generate relatively large-scale plasma with better uniformity, longer plumes and higher intensity active species with a higher energy efficiency than the AC excited ones. No visible deviation of the plume and gas flow trajectories in the light emission and Schlieren images is observed for the ns pulse excited arrays. On the other hand, deviation of plume trajectories is shown to depend on the applied voltage and gas flow rate for the AC excited arrays. The better uniformity of ns pulse excited jet arrays is due to the effective suppression of hydrodynamic and electrical interactions among the jets in the arrays with a ns pulse applied voltage, which induces a lower gas temperature and limits of the cumulative effect of repetitive Coulomb force compared with the AC excitation case.
890	<strong>Response to &ldquo;Comment on &lsquo;Excellent field emission properties of VO<sub>2</sub>(A) nanogap emitters in air&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong>	This is a short response to a comment (APL18-CR-02110)about our recent paper in Applied Physics Letters (MS # APL18-CR-02110).
891	Enhanced light coupling into periodic arrays of nanoscale semiconducting fins.	In this paper, we study experimentally and theoretically the light coupling into periodic arrays of nanoscale semiconducting fins among others to explain its enhancement when increasing the fin pitch, i.e. the spatial periodicity. With Raman spectroscopy on Si fin arrays, we show the enhancement of the light coupling into the fins in arrays of increasing pitch. We prove that this enhancement is due to the excitation of an electromagnetic mode, which is confined and guided inside the fins, and is more efficiently excited as the pitch increases. Finally, we propose a quantitative analytical model describing the physical mechanism responsible for the light coupling into nanoscale semiconducting fins arranged into periodic arrays of narrow sub-50 nm pitch.
892	<strong>Fabrication and manipulation of nanopillars using electron induced excitation</strong>	This work demonstrates the successful fabrication and in-situ manipulation of nanopillars made of Pt-C composite by means of electron induced bending (EIB) inside a dual beam scanning electron microscope system. Indeed, controlled maneuvering of nanostructures has been of great interest because of its wide possible applications in nanotechnology. Here, Pt-C nanopillars were fabricated and used as building blocks for several nanostructures such as self-assembled nano-cage, nano-switches, nano-grabber, etc. EIB is found to be an efficient way to drive the fabricated nanopillars to yield to different nano-devices. The optimized conditions for EIB manipulation in terms of energy and dose are determined experimentally and Monte Carlo simulations. The suggested mechanisms responsible for the nanopillars response are discussed and they seem to be directly linked to the phase transformation from inherent amorphous phase to crystalline structure of C-Pt. This all-in-one fabrication and manipulation offered by the EIB showed an easy way and low cost in designing 3D nanostructures to be considered for various applications that can be applied to a wide range of metallic/non-metallic structures. Moreover, EIB can be scaled up to mass maneuvering process and extended to other nanoscale structures
893	The single-line-of-sight, time-resolved x-ray imager diagnostic on OMEGA	The single-line-of-sight, time-resolved x-ray imager (SLOS-TRXI) on OMEGA is one of a new generation of fast-gated x-ray cameras comprising an electron pulse-dilation imager and a nanosecond-gated, burst-mode, hybrid complementary metal-oxide semiconductor sensor. SLOS-TRXI images the core of imploded cryogenic deuterium-tritium shells in inertial confinement fusion experiments in the ~4- to 9-keV photon energy range with a pinhole imager onto a photocathode. The diagnostic is mounted on a fixed port almost perpendicular to a 16 channel, framing-camera-based, time-resolved Kirkpatrick-Baez microscope, providing a second time-gated line of sight for hot-spot imaging on OMEGA. SLOS-TRXI achieves ~40-ps temporal resolution and better than 10-&#x03BC;m spatial resolution. Shots with neutron yields of up to 1 &#x00D7; 10^14 were taken without observed neutron-induced background signal. The implosion images from SLOS-TRXI show the evolution of the stagnating core.
894	A strong saddle-shaped surface-to-volume ratio effect on the Young&rsquo;s modulus of silicon nanotubes	Single crystalline silicon nanotubes (NTs) along [001] direction with different outer diameters and wall thicknesses have been successfully prepared via high-fidelity nanofabrication process by combining electron-beam lithography and reactive-ion etching method, achieving a higher specific surface-to-volume ratio compared with other solid one dimensional (1-D) nanomaterials. <em>In situ</em> compression results indicated that the strength of NT increases when the outer diameter decreases with constant wall thickness, but decreases with the decrease of the wall thickness with constant outer diameter. The ultimate strain is over 20% and the maximum strength is almost 16 GPa, approaching the theoretical strength of silicon. More importantly, a strong saddle-shaped surface-to-volume ratio effect on the Young&rsquo;s modulus has been revealed. The Young&rsquo;s modulus increases to a peak at surface-to-volume ratio value of 0.04 nm<sup>-1</sup> and then decreases at higher surface-to-volume ratio. A single core with double shells model was proposed to interpret this unique saddle-shaped surface-to-volume ratio effect on the Young&rsquo;s modulus, which may play a guiding role in designing the nanoscale objects for device applications.
895	Synthesis of CdS nanoparticle by sol-gel method as low temperature NO2 sensor	In the present work, NO2 gas sensor based on Cadmium sulphide (CdS) nanostructures were prepared by using the chemical route technique. CdS thin film of different thickness were prepared by spin coating technique with different speed (1000, 2000 and 3000 rpm). Prepared thin films were characterized using different techniques, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Ultraviolet-Visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), which offered the information about the chemical structure and morphology of CdS thin film. Gas sensing measurements for detecting 20 ppm NO2 gas were carried out on CdS thin film prepared on interdigital electrodes patterned corning glass substrate and a maximum response  of ~1.73&#x00D7;102 at 70 {degree sign}C operating temperature was observed.
896	Ultrafast electron solvation in room temperature ionic liquid observed by femtosecond time-resolved near-IR spectroscopy	The solvation process of electrons generated by femtosecond UV excitation in pure room-temperature ionic liquid N, N, N-trimethyl-n-propylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide, [N<sub>1113</sub><sup>+</sup>][NTf<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>], was directly observed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with near-IR probe in the range 0.80 eV - 1.30 eV. A broad band centered at 1.12 eV, which is assigned to the solvated electrons, formed within the instrument response time after the UV photoirradiation at 5.17 eV. This broad band showed continuously blue-shifted of 0.09 eV within one nanosecond. The continuous blue-shift indicates clearly that the solvation process of electron in this ionic liquid proceeds in a continuous way. The peak shift kinetics is represented by a stretched exponential decay function, indicating the presence of two or more distinctively different solvation environments in this ionic liquid.
897	Modeling and characterization of surface roughness effect on fluid flow in a PDMS microchannel using a fractal based hybrid lattice Boltzmann method	In micro and nano flows, the fluid flow pattern is sensitive to many intrinsic parameters such as surface rough-<br />ness. In this letter, we have presented the capture of variations in fluid flow in Polydimethylsiloxane(PDMS)<br />microfluidic channels with respect to surface roughness. The velocity of the fluid is measured experimentally<br />and also simulated using a hybrid mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). For simulations, the surface<br />roughness is implemented using a fractal based approach. The Weierstrass-Mandelbrot(WM) mathematical<br />function is explored for realizing various rough surfaces by tuning the fractal dimension parameter. The re-<br />sults show that the computational fluid dynamics model, which incorporated surface roughness, has a better<br />agreement with the experimental results than the model without roughness.
898	Bimetal Seleno-Sulfide CuNiSeS Nanosheet Catalyst for Methylene Blue Degradation in the Dark	To overcome the photocatalytic degradation reaction with the need of light excitation, the exploration of catalyst for the organic degradation reaction without light has become one of the core challenges in catalysis and pollution control. Here we report a novel CuNiSeS nanosheet catalyst with a hexagonal structure by a feasible preparation method. The structure and composition of CuNiSeS were well characterized by X-ray diffractometry and electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry, respectively. The result indicated that the best CuNiSeS-2 of 25 mg displayed excellent activity even in the dark to complete the degradation of 100 ml MB solution of 10 ppm within 5 min. This catalyst also performed relatively good stability and durability for the reusability tests. The reasons for the fast MB degradation in the dark were investigated and the reaction kinetic mechanism was proposed.
899	<strong>Enhancement in Device Memory by inserting an Insulator layer in Lead free Ferroelectric film for Non-Volatile Memory Applications</strong>	We report the structural and electrical properties of Al/SBN/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Silicon gate stack for non-volatile memory applications. RF magnetron sputtering was used for thin film deposition of SrBi<sub>2</sub>Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and their stack on the silicon substrate. Structural characterization using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) show the perovskite structure of SBN film annealed in the temperature range of 500-800<sup>0</sup>C. Multiple angle ellipsometric analysis carried out on the deposited film annealed at different temperatures shows the refractive index (n) in the range of 2.0941 to 2.1804 for the SBN and 1.7-1.73 for sputtered Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Metal-Ferroelectric-Semiconductor (MFeS), Metal-Ferroelectric-Metal (MFeM) and Metal-Ferroelectric-Insulator-Semiconductor (MFeIS) structures were fabricated to investigate the memory window, leakage current density, hysteresis and fatigue characteristics. The Effect of introducing Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> buffer layer, its thickness and its annealing temperature on the structural and electrical properties were investigated. The capacitance-voltage (C-V) data shows the memory window improvement from 1.977 V for MFeS to 2.88 V for MFeIS structure with 10 nm sputtered Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>buffer layer.

900	<strong>Probing the dimerization and refractive index of gold nanoparticle in HeLa cells using single particle spectroscopy</strong>	<strong>Fluorescence based non-destructive, non-invasive high-resolution imaging had been extensively used to visualize living cells without the use of any contrasting agent to track or analyze biological molecules or interactions. However, due to photo bleaching and photo blinking properties of fluorophore, an alternative technique founded on plasmonic nanoparticle based single molecule detection and single molecule spectroscopy has received much interest to monitor the dimerization, to probe the </strong><strong>intracellular refractive index (RI) of gold nanoparticles (AuNP) inside biological cells and to determine biomolecular interaction.</strong>s<p><strong>In this manuscript, we performed a systematic in-depth study to identify the single particle and dimer form of gold nanoparticle (AuNP) embedded in PVA matrix using confocal laser scattering microscopy which has been extended further to identify the dimerization, intracellular refractive index (RI) and biomolecular interaction inside living cells using the hyperspectral imaging and darkfield scattering microscopy. Moreover, we demonstrated a direct more accurate method compared to previously reported indirect measurement which is based on ensemble of AuNPs to identify the single particle and dimer and intracellular RI. In conclusion, these findings will provide a new insight in monitoring cellular dynamics and tracking the targeted nanoparticles within live cells, enabling us to use plasmonic nanoparticles as an intracellular biosensor.</strong>
901	<strong>Optical addressing of nanomechanical metamaterials with subwavelength resolution</strong>	Metamaterials that offer &ldquo;on-demand&rdquo; control of individual metamolecules are termed &ldquo;randomly accessible metamaterials&rdquo;. They can be useful for manipulating the wavefront of electromagnetic radiation, tailoring of the nearfield, and ultimately for multichannel data processing. Here we demonstrate how light can be used to actuate individual metamaterial elements on demand. Selectivity is achieved by constructing the metamaterial from nanomechanical elements that are designed to have slightly different mechanical resonance frequencies. Actuation is controlled by modulation of the optical control signal at the mechanical resonance frequencies of targeted elements, providing an all-optical route to randomly accessible metamaterials with spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit.
902	Light-Trapping Front Textures for Solar Cells made from a Tailored Mixture of Nanospheres	We report on highly efficient anti-reflection textures for solar cells that allow a fabrication using a two-step bottom-up approach. Hereby, nanospheres of tailored sizes are deposited as a monolayer on a substrate and the resulting height profile is used as a template for structuring the silicon surface. By applying these textures to crystalline silicon solar cells, we numerically show that such interfaces provide excellent broadband suppression of reflection while also enhancing the effective path-length through oblique-angle scattering into the medium. Reflectance values around 5% can be reached and sustained for incident angles up to 40&deg;. The absorption in the crystalline silicon layer reaches values that are comparable to the case of a Lambertian front texture. Considering the simplicity and low costness of the approach, these textures may serve as a promising alternative to other often used anti-reflection textures, especially for large-scale devices.
903	<strong>Direct modulation of a single InP/InAs nano-wire light-emitting diode</strong>	Telecom-band single nanowire (NW) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on silicon platforms are promising for use as future on-chip light sources. To realize such an LED, we grew p-i-n junction InP/InAs NWs by the vapor-liquid-solid method and used them to fabricate single NW-LED composites on Si wafers. Using a micro-photoluminescence system and current injection probe setup, we were able to estimate the optical and electrical properties. In addition, we demonstrated the dynamic signal modulation capabilities of our device through a digital eye diagram with a pseudorandom binary sequence signal. This telecom-band single nanowire LED using Gbps signal modulation has the potential for use as an on-chip light source.
904	<strong>Fabrication, characterization and hydrogen gas sensing performance of nanostructured V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> thin films prepared by plasma focus method</strong>	Nanocrystalline V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> thin films were deposited on glass substrates at room temperature using a low energy (1.3 kJ) plasma focus device. The effect of number of shots on the structural, morphological and hydrogen gas sensing properties of V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> films has been investigated using different methods. The structural properties and phase composition of the films were studied by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman scattering analysis. The results obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyzes indicated that the size of nanoparticles/agglomerates and surface roughness of V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> films strongly depend on number of shots. The variation in the gas response of the films for 1000 ppm concentration of hydrogen gas at different operating temperatures (150 <sup>o</sup>C &ndash; 350 <sup>o</sup>C) revealed an optimal operating temperature of 275<sup>o</sup>C. Moreover, among all the V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> films studied, the sample deposited with 10 shots showed the maximum gas response to various H<sub>2</sub> concentrations at optimal operating temperature.
905	Quantifying Hg(II) ions in solution and bound to Insulin by robust gold nanoclusters	Gold Nanoclusters (Au NCs) synthesized within a protein (human serum albumin) template exhibited intense red luminescence accompanied with a quantum yield &gt;10% and remarkable photo and cluster-core stability for a prolonged period (more than a year). These photoluminescent NCs were resistant to chemical and thermal perturbations but were found to breakdown and exhibit selectivity and high sensitivity for the detection of mercury (II) ions. From application point-of-view, the synthesized Au NCs were efficient to quantify the mercury ions bound to the hormone, Insulin. Interestingly, by exploiting the auto-fluorescence of these protein templated Au NCs, it was demonstrated successfully for the first time that Au/HSA NCs were able to sense Hg(II) ions at single molecule sensitivity using Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy highlighting a detection limit in the sub-nanomolar regime.
906	<strong>Optical and Mechanical Properties of the Double-layer Diamond-like Carbon Film Prepared by Double Laser Beams</strong>	On the soft and easy-corrosive silicon window, double-layer diamond-like carbon film was designed and prepared: the inner oxygen-doped DLC layer deposited by femto-sencond laser in the oxygen atmosphere was taken as the infrared anti-reflective layer because of its low refractive index and high transmission, and then the outer pure DLC layer deposited by nano-second laser in the high vacuum was taken as the protective layer based on its high hardness and corrosion resistance. The extreme different properties of the atomic bonds, microscopic structure and optical properties between the pure and oxygen-doped diamond-like carbon films were researched, and different thickness ratios of the two layers in the double-layer film were tried to balance the anti-reflective effect against the protective effect. The tests showed that nanohardness and transmission in the medium infrared band of the samples increased and decreased respectively when thickness of the outer pure DLC layer increased. The pure DLC layer was proved nice corrosion resistance by the corrosion tests, and it must be some thick to prevent the alkaline solution effectively from soaking into the deep-seated depth to corrupt the inner oxygen-doped DLC layer.
907	<strong>Tin-Vacancy in Diamond for Luminescent Thermometry</strong>	Color centers in diamond have shown promising potential for luminescent thermometry. So far, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center has demonstrated a high sensitivity for optical temperature monitoring in biological systems. However, the NV center requires microwave excitation which can cause unwanted heating, and the NV is also sensitive to non-axial magnetic fields, both of which can result in inaccurate temperature measurements. To overcome this drawback, silicon-vacancy (SiV) and germanium-vacancy (GeV) color centers in diamond have recently shown good optical temperature sensitivity via by the temperature shift of their optical zero-phonon line wavelengths. Here we report optical temperature measurements using the recently discovered tin-vacancy (SnV) color center in diamond, and show sensitivity better than 0.2<sup>o</sup>K in 10 s integration time. Also, we compare the relative merits of SnV with respect to SiV and GeV for luminescent thermometry. These results illustrate that there are likely many future options for nanoscale thermometry using diamonds.
908	<strong>Study of the adhesion and friction drag on the rough hydrophobic surface: sandblasting aluminum</strong>	Roughness is a crucial prerequisite for fabricating the superhydrophobic surface. However, due to the enormous economic costs for fabricating the rough surfaces, it seriously prevents application of the superhydrophobic surface in life. In this paper, we presented an uncomplicated, low cost, friendly quick method to fabricate the rough surface with micro- and nanostructured features. Through changing the sandblasting pressure, we fabricated the different roughness surfaces on the aluminum sheets, which were then decorated with the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to reduce the surface energy. As a result, the contact angle, slip velocity, slip length and drag reduction ratio increased with the increase of sandblasting pressure, and the maximum contact angle with droplet, slip velocity, length and drag reduction ratio was 151.74&plusmn;1&deg;, 0.1617 m/s, 0.04276 mm and 19.2 % at the sandblasting pressure 0.8 MPa, respectively. The adhesive force of the samples decreased with the sandblasting pressure increase, the minimum of which was 0.096 mN. The process of entrapped air escaped from the samples surface, which was visualized by fluent software. Results showed that the lowly adhesive and lowly frictional property of the superhydrophobic surface, originating from their ability to entrapped air into the space between the protrusions, which could effectively avert the water moving into the space.
909	Calibration sample and related method for wide-range resistance measurements with a conducting probe Atomic Force Microscope	A specialized sample for a direct calibration of resistance measurements by conducting probe Atomic Force Microscope is presented. Combined with an adapted operating method, it enables to test any commercial or home-made current-sensing device proposed for these microscopes in a wide resistance range covering ten decades. This contribution is thought as a first step towards easier, best-mastered quantitative electrical measurements at nanoscale.
910	Electromagnetic proximity effect in planar superconductor-ferromagnet structures	The spread of the Cooper pairs into the ferromagnet in proximity<br />coupled superconductor - ferromagnet (SF) structures is shown to cause a<br />strong inverse electromagnetic phenomenon, namely, the long-range transfer of<br />the magnetic field from the ferromagnet to the superconductor. Contrary to the<br />previously investigated inverse proximity effect resulting from the spin<br />polarization of superconducting surface layer, the characteristic length of<br />the above inverse electrodynamic effect is of the order of the London<br />penetration depth, which usually much larger than the superconducting<br />coherence length. The corresponding spontaneous currents appear even in the<br />absence of the stray field of the ferromagnet and are generated by the<br />vector-potential of magnetization near the S/F interface and they should be taken into account at the design of the nanoscale S/F devices. Similarly to the well-known Aharonov-Bohm effect, the discussed phenomenon can be viewed as a new<br />manifestation of the role of vector potential in quantum physics.
911	Driving useful morphological changes in magnetic nanoparticle structures through the application of acoustic waves and magnetic fields	The growing interest in acoustic manipulation of particles in micro to nanofluidics using surface acoustic waves, together with the many applications of magnetic nanoparticles---whether individual or in arrays---underpins our discovery of how these forces can be used to rapidly, easily, and irreversibly form 1D chains and 2D films. These films and chains are difficult to produce by other methods yet offer many advantages over suspensions of individual nanoparticles by making use of the scale of the structures formed, 10 nm to 10 &micro;m, and by taking a balance of the relevant external and interparticle forces, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the phenomena become apparent.<br />For loosely-connected 1D chains, the magnetic field alone is sufficient, though applying an acoustic field drives a topology change to interconnected loops of ~10&ndash;100 particles. Increasing the acoustic field intensity drives a transition from these looped structures to dense 2D arrays via interparticle Bjerknes forces. Inter-particle drainage of the surrounding fluid leaves these structures intact after removal of the externally applied forces. The self-evident morphology transitions depend solely upon the relative amplitudes of the Brownian, Bjerknes, and magnetic forces.
912	<strong>Non-regular hexagonal 2D - Carbon: an allotrope of graphene</strong><strong>- A First principle study</strong>	Recently there has been a tremendous research activity in the area of sp2 carbon-based nanostructures. This research has led to a number of fundamental discoveries in materials physics and their applications. Theoretical and computational modelling has been playing an important role in this field. In a first principle study, using density functional theory, we have identified three types of  2D carbon sheets, made entirely of non-regular hexagons. In one case we get a system where the non regular hexagons have two sides same length (<em>d</em><sub>1</sub>=1.416&Aring;) and four sides same length (<em>d</em><sub>2</sub>=1.68&Aring;). In another two cases the non regular hexagons have three pairs (opposite sides) of different lengths (<em>d</em><sub>1</sub>=1.529&Aring;, <em>d</em><sub>2</sub>=1.567&Aring; d <em>d</em><sub>3</sub> = 1.612&Aring; ; <em>d</em><sub>1</sub>=1.387&Aring;, <em>d</em><sub>2</sub>=1.348&Aring; and <em>d</em><sub>3</sub> = 1.387&Aring;) as their opposite sides. By propper choice of  the non-regular hexagon sides one could arrive at a 2D carbon systemDue similar to graphene, but with a tunable band gap. The structure is more stable when the system has  more number of regular C-C bonds  than the longer C-C bonds. Due to its non-regular hexagons - special atomic configuration, this system may have, like graphene,  unusual properties. It is semiconducting and  there is no need to functionalize it for opening the band gap as is the case with graphene
913	Pyrolysis-induced shrinking of three-dimensional structures fabricated by two-photon polymerization: Experiment and theoretical model	Suspended carbon nanowires were fabricated by pyrolysis of photoresist microstructures written using two-photon polymerization (TPP). Upon pyrolysis, the TPP photoresist microwires exhibited shrinkage by as much as 72%, resulting in predominantly carbon microstructures, as confirmed by energy dispersive spectroscopy. The linewidth of the carbon nanowires ranged from 400 nm to 800 nm and was found to be dependent on the TPP exposure parameters, even after the thermal decomposition induced by the pyrolysis step. Furthermore, we present a theoretical model that describes the dependence of the feature size of the carbon structures on the TPP fabrication parameters. It is expected that this model can be extended to analyze and optimize other micro/nano-carbon geometries
914	<strong>Development and characterization of a wire-plate air bubbling plasma for wastewater treatment </strong><strong>using nanosecond pulsed high voltage </strong>	Upscaling plasma-based reactors is one of the challenges for implementing this technology to treat large volumes of wastewater. This study is aimed at developing a prototype reactor that can be easily scaled up for wastewater treatment using a wire-plate air bubbling plasma. The electrical characteristics of the developed reactor were deeply investigated at different operating parameters and solution conductivities. The performance of the reactor was examined on the basis of energy efficiency and methylene blue (MB) decoloration efficiency. Moreover, the impact of the treatment process on the TOC and the physicochemical properties, including the pH, the conductivity and the temperature of the treated solution was assessed. The analysis of current discharge and average power consumed showed that the discharge behaved like dielectric barrier discharge, where streamer was the mode of discharge. Interestingly, the solution conductivity had no effect on the average power consumed at a low applied voltage, due to the confining of the discharge in a small area around the discharge electrode in the gas phase. However, at a relatively high voltage, the effect of conductivity on the average power consumed was noticeable, yet it had no effect on the decoloration efficiency at the same average power. The present reactor showed a high energy efficiency value of 42 g/kWh at 50% decoloration of 30 mg/L MB solution, but it dropped to 14 g/kWh at 97% decoloration. A first-order kinetics model described well the decoloration reaction rates and the overall rate constant, correlated linearly to the average power.
915	<strong>Structural instability and dynamic fluctuations in ZnO random lasers </strong>	We report experimental results on the structural stability of optically pumped zinc oxide random lasers. We find that the lasing threshold is not entirely stable and depends on the accumulated light exposure received in pulsed optical pumping. We show that an accumulated exposure below ~1 J improves the lasing efficiency and lowers the threshold. Beyond that value, however, lasing efficiency and threshold begin to degrade. Electron microscopy shows that the degradation is accompanied by morphological changes characteristic of melting. These changes become visible at exposures of ~0.5 J. We suggest that the melting initially remains localized within nanometer areas and that the initial improvement is due to defect annealing. For exposures &gt;1 J the melting zones connect leading to deterioration. The findings mostly affect random lasers used in the incoherent lasing regime.  If stable output from ZnO random lasers is desired, a lower lasing thresholds or higher damage threshold are needed.
916	High-frequency measurements of thermophysical properties of thin films using a modified broad-band frequency domain thermoreflectance approach	In this work we present the implementation of a new method to perform high-frequency thermoreflectance measurements on thin films. The so-called Differential Broad-Band Frequency Domain Thermoreflectance (DBB-FDTR) method follows BB-FDTR developed previously [Rev. Sci. Instrum. 84, 064901 (2013)], without the use of expensive electro-optic modulators. Two techniques are introduced to recover the thermal phase of interest and to separate it from the unwanted instrumental contributions to the recorded phase. Measuring a differential thermal phase by either varying the spot size or offsetting the pump and probe beams, the thermophysical properties of materials can be extracted. This approach enables the study of nanoscale heat transport where non-equilibrium phenomena are dominating.
917	A DPM hybrid continuum-atomistic model for electrokinetics in nanofluidics	The ever-growing field of micro and nanotechnology has a great deal of interest in simulating dynamic phenomena of multiscale systems. Hybrid approaches that produce a trade-off between accuracy and computational costs play a key role in this area. In this study, an improved hybrid continuum-atomistic model is proposed for the simulation of electroosmotic flows in nanochannels. The aqueous solvent phase is modeled by the continuum four-way coupled Navier-Stokes equations while a Lagrangian approach is used for the ion transport. Different forces, including the drag, buoyancy, Brownian, electrostatic, and ion-ion/wall-ion collision, and torques, including the drag and collision, govern the motion of the ion particles. The ion-ion/wall-ion collision is taken into account by a Discrete Phase Model (DPM) and the electric field is derived by the Poisson-Boltzmann closure. The results of the model, such as the change of bulk velocity with the surface electric charge density, are validated by several molecular dynamics simulations and experimental observations available in the literature. It is shown that the present hybrid model is capable of predicting the main features of the problem. Moreover, the significance of different forces and the other alternative for modeling the external electric field, i.e. the discrete Coulomb&rsquo;s approach with the Modified Particle Mesh Ewald boundary treatment, are also examined. The proposed model would be extremely useful for future studies on the electrokinetics in nanochannels, esp. in more complex geometries where the MD approaches are limited due to the computational costs.
918	Full-wave theory for WGM lasing of fully anisotropic nanoparticles beyond visible	A full-wave theory for the prediction of the complex whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) resonances beyond visible, of fully anisotropic nano/microresonators, is presented. The theory is based on the volume integral equation (VIE) method, supported by appropriate perturbation theory which enables analytical closed-form expressions valid for extremely large indices of the involved spherical wavefunctions. These closed-form expressions allow for the instant computation of the eigenbasis required for the solution of the VIE. The theory is applied to the calculation of WGM spectra of uniaxial semiconductor crystals beyond visible, to gyroelectric magnetic garnets, and to geometrical birefringence (GB) enhancement due to large Verdet constants. Combined with a state-of-the-art open-source algorithm for complex roots computation, this theory constitutes a rigorous tool for the interpretation of experimental data obtained from photonic and optomagnonic applications, including WGM lasing of fully anisotropic nanoparticles and magneto-optical (MO) coupling.
919	Optimized nanocrystalline silicon oxide emitter and back surface field for silicon heterojunction solar cells	In this work, a p-type (boron-doped) wide-gap hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon oxide (p-nc-SiO<sub>x</sub>:H) as an emitter window layer was investigated for silicon heterojunction solar cell applications. We present a p-type nc-SiO<sub>x</sub>:H material with a &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; type structure (p-&mu;c-Si:H/p-nc-SiO<sub>x</sub>:H/p-&mu;c-Si:H). The P-&mu;c-Si:H on top of the p-nc-SiO<sub>x</sub>:H improves the p-emitter/n-type Transparent Conducting Oxide (TCO) contact and enhances the built-in electric field of the P-N junction. The P-&mu;c-Si:H under the p-nc-SiO<sub>x</sub>:H serves as the seeding layer and enhances the initial nucleation of the emitter. A higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) response and fill factor of the solar cells can be achieved using the novel p-type nc-SiO<sub>x</sub>:H material. In addition, the use of n-type (phosphorus-doped) nc-SiO<sub>x</sub>:H as the back surface field (BSF) of the solar cell further improves the fill factor. A solar cell with a conversion efficiency of 19.76% and current density of 40.2 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> was obtained.
920	Time-dependent interfacial thermal resistance for transient ballistic-diffusive heat transport	Interfaces play an important role in nanoscale thermal transport. However, more attention are paid to interfacial thermal resistance (ITR) in steady state conditions, leaving that in transient cases still less understood. In this work, ballistic heat wave propagation through bilayer nanofilms is simulated as a representative transient phonon ballistic-diffusive transport using phonon Monte Carlo method. It is found that ITR in transient ballistic-diffusive heat transport is not constant, but changes over time instead. The significant time dependence is caused by time-dependent angle distribution of phonons scattered at interface, i.e. degree of non-equilibrium of phonons at interface in wave vector space, and that contribution to ITR differs for phonons impinging on interface with different angels. A theoretical model based on weighted sum of angles of phonons scattered at interface is derived to well describe the time-dependent ITR. Also, Minimum ITR is predicted when phonon initial emission direction is vertical to the boundary and phonon transport is then in completely ballistic regime. This work is expected to promote understanding on ITR and help to guide heat transport through interface.
921	New candidates for the global minimum of medium-sized silicon clusters: A hybridsDFTB/DFT genetic algorithm applied to Si<sub>n</sub>, n = 8-80	In this study, we perform a systematic search to find the possible lowest energy structure of silicon nanoclusters Si<sub> n</sub> (n = 8-80) by means of an evolutionary algorithm. The fitness function for this search is the total energy of density functional tight binding (DFTB). To be on firm ground, we take several low energy structures of DFTB and perform further geometrical optimization by density functional theory (DFT). Then we choose structures with the lowest DFT total energy and compare them with the reported lowest energy structures in the literature. In our search, we found several lowest energy structures that were previously unreported. We further observe a geometrical transition at n = 27 from elongated to globular structures. In addition, the optical gap of the lowest energy structures is investigated by time-dependent DFTB (TD-DFTB) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT). The results show the same trend in TD-DFTB and TD-DFT for the optical gap. Wesalso find a sudden drop in the optical gap at n = 27, precisely where the geometrical transition occurs.
922	Metastable vortex-like polarization textures in ferroelectric nanoparticles of different shapes and sizes	The dependence of the polarization textures topology in dielectric matrix embedded ferroelectric PbTiO3 nanoparticles on the particle shape and size was investigated with a time-dependent Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach combined with coupled-physics finite-element-method based simulations. Particle shapes belonging to the superellipsoidal family were probed, including octahedral, cubic and intermediate geometries. For each shape, a parametric sweep of particle sizes ranging from 2 to 40 nm was conducted, revealing a general trend for the texture transformations from a monodomain, through a vortex-like, to a multidomain state, as the size increases. Critical particle sizes for the texture instabilities were found to be strongly dependent on the particle shape, with octahedral particles undergoing transitions at much larger volumes, compared to the cubic particles. Furthermore, for all the considered non-spherical shapes of appropriate size, it was possible to align the paraelectric polar-vortex cores with every rotational axis of the particle point symmetry group. The shape-dependent metastability of the vortex-like textures opens up new avenues for controlling polarization at the nanoscale in a variety of technological applications.
923	Room Temperature Ferromagnetic Resonance in Hetero-Epitaxial $BTO-BFO/LSMO$ Magnetoelectric Composite	We observed small Gilbert damping ($\alpha=$0.004) and the absence of large inhomogeneous broadening, in a film with 80 nm thickness of BTO-BFO on LSMO (110). This fact offers opportunities for employing this material system for spin transfer in multifunctional materials where controlling magnetization by a flow of spin angular momentum, or spin current, is crucial toward developing nanoscale spin-based memory and devices. Magnetic insulators, such as BTO-BFO on LSMO, are potentially excellent candidates for pure spin current without the existence of charge current.
924	<strong>A bottom-up approach for controlled deformation of </strong><strong>carbon nanotubes through blistering of supporting substrate surface</strong>	Tuning the band structure and, in particular, gap opening in 1D and 2D materials through their deformation is a promising approach for their application in modern semiconductor devices. However, there is an essential breach between existing laboratory scale methods applied for deformation of low-dimensional materials and the needs of large-scale production. In this work, we propose a novel method which is potentially well compatible with high end technological application: single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) first deposited on the flat surface of a supporting wafer, which has been pre-implanted with H<sup>+</sup> and He<sup>+</sup> ions, are deformed in a controlled and repetitive manner over blisters formed after subsequent thermal annealing. By using resonant Raman spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the SWCNTs clamped by metallic stripes at their ends are deformed over blisters to an average tensile strain of 0.15 &plusmn; 0.03 %, which is found to be in a good agreement with the value calculated taking into account blister&rsquo;s dimensions. The principle of the technique may be applied to other 1D and 2D materials in perspective.
925	<strong>The formation of relatively low temperature crystalline phase of </strong><strong>Y<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7 </sub>from mesoporous silica and Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:Ln<sup>3+</sup>: Luminescence studies</strong>	Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (mSiO<sub>2</sub>) have been used in many applications including drug delivery, catalysis, sensing. In drug delivery, tracing of mSiO<sub>2 </sub>needs incorporation of organic dyes or radio nuclei, etc.  However, organic dyes are unstable under various mediums or in longer duration. To overcome this, one of ways is use of lanthanide ions (Ln<sup>3+</sup>) such Eu<sup>3+</sup>, Tb<sup>3+</sup> or Dy<sup>3+</sup>, which show luminescence in visible as well as near infrared (NIR) regions. In this work, nanocomposites of mSiO<sub>2</sub> and Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:Ln<sup>3+</sup> have been prepared. These are characterized by many techniques. mSiO<sub>2</sub> is stable up to 500 <sup>o</sup>C and microstructure of mesoporous collapses at 900 <sup>o</sup>C. Interestingly, mSiO<sub>2</sub> reacts with Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to form Y<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7 </sub>phase at 900 <sup>o</sup>C. On the other hand, such phase was not formed from Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and amorphous SiO<sub>2</sub> at same temperature. This finding of the formation of highly crystalline Y<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7 </sub>at lower temperature 900 <sup>o</sup>C is the first report to the best of authors&rsquo; knowledge. Their luminescence studies are performed by single or multi doping of Ln<sup>3+</sup> ions. Their energy transfer processes are discussed. The crystallinity of Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or Y<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is improved after co-doping of Ce<sup>3+</sup> to Ln<sup>3+</sup>. Such nanocomposites are highly dispersible in distilled water, methanol and PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline).
926	<strong>The effect of second phase particles on light transmission of ZnS/diamond nanocomposite</strong>	The effect of second phase size (200, 400, 600 and 800 nm) and volume fraction (10, 20 and 30%) on light scattering behavior of ZnS/diamond composite was simulated using Mie theory and FDTD. To &#x200B;validate&#x200B; this approach&#x200B;, simulation results of Mie theory and FDTD method were compared with experimental light transmission (T) of 50%-50% vol Y2O3-MgO composite. &#x200B;&#x200B;The results showed that the difference between simulation curves based on Mie theory and FDTD method became more significant with increasing second phase size particularly at greater volume fractions. &#x200B;&#x200B;Using the simulated curves of ZnS/diamond nanocomposite using FDTD method, the optimized second phase was found to be &le; 200 nm in volume fractions 10, 20 and 30%&#x200B;. &#x200B;&#x200B;In the other words for ZnS/diamond nanocomposite&#x200B;,&#x200B; &#x200B;with &#x200B;&#x200B;volume fraction of 10, 20 and 30 vol% of diamond,  the effect of diamond &#x200B;particles on  light transmission can be ignored.
927	Dispenser Cathode Modified with Nanocarbon	The technique of manufacturing a metal-porous emitter with two kinds of carbon nanoparticles: the sulfo-adduct of graphene-type particles (Ugleron&#x00AE;) and polyhedral multilayer toroidal particles (Astralen&#x00AE;,) embedded in the active substance and metal sponge is presented. This modification has a goal to improve the emission properties of this type of electron source. The new technology is aimed at increasing the durability of the electri&#x0441; vacuum devices over 100,000 hours. sThe results of emission tests of the modified cathodes are presented. The prototype with Ugleron&#x00AE; particles in the emission substance display service life-time over 30,000 h, and now trials are continuated. The prototype using Astralenes&#x00AE; and Uglerons&#x00AE; in sponge and emission material, respectively with emission current up to 20A/cm2 shows the results comparable with the standard cathode. However, assuming that the cathodes with Astralenes&#x00AE; and Ugleron&#x00AE; have a lower rate of evaporation of the active substance, longer service life-time in comparison with the standard model with the same emission current could be predicted.
928	Structural and optical properties of black TiO2 nanorods	In this communication, XPS, TEM, Raman and UV-visible techniques are used to examine the composition and microstructure of black TiO2 (B-TiO2) nanorods. We find that B-TiO2 presents 89.3% rutile and 10.7% anatase phases, and the rutile TiO2 nanorods with diameter of 5-7 nm plays an important role in enhancing the optical absorption under visible-light region. Besides, we firstly demonstrate that the optical absorption coefficient is closely correlated with the imaginary component of dielectric constant.
929	Angular Dependence of Magnetisation Behaviour in NiFe Nanowires by Micromagnetic Simulations	The Object Oriented Micromagnetic Framework (OOMMF) modelling has been systematically carried out to investigate the magnetization reversal process of ferromagnetic Ni<sub>81</sub>Fe<sub>19</sub> (permalloy) nanowires. These investigations have been executed on two different geometric shapes which were  cylindrical and rectangular nanowires of different diameters/thicknesses (W) up to 150 nm of the same length of 1 &micro;m. For both geometries, there was a slight reduction in the remanent magnetization by increasing the nanowires W up to 100 nm, which then decreased rapidly up to 150 nm. This was attributed to the formation of multidomain structures as confirmed by micromagnetic configurations which indicates that the shape anisotropy is less significant in relatively thick nanowires. There was a reduction in the remanent magnetization by increasing the nanowires angle with respect to the field applied and showed a good agreement with the theoretical calculations. The angular dependence of switching was compared with the literature and with the classical Stoner-Wohlfarth and curling models. Cylindrical nanowires showed slightly higher switching fields than their counterparts rectangular nanowires and was attributed to the discretization effect or the existence of sharp corners in such wires which could prevent the occurrence of the vortex state at their edges. The magnetic reversal response for nanowires of &le;30 nm was well described by the Stoner-Wohlfarth model, whilst, for nanowires of &ge;50 nm was designated by the curling model. The micromagnetic spin structure obtained at different angles of relatively thick nanowires suggested that the reversal is not a simple behavior as predicted by curling model.
930	Neutron Diffraction and Quasielastic Scattering Studies on Layer Nanostructures and Related Dynamics in Imidazolium-based Ionic Liquids	Alkyl-methyl-imidazolium ionic liquids CnmimX (n: alkyl-carbon number, X: anion) have layer nanostructures consisting of ionic and neutral (alkylchain) domains. To investigate the temperature dependences of the inter-layer, inter-ionic group and inter-alkylchain correlations, we have measured the neutron diffraction (ND) of C16mimPF6, C9.5mimPF6 and C8mimPF6 in the temperature region from 4 K to 470 K. The quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) of C16mimPF6 was also measured to study the dynamics of each correlation. C16mimPF6 shows a first-order transition between liquid (L) and liquid crystalline (LC) phases at Tc = 394 K. C8mimPF6 exhibits a glass transition at Tg = 200 K. C9.5mimPF6, which is a 1:3 mixture between C8mimPF6 and C10mimPF6, has both transitions at Tc = 225 K and Tg = 203 K. In the ND experiments, all samples exhibit three peaks corresponding to the correlations mentioned above. The widths of the inter-layer peak at ca. 0.2 &#x00C5;-1 changed drastically at the L-LC transitions, while the inter-ionic peaks at ca. 1 &#x00C5;-1 exhibited a small jump at Tc. The peak position and area of the three peaks did not change much at the transition. On the other hand, the structural changes were minimal at Tg. The QENS experiments demonstrated that the relaxation time of the inter-layer motion increased tenfold at Tc, while those of other motions were monotonous in the whole temperature region. The structural and dynamical changes mentioned above are characteristic of the L-LC transition in imidazolium-based ionic liquids.
931	Thermal conductivity reduction in highly doped mesoporous silicon: the effect of nano-crystal formation	We present a study regarding the thermal transport properties in mesoporous silicon fabricated from highly doped p-type and n-type silicon wafers. We employed a laser induced transient thermal grating technique (TTG) to obtain the effective (in-plane) thermal conductivity (<em>k</em>), which presents a reduction by two orders of magnitude with respect to the bulk value. Furthermore, we show that the main factor for the decrease in <em>k</em> is the reduction in the phonon mean free path (MFP) due to the formation of nano-crystalline domains, which are a consequence of the wet etching fabrication method. Additionally, we present in-plane thermal conductivity calculations employing an effective medium approach, which we modify in order to include MFP reduction due to the presence of both the nanometric pores and the nano-crystalline domains. Our results indicate the importance of considering the phonon MFP reduction of by the nano-crystals when calculating the thermal conductivity of porous samples.
932	A comparative study of individual influences of suspended multiwalled carbon nanotubes and alumina on Rayleigh-Benard convection in water	The generalized Lorenz model for studying the Rayleigh-Benard convection in water-multiwalled carbon nanotubes and water-alumina suspensions in the presence of heat source/sink is derived using a tri-modal, Fourier series representation under the assumption of the Boussinesq approximation and small-scale convective motion. On the premise that the nanoparticles undergo all motions which the liquid particles undergo the single-phase description of the Khanafer-Vafai-Lightstone model can be adopted. The thermophysical properties of water-multiwalled carbon nanotubes and water-alumina are calculated using the phenomenological laws and traditional mixture theory. The transition of the dynamical Lorenz system from stability to chaos is explained in detail by calculating maximum Lyapunov exponent for different values of the eigenvalue (thermal Rayleigh number). Specially, the individual effect of multiwalled carbon nanotubes and alumina on stability of dynamical system is investigated from a new perspective of time series solution and attractors of the generalized Lorenz model. We then study the individual influence of multiwalled carbon nanotubes and alumina on onset of convection and heat transport in terms of such a time series analysis. The findings of a feasibility study indicate that less expensive spherical alumina nanoparticles are preferable in heat transfer applications over the more expensive multiwalled carbon nanotubes, in spite of the latter having larger surface area and higher thermal conductivity. It is found that exactly the same amount of heat transfer obtained by using multiwalled carbon nanotubes can be achieved by replacing them with a slightly higher volume fraction of the much cheaper alumina nanoparticles.
933	Reactive Molecular Dynamic Simulation of Thermal Decomposition for Nano-Aluminized Explosives	Aluminized explosives have important applications in civil constructions and military armaments, but their thermal decomposition mechanisms are not well characterized. Here, the thermal decomposition of TNT, RDX, HMX and CL-20 on Al nanoparticles is examined by reactive dynamic simulations using a newly parameterized reactive force field with low gradient correction (ReaxFF-lg). The partially passivated Al nanoparticles were constructed and mixed with TNT, RDX, HMX and CL-20 crystals and then the mixed systems are heated to high temperature in which the explosives are fully decomposed. The simulation results show that the aluminized explosives undergo three main steps of thermal decomposition, which were denoted as "adsorption period" (0-20 ps), "diffusion period" (20-80 ps) and "formation period" (80-210 ps). These stages in sequence are the chemical adsorption between Al and surrounding explosive molecules (R-NO2-Al bonding), the decomposition of the explosives and the diffusion of O atoms into the Al nanoparticles, and the formation of the final products. In the first stage the Al nanoparticle removes the decomposition reaction barriers of RDX (1.90 kJ/g), HMX (1.95 kJ/g) and CL-20 (1.18 kJ/g), respectively, and decreases the decomposition reaction barrier of TNT from 2.99 to 0.29 kJ/g. Comparing with the crystalline RDX, HMX and CL-20, the energy releases are increased by 4.73-4.96 kJ/g in the second stage. The numbers of produced H2O are increased by 25.27%-27.81% and the numbers of CO2 are decreased by 47.73%-68.01% in the third stage. These three stages are confirmed further by the evolutive diagram of the structure and temperature distribution for the CL-20/Al system. The onset temperatures (To) of generating H2O for all the aluminized explosives decrease, while that of generating CO2 for aluminized HMX and CL-20 increases, which are in accord with the experiment of aluminized RDX.
934	Superconducting coincidence photon detector with short timing jitter	We demonstrate the operation of a new coincidence photon detector with short timing jitter consisting of two superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SSPDs) and a single flux quantum (SFQ) circuit. By utilizing the timing discrimination capability of the SFQ coincidence circuit, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) timing jitter of the entire coincidence photon detector was evaluated as 32.3 ps, which is 36 ps less than that of the standard commercial time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) module, and the timing jitter of SSPD was estimated as ~15 ps. Owing to short timing jitter characteristics, our coincidence photon detector could correctly capture the effect of pulse-width broadening by insertion of an optical bandpass filter. We have also demonstrated that our coincidence photon detection clearly shows Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference with a weak coherent pulse. These results are a crucial step to realizing high timing resolution coincidence measurements, ushering in a new technology to perform timing measurement based multi-photon quantum interference.
935	Entropy generation in Tangent Hyperbolic nanofluid flow due to metachronal wave of cilia	This study presents the advantage of entropy generation in Tangent hyperbolic nanofluid. The blood flow (Tangent hyperbolic nanofluid) is induced by ciliary movement which develop the metachronal wave. The Tangent hyperbolic fluid flows through a symmetric ciliated tube (wavy surface). The momentum and energy equation of the considered fluid flow are modeled with small Reynold's number. The resulting systems of partial differential equations are solved by analytic technique HPM. The mathematical expression of velocity, temperature and entropy generation are calculated analytically and their graphically results for emerging parameters are also presented in last section.
936	<strong>Edge mode based graphene nanomechanical resonators for high-sensitivity mass sensor</strong>	We perform both molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical analysis to study the sensitivity of the mass sensor based on graphene nanomechanical resonators, which are actuated following the global extended mode or the localized edge mode. We find that the mass detection sensitivity corresponding to the edge mode is about three times higher than that corresponding to the extended mode. Our analytic derivations reveal that the enhancement of the sensitivity originates in the reduction of the effective mass for the edge mode due to its localizing feature. Our findings shed light on improving the sensitivity of the graphene based mass spectrometry by utilizing the localized edge mode.
937	Maxwell-Boltzmann versus non-ergodic events in the velocity distribution of water molecules evaporated from protonated water nanodroplets	Measurement of velocity distributions of evaporated water monomers from small mass- and energy-selected protonated water clusters allows probing the extent of thermalization after excitation of these ultimately small nanodroplets. Electronic excitation of a molecule in the cluster is here induced by a single collision with an argon atom in the keV energy range. The measured velocity distributions of the departing neutral molecules exhibit bimodal shapes with a lower-velocity part consistent with a complete redistribution of the deposited energy in the entire cluster and a higher-velocity contribution corresponding to evaporation before complete energy redistribution. Statistical molecular dynamics calculations reproduce the bimodal shape of the velocity distributions by assuming an initial spreading of the excitation energy among all modes, thereby reproducing the lower velocity contribution of the distribution. In contrast, assuming the deposited energy to be initially localized among the modes of a single molecule leads to calculated distributions with two components in accordance with the experimental results. The characteristics and the relative abundance of these two contributions in the velocity distributions obtained are presented and discussed as a function of the number of molecules (n=2-10) in the ionized nanodroplet H+(H2O)n.
938	Reduced Scaling CASPT2 Using Supporting Subspaces and Tensor Hyper-Contraction	We present a reduced scaling formulation of the state specific CASPT2 method requiring O(N4) operations and O(N2) memory for a fixed active space, where N is proportional to system size. Motivated by the properties of the Kronecker sum, we introduce the supporting subspace technique (SST), which decomposes the CASPT2 linear equations into two parts: a single-reference MP2 energy term using dressed orbitals, plus a reduced linear system with dimension scaling as O(N2). Together with Laplace quadrature, the supporting subspace technique allows us to reformulate CASPT2 using a MP2 energy computation and Fock builds. By further applying the tensor hyper-contraction (THC) approximation, the MP2-like term can be computed with O(N4) operations, and the remainder can be solved with O(N3) operations using the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. This is the first application of THC in the context of multi-reference methods. We also developed an efficient implementation of the method by utilizing graphical processing units and exploiting spatial sparsity in tensor operations. We benchmark the accuracy of the new method against conventional CASPT2 for reactions in the gas phase. We apply the new method to Menshutkin SN2 reactions in carbon nanotubes, demonstrating the feasibility of CASPT2 calculations with O(100) atoms.
939	<strong>Functionalizing self-assembled nanostructured a-Si:Al films</strong>	The immiscibility of Si and Al may be utilized to produce a thin film of vertically aligned Al nanowires of 5 nm diameter within an amorphous silicon matrix (a-Si). In this work we study functionalization of these structures by removal of the Al nanowires. The nanowires have been etched by an aqueous solution of HCl, which results in a structure of vertically aligned nanochannels in a-Si with admixture of SiO<sub>x</sub>. The removal of Al nanowires has been monitored by several electron microscopy techniques, X-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and optical reflectance. It has been established that optical reflectance measurements can reliably identify the complete removal of Al, confirmed by other techniques. This provides a robust and relatively simple method for controlling the nano-fabrication process on a macroscopic scale.
940	Silicon slot waveguide Fano resonator	The growing interest for Fano resonators during the past decade is due to the narrow line shape observable in their optical spectrum. The drastic phase shift occurring at the resonance yields a steep drop from a high to a low amplitude. Fano resonances can be obtained by a combination of nanostructures. Such a system is extremely sensitive both in terms of geometrical parameters and environmental conditions. Here, we study a complex arrangement of photonic crystal cavities and slot waveguides on a silicon chip. Our structure, composed of several cavities in parallel, has a particular response superimposing a shallow photonic band gap and a resonance with a Fano line shape. It provides a low noise and a clear asymmetric resonance. We demonstrate it experimentally and show the potential of such a device for sensing. A sensitivity of 92 nm/RIU is measured.
941	In situ thermo-mechanical bending behavior of VO<sub>2</sub> microcantilevers across metal insulator transition	Thermomechanical bending response of VO<sub>2</sub> microcantilever has been investigated at different temperatures across the metal insulator transition using multipoint bending protocol in a nanoindentation system.  Sharp metal-insulator transition and structural change were captured at around 68 &deg;C by resistance-temperature  and differential scanning calorimetry  plots prior to the microcantilever bending experiments respectively. Load-deflection curves were obtained before and after the transition temperature by applying load at a point with systematic variation in distance from fixed end of cantilever. Temperature dependent bending modulus and spring constant of different phases for VO<sub>2</sub> microbeam, anchored at one end have been estimated from the measured cantilever deflection values using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. An abrupt increase in bending modulus varying from 142 GPa  to 170 GPa between 65 &deg;C  and 75 &deg;C is observed. Spring constant of the microcantilever is found to increase by a factor of ~ 1.35 during the structural phase transition of VO<sub>2</sub> from monoclinic to rutile structures. The studied bending behavior of VO<sub>2</sub> across the phase transition with large changes in stiffness values are important for understanding the mechanical response for improving the design towards efficient cantilever and MEMS devices.
942	Tunable and selective transmission based on multiple resonance modes in side-coupled sectorial-ring cavity waveguide	We report a novel plasmonic nanodevice in side-coupled sectorial-ring cavity waveguide, and study the transmission performance of the novel system. It is found from the two-dimensional simulation that the novel system excites the extra non-integer resonance modes, in contrast to the circular-ring cavity resonator system which can support only the classical integer resonance modes. The results show that the multiple resonance modes of the novel system can be highly tuned and modified by manipulating the size of central angle or the position of symmetry plane angle, the central angle has the similar and different influences on resonance wavelengths and minimum transmittances, and the left- or right-handed symmetry plane angle is the same effect. Interestingly, these resonance modes are extremely sensitive to the symmetry plane angle, and the associated modes can be efficiently selected and improved by the enhancing, weakening, exciting or disappearing of resonance mode. The proposed structure not only is oversize central angle, alterable symmetry plane angle and fixed radius and gap, but also forms split-ring-like, realizes asymmetrical cavity and achieves tunable and selective transmission. Our results indicate that the plasmonic nanodevice is a promising candidate as a tunable and selective multi-channel nanofilter or nanosensor in plasmonic nanophotonics applications, and the optical technique provides a good flexibility to accurately design the transmission spectrum with prospective modes in integrated nano-optics devices.
943	<SPAN style="font-size: 20.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; color: windowtext;">Rapid Dip-Dry MWNT-rGO Ink Wrapped Polyester Elastic Band (PEB) For Piezoresistive Strain Sensor Applications</SPAN>	Herein, we report the fabrication as well as application of the multiwall carbon nanotubes- reduced graphene oxide polyester band (MWNT-rGO@PEB) piezoresistive strain sensor for the human-machine interfacing applications. The addition of unzipped functionalized MWNTs in the rGO ink assists in providing the propagation path to the charge carriers. The sensing mechanism involved for this strain sensor comprises of two regimes, one with GF 150 (0 % to 25 %) and other one is 650 (28 % to 40 %) with the change in the resistivity at low strain value since the fibres entangled together and wrapped with conductive rGO flakes gets separated very slightly apart while at higher stain values, the flakes wrapped on the fibres backbones are separated far apart such that percolation path for the charges got disconnected. This kind of sensing mechanism is potential enough to detect small scale as well as large scale motions with excellent reproducibility over 2000 cycles. Some heath monitoring applications such as forearm motion, cheek bulging, finger bending, etc have been successfully demonstrated in the real time by using this piezoresistive strain sensor. The significant advantages of these sensors are that its cost is low; it is easy to fabricate (one step); and it has a versatility that renders it favourable to health-monitoring applications.
944	MHD flow of Carreau nanofluid over a stretching surface with suction/injection and slip effects by using Haar wavelet quasilinearization method	The purpose of this paper is to present the Carreau nanofluid model for the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow induced by stretching surface with velocity slip boundary where the presence of suction and injection parameters are taken into account. The governing system of equations is reduced to the ordinary differential equations with boundary conditions by similarity transformation. These equations are numerically solved by using Haar wavelet quasilinearization method (HWQM). The behavior of various pertinent parameters such as local Weissenberg number, Hartman number, velocity slip parameter, suction/injection parameter, Biot number, thermophoresis parameter, Brownian motion parameter, Prandtl number, thermal radiation parameter, Eckert number and Schmidt number on velocity, temperature, concentration, surface drag force and heat transfer rate are computed and analyzed through graphs and tables. Comparison with published results in the literature is made under some special and limited cases and an excellent agreement is found.
945	Engineering Half-Metallicity and Magnetic Phase Transition for Phagraphene Nanoribbons by Functional Groups and Electric Field	Magnetic nanomaterials with the desirable nature are the basis for developing future spintronic devices, and research for them is of fundamental interest. Here, we explore the realization of half-metallicity and magnetic phase transition for phagraphene nanoribbons in virtue of functional groups (OH and CN) with different coverage fraction and external electric field. The first-principles calculations show that a single-edge CN functionalization only makes a intrinsic spin-degenerate semiconducting ribbon converted to a quasi-metal or metal, while a single-edge OH modification leads to an occurrence of the half-semiconducting nature regardless of the coverage fraction of groups. Interestingly, the half-metal behavior for the CN and OH double-edge modified ribbons can be achieved either in the zero-electric-field intrinsic state for most of functionalized systems or at a very low electric field, 0.1 V/&#x00C5;. More importantly, the observed critical electric field for the transition from ferromagnetic to nonmagnetic phase is lowered significantly almost for all systems, this benefits to design a low electric-field-controlling magnetic switch which can reversibly work between both magnetic and nonmagnetic states. The calculated Gibbs free energy confirms that the group-modified ribbons generally hold a more favorable energy stability in most of the cases, facilitating likely experimental realization.
946	<strong>The Piezotronic Effect in ZnO/ZnS Core-Shell Nanowires and Used as a Flexible Force Sensor</strong>	Investigating the piezotronic effect in the core-shell structure based on ZnO piezoelectric semiconductor is important for developing a complete piezotronic theory and designing novel multifunctional devices. Uniformly and vertically ZnO/ZnS core shell nanowires arrays were successfully prepared through a low temperature solution method. The piezotronic effect in individual core-shell structure ZnO/ZnS nanowire was systematically investigated by using conductive atomic force microscopy. The results showed that the energy band structures and electronic transport properties can be effectively modulated by the external force and it can be treated as piezotronic transistor. We further demonstrated a robust flexible force sensor based on ZnO/ZnS nanoarrays and could detect different forces with the change of output voltages. These results demonstrated here broaden the scope of piezotronics and extend its potential applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and human-machine interfacing.
947	Effect of Zn interstitials on the violet emission from &lt;101&gt; directed ZnO nanostructure	Oxidation of metallic Zn powder on Si substrates at 600 &deg;C produces ZnO nanostucrure which possess a predominant &lt;101&gt; orientation in wurtzite structure as found in the XRD pattern. Room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra exhibited a reduced typical exciton emission or near-band-edge emission in the UV region at 370 nm, whereas a strong violet emission at ~430 nm was surveyed in the visible region. The creation of the interstitials Zn sites within ZnO network creates the &lt;101&gt; preferred crystallographic orientation where the violet  emission arises due to the probable transition of electrons entrapped at Zn interstitial (Zn<sub>i</sub>) defects to the valence band of ZnO. Due to the quantum mechanical hybridization between the electronic orbital&rsquo;s of the relevant donor and acceptor states, the O vacancy and Zn<sub>i</sub> interstitial have the analogous formation energies that happens through Columbian interaction. The high-concentration Zn interstitial defect which constructs the &lt;101&gt; crystallographic orientation and the consequential strong violet PL emission are projected to advance clarification of the mechanisms of defect related emission and expand the opto-electronic applications of ZnO matrix.
948	<strong>High Performance Self-Gating Graphene/MoS<sub>2 </sub>Diode Enabled by Asymmetric Contacts</strong>	Graphene-MoS<sub>2</sub> (GM) heterostructure based diode is fabricated using asymmetric contacts to MoS<sub>2</sub> as well as an asymmetric top gate (ATG). The GM diode exhibits a rectification-ratio of 5 from asymmetric contacts which is improved to 10<sup>5</sup> after the incorporation of ATG. This improvement is attributed to the asymmetric modulation of carrier concentration and effective Schottky barrier height by the ATG during forward and reverse bias. This is further confirmed from the temperature dependent measurement, where a difference of 0.22 eV is observed between the effective Schottky barrier height for forward and reverse bias. Moreover, the rectification ratio also depends on carrier concentration in MoS<sub>2</sub> and can be varied with the change in temperature as well as back gate voltage. Under laser light illumination, the device demonstrates strong opto-electric response with 100 times improvement in the relative photocurrent as well as responsivity of <em>1.9 A/W</em> and a specific detectivity of <em>2.4 &times; 10<sup>10</sup> Jones</em>. These devices can also be implemented using other two dimensional materials and suggest a promising approach to incorporate diverse 2D materials for future nano-electronics and optoelectronics applications.
949	Dissolutive flow in nanochannels: transition between plug-like and Poiseuille-like	Dynamic properties of dissolutive flow in nanochannels were investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. It turned out that the liquid flow pattern changes greatly after the dissolution effect taken into consideration. Liquid inside the channel has a plug-like velocity profile when the dissolubility is low, whereas a Poiseuille-like flow was observed as the dissolubility increases. By introducing the dissolution term to molecular kinetic theory, we explained the physical mechanisms of velocity transition. During which a modified dimensionless Galilei number was proposed to describe the effect of main forces qualitatively. The results showed that in pressure-driven flow, when the dissolubility is low, the dominant dissipation is the viscous dissipation and the theoretical model of insolubility is acceptable. However, as the dissolubility increases, the dissolving dissipation takes priority, which results in the velocity profiles becoming Poiseuille-like. In addition, we analyzed the evolution of fluid density, number of dissolved solid particles and concentration distribution of solute. Specifically, the liquid density varying from layered oscillation to uniform distribution was obtained, which can be described by a critical number. The analysis of solute concentration helps to establish the scaling relationship among the dissolution rate, convection velocity, and diffusion coefficient. These findings not only help to understand the physical mechanisms of dissolutive flow but also help to control and optimize the flow patterns in dissoluble channels.
950	<strong>Impedance spectroscopy of gold conjugated PCR products on robust PCB micro-chips</strong>	Molecular diagnostics have always been in the forefront for disease identification and control. Various approaches for carrying out molecular diagnostics through identification of genes or proteins exist and are largely deployed in the laboratories for testing although there exist a wide possibility of refinement in these existing processes. In this respect, impedance based methods of detection comprise of one of the most deployable methods primarily due to their easy integrability with micro-electronic systems. Impedance assisted detection strategies are very robust and easy. Impedance assisted technique is very commonly used for detection of DNA and DNA amplification through the Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) although it does not really make a very specific identification system parallel to some other optical techniques; like TAQMAN PCR or Molecular beacon assisted detection of DNA sequences.  In the current article, we have developed a strategy through nanoparticle labeling which enhances the specificity of identification of tagged- amplified DNA samples coming out of a PCR process. Impedance characteristics with respect to various number of PCR cycles with a product consisting of nanoparticle labeled DNA samples are measured with respect to increasing concentration. A significant differentiation is observed between the unlabeled DNA non-specifically amplified and the labeled specifically amplified sequence through varied impedance signals. The eventual goal here is to integrate this strategy with micro-chip PCR to evolve a paradigm shift in the PCR micro-chip technology.
951	Calorimetric investigations in a particle clusteraggregation source	A gas aggregation source based on DC magnetron sputtering was investigated using a passive thermal probe and supplementary diagnostics (Langmuir probe and quartz crystal microbalance). Parameter variations of pressure, axial distance and magnetron current have been performed for three different targets (pure Cu, pure W, composite Cu/W) in argon discharge. The measurements showed the energy flux to be significantly higher for the case of the pure tungsten and the composite target compared to the copper target, which is likely a result of the strongly increased amount of neutrals being reflected from the heavier targets. Furthermore, gas rarefaction by the sputtered atoms was found to be essential for the understanding of the observed energy flux and that the dominant contributors to the energy flux in the higher pressure regime are comparable to those observed in the conventional lower pressure regime. Selected deposited films have been investigated ex-situ by scanning electron microscopy, which allowed to gain insight into the nanoparticle formation in relation to the observed energy conversion.
952	<strong>Enhanced optical and X-ray photon response in solution-synthesized CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles wrapped by reduced graphene oxide</strong>	CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles uniformly distributed on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to form CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>/rGO nanocomposites are synthesized by a facile method. Their corresponding optical and X-ray photon responses are investigated. UV-visible absorption spectra and photoluminescence measurements confirm that loading CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles with an even distribution onto rGO surface can enhance the absorption and photon-generated carrier transportation. Thus, a significant enhancement in optical and X-ray photon response is demonstrated in CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>/rGO nanocomposites as compared with pure CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles. Clear conductive switching phenomenon with a state conversion between &ldquo;on&rdquo; and &ldquo;off&rdquo; is also observed under the intermittent light exposure. These results may provide a new potential application of CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>/rGO nanocomposites for optical and X-ray photon detection.
953	Thermal sensing in fluid at the micro-nano-scales	Temperature is one of the most fundamental parameters for the characterization of a physical system. With the rapid development of lab-on-a-chip and biology at the single cell level, a great demand has risen for the temperature sensors, which can be used in liquid environments with high spatial, temporal and thermal resolution. Nevertheless, measuring temperature in liquid environment is always a technical challenge. Various factors may affect the sensing results, such as the fabrication parameters of the built-in sensors, thermal property of the electrical insulating layer and stability of fluorescent thermometers in liquid environment, etc. In this review, we focused on different kinds of micro/nano-thermometers applied in the thermal sensing for microfluidic systems and cultured cells. We discussed the advantages and limitations of these thermometers in specific applications, and challenges and possible solutions for more accurate temperature measurements in further studies.
954	Separation of Polymer Mixtures by Length Using a Series of Nanopores Connected by Nanochannels	Multiscale coarse-grained simulations were used to explore the dynamics of semi-flexible polymers driven through a series of nanopores connected by nanochannels as a method of separating polymers by length. A multi-scale approach was employed in which each polymer was modelled as a chain of beads near the nanopores and as a single particle in the bulk of the nanochannels. By observing that polymers rarely escape back into the bulk of the nanochannels after coming sufficiently close to the nanopores, simulations at these two length scales were decoupled. The dynamics across many independent nanopore-nanochannel devices in series were then deduced mathematically from simulations across a single device. As expected, the time to translocate across a single nanopore increased with chain length. Conversely, however, the time to cross the nanochannels from one nanopore to the next decreased with chain length. Whereas longer chains drifted directly from nanopore to nanopore, smaller chains explored more of the nanochannel volume between translocations. The time between translocations could thus be adjusted by changing the size and shape of the nanochannels. In this way, different geometries are able to sort polymers by increasing length, decreasing length, or non-monotonically by length such that polymers of an intermediate size emerge first.
955	Fast spontaneous emission and high F&ouml;rster resonance energy transfer rate in hybrid organic/inorganic plasmonic nanostructures	We report an experimental study of the plasmon-assisted spontaneous emission and the F&ouml;rster resonance energy transfer between organic molecules and semiconductor colloidal quantum dots. The localized plasmonic field in the nanogap between a gold nano-popcorn&rsquo;s tips and a 5-nm separated gold film supports high photonic density of states and provides pathways for the light-matter interaction mechanisms. We demonstrate that, besides the spontaneous emission enhancement with Purcell factor up to 66 for molecules and quantum dots, the F&ouml;rster resonance energy transfer efficiency and rate constant are simultaneously modified.  While the energy transfer efficiency is reduced from 82% to 35% due to the non-radiative quenching effect and fast donor spontaneous emission rate, the energy transfer rate constant is significantly increased from 3 to 32 ns<sup>-1</sup>. Our results have quantitatively elucidated decay mechanisms that are important toward understanding and controlling of the light-matter interaction at the nanoscale.
956	Cell with flat liquid interfaces for small angle x-ray scattering of nanoparticle self-assembly	The use of cells with walls at angles matching the contact angle of the liquid substrate or layer can significantly reduce the size of the meniscus, improving the probing of a liquid surface or interface by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). For ordered arrays of nanoparticles at a liquid/gas interface, this enables extremely high degrees of order to be visible in the SAXS images.
957	Fractal dimension effect on the magnetization curve of exchange-coupled cluster of magnetic nanoparticles	The effect of the fractal dimension of exchange-coupled clusters of magnetic nanoparticles on their magnetization curves has been predicted earlier on the base of random anisotropy model. This provides the basis for an indirect measurement technique of the fractal dimension in nanoparticle cluster from the magnetization curve analyses. The reliability of this technique is verified by means of micromagnetic modeling. It is shown that the effective fractal dimension of the magnetic correlation volume, estimated from the approach to magnetic saturation analysis, agrees with the fractal dimension of the cluster calculated directly by box counting method. The fractal dimension, estimated from the grain-size dependence of the coercive force, strongly divergent with values estimated from an analysis of the cluster morphology by box counting as a result of dipole-dipole interaction between the nanoparticles.
958	Nanoscale Fingerprinting with Hyperbolic Metamaterials	We develop a new concept for optical sub-wavelength discrimination of nanostructures positioned on a hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) surface using only far-field measurements of the spectral scattered intensity. The device demonstrating our approach consists of a HMM structure, one strong scatterer on top of the HMM at an a priori known location, and the target nanostructures to be sensed on the opposite interface of the HMM. Under far-field illumination from the top, highly localized beams are generated within the HMM by the top scatterer, with wavelength-dependent propagation directions. If the incident wavelength is varied, the localized beam will sweep across the target(s) and the far-field scattered intensity versus wavelength from the bottom target(s) can be measured. We show that this far-field measurement can be used to determine the location of the target(s) with deep-subwavelength accuracy. In addition, discrimination of targets made from different materials can be achieved.
959	A Physical SBT-Memristor-Based Chua's Circuit and Its Complex Dynamics	SBT memristor is a physical memristor built on Sr0.95Ba0.05TiO3 nanometer film, described by a deterministic flux-controlled mathematical model. A new physical SBT-memristor-based Chua's circuit is presented in this paper, using the memristor to replace the Chua diode to connect with a negative conductance in parallel. The circuit can be well modeled by a fourth-order nonlinear system in the voltage-current domain and a third-order nonlinear system in the flux-charge domain, respectively. The dependence of the circuit stability on both the initial state value of the SBT memristor and the linear resistance in the circuit is analyzed theoretically, verified by numerical simulations, which shows that the circuit system has complex dynamics with multiple behaviors, including sink, periodic cycle, limit cycle, chaos, and some complicated transient dynamical behaviors. The new findings shed lights to future research on the physical realization of the SBT-memristor-based Chua's circuit and other similar devices.
960	<strong>Flexible Fiber-Shaped Liquid/Quasi-Solid-State Quantum Dot-Sensitized Solar Cells Based on Different Metal Sulfide Counter Electrodes</strong>	Flexible fiber-shaped quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) were fabricated by assembling the CdS/CdSe quantum dot (QD) deposited TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotube photoanodes and different metal sulfide (i.e., NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>, Ni<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8 </sub>and Co<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub>) counter electrodes (CEs) all grown on Ti wires with a liquid or gel polysulfide electrolyte. Using the NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> CEs, the best power conversion efficiencies of 3.41% and 2.76% were obtained for the resultant fiber-shaped QDSSCs with the liquid and gel polysulfide electrolytes, respectively. Impressively, all the metal sulfide electrodes showed considerable stability under electrochemical cycling tests.
961	<strong>Electromagnetic and thermomechanical analysis of near-field heat transfer in heat-assisted magnetic recording heads </strong>	Heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) is a relatively new data storage technology that promises to satisfy the increasing demands for higher storage densities. During the operation of a HAMR hard-disk drive, heat transfer across the few nanometers head-disk gap does not follow classical heat transfer principles. The HAMR technology relies on laser heating of a sub-diffraction-limit region of the magnetic medium to lower its coercivity and allow the magnetic head to write data in the form of tightly packed bits. The thermal protrusion produced as a result of laser heating is strongly affected by near-field heat transfer. A typical HAMR head model with all key components was used in a coupled electromagnetic-thermomechanical analysis to investigate the effect of near-field heat transfer on the thermal characteristics of the magnetic head. The effects of various heat sources and read/write conditions on the development of thermal protrusion and surface temperature distribution at the trailing edge of the slider body are examined in the context of simulation results.
962	Electronic transport decay factor in a junction of oligophenylene-linked molecule between graphene nanoribbon electrodes	It is generally believed that the nonresonant tunneling decayingsthrough a molecular junction is exponentially dependent on thesproperties of molecule and its contact to electrodes. Here we studysthe dependence of electrode-materials on the transport for asmolecular junction with different graphene nanoribbon (GNR)selectrodes, in which the molecule consisting one, two, and threesphenyls are considered, respectively. By the \emph{ab initio}scalculations, we demonstrate that the current via a zigzag-edge GNRs(ZGNR) electrode junction reaches to the magnitude of $\mu$A with asconvex-arc-shaped dependence under low bias, which is different fromsthat via a similar Au-electrode junction ($\sim$nA) with a linearsrelationship over the same bias scope. Interestingly, the currentsdrops to $\sim$pA with a nonlinear dependence when the electrodessare replaced by the same width conducting armchair-edge GNR (AGNR)sin connection with molecule at the insulating carbon-dimer chains,sbut when the connection is moved to a conducting chain of AGNR thescurrent increases up to $\sim$nA. Further, the current through asjunction with chiral GNR-electrodes (more general case) is ofsdifferent orders of magnitude (few to hundreds of nA), but show thessimilar \emph{I-V} characteristics to that for AGNR-electrode one.sNonetheless, for all types of GNR-electrode junctions thesrelationship between the resistance and the molecular length issalways a straight line in the semilog coordinate but with differentsslopes, implying different decay factors. Therefore, although thestransport exponential law itself is electrode-independent,simportantly, the decay factor is sensitively dependent not only onsthe nature of electrode materials but also on the morphology ofselectrode-molecule coupling. Our results here have demonstrated asuniversal feature in electronic transport for molecular junctions.
963	<strong>Self-assembly of Nickel: From Nanoparticles to Foils with</strong> <strong>Tunable Magnetic Properties</strong>	<strong>In this letter, self-assembly of nickel from nanoparticles to nanowires and foils can be achieved through controlling the concentrations of sodium citrate(Na3Cit) during electroless deposition process. As the concentrations of Na3Cit increased, the morphology of nickel gradually evolved from nanoparticles into nanochains, nanowires, nanowire nonwoven fabrics and foils, respectively. The coercivity of metal nickel was as follows: nanoparticles (75 Oe), nanochains (100 Oe), nanowires (290 Oe), nanowire nonwoven fabrics (280 Oe) and macroscopic foils (130 Oe). This feasible approach shows an effective strategy to fabricate magnetic materials assembly.</strong>
964	<strong>Resonance-Antiresonance behavior in a disorder dielectric composite of BiNiFe<sup>3+</sup> in Microwave Frequency</strong>	In this paper we are studying synthesized and electromagnetic parameters of BiNiFe<sup>3+</sup> nanomaterial. The complex part of the permeability, impedance and refractive index are found to be negative in the entire frequency of X- band. We observed resonance-antiresonance in the nanomaterials, resonance in the permittivity and antiresonance in the permeability. The resonance-antiresonance may be due to the Mie resonance associated by the negative &mu;&Prime;. The nanocomposite material of thickness 3mm has the maximum microwave absorption of -21dB (95%) at 9.50GHz. The nanocomposite material has the intrinsic metamaterial characteristics.
965	<strong>Fiber biosensor exploiting microfiber light polarization modulation induced by magnetic nanoparticles self-assembly</strong>	An optical fiber biosensor is demonstrated exploiting the detection of microfiber light polarization modulation. Microfiber is directly immersed in the magnetic fluid (MF) which contains carboxylated magnetic nanoparticles (CMNPs), without needing the modification of the microfiber surface. While, only an external magnetic field is utilized. Self-assembly of CMNPs is induced after adding bovine serum albumin (BSA) into the MF. The microfiber light polarization modulation relaxation time is prolonged, when external magnetic field is applied or removed for a given period of time. The concentration of BSA solution can be detected by detecting the maximum light polarization degree, or detecting the difference between the maximum and minimum polarization degree. In our experiments, compared with the pure MF, BSA solution which has a concentration as low as 0.05&mu;g/mL induces obvious light polarization modulation. The signal processing system of the biosensor is not only simple but also cost effective. Moreover, biomasses, such as virus, biotin, DNA, and phosphate compounds can also be detected using our scheme.
966	Negative Poisson's ratio in monolayer blue phosphorene nanoribbon with edge sulfur passivation	Motivated by the recent successful growth of monolayer blue<br />phosphorus (BlueP), here we study the mechanical property in<br />connection with microstructure for zigzag BlueP nanoribbons<br />(zBluePNRs) with different edge chemical modification. Based on the<br />first-principles calculations, strikingly, we find that a narrow<br />zBluePNR ($\sim$2 nm) with edge sulfur (S) passivation under an<br />uniaxial tensile strain exhibit an important effect of negative<br />Poisson's ratio because of the particularity of the P-S bonds at<br />edges, and as the ribbon width increases the Poisson's ratio varies<br />from negative to positive. Meanwhile, the S-passivation also induces<br />magnetism, and applying a strong enough strain can transfer a<br />zBluePNR from magnetic metal state to half-metal one.
967	<strong>Enhancement in photocatalytic antibacterial activity of ICP assisted plasma sputtered N-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films</strong>	Specific plasma engineering based synthesis can induce interesting photocatalytic antibacterial activities in TiO<sub>2</sub> films. This work studied the conjugation of pulsed DC plasma with inductively coupled plasma (ICP) to synthesize undoped and N-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films by plasma sputtering. The surface properties of resulting films were systematically analysed in details and correlated to the photocatalytic antibacterial activity against Gram negative <em>Escherichia coli</em>. The addition of ICP source to pulsed-DC discharge generated TiO<sub>2</sub> films with enriched surface roughness due to the bombardment of highly activated species on the substrate. The ICP assisted films exhibited the morphology of nanoclusters with clear defined boundaries, higher O content and higher surface wettability. It was found that N-doping and addition of ICP source significantly increase the eradication of bacteria both in dark as well as in white light (artificial indoor light). Higher antibacterial activity of N-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> films in white light has been explained by photocatalytic degradation mechanism.
968	Abnormal Liquid-Liquid Phase Transition in Nanoconfined Silicon-oxygen Mixture Liquids	We confirm the existence of liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT) in quasi-2D silicon-oxygen mixture liquid with different ratio of oxygen to silicon (0.55, 1.0, 2.0, respectively) under nanoslit confinement by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Layering transitions induced by increasing silt size (SS) and pressure are the typical characteristics of the LLPT. The appearance of the small shoulder peak between the first and second peak in pair correlation function as SS decreases and pressure increases further indicate the LLPT. In addition, the density (&#x03C1;), pressure perpendicular to walls (P&#x22A5;), average potential energy (Ep) and diffusion coefficient (D) show abrupt change during the LLPT. LLPTs usually occur in all liquids which are similar in layering transition but not appear synchronously in different liquids.
969	<em>Coherently strained epitaxial YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sub>-d</sub> films grown on NdGaO<sub>3</sub> (110) </em>	YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sub>-d</sub> is a good candidate to systematically study high-temperature superconductivity by nanoengineering using advanced epitaxy. An essential prerequisite for these studies are coherently strained YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sub>-d</sub> thin films, which we present here using NdGaO<sub>3</sub> (110) as a substrate. The films are coherent up to at least 100 nm thickness and have a critical temperature of 89 +- 1 K. The a and b lattice parameters of the YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sub>-d</sub> are matched to the in-plane lattice parameters of NdGaO<sub>3</sub> (110), resulting in a large reduction of the orthorhombicity of the YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sub>-d</sub>. These results imply that a large amount of structural disorder in the chain layers of YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sub>-d</sub> is not detrimental to superconductivity.
970	Impact of photothermal on light-induced ultrafast insulator-to-metal transition in VO2 nanofilms	Ultrafast detection and switching of light are key processes in high-speed optoelectronic devices. However, the performances of VO<sub>2</sub>-based optoelectronics are strongly degraded by photothermal. The mechanism of the latter is still unclear. Here, by using femtosecond-laser (<em>fs</em>-laser) driven kinetic terahertz wave absorption, we quantitatively separate slow photothermal response and ultrafast photodoping response (e.g. light-induced insulator-to-metal transition) from second- to picosecond-timescales, and discover the competing interplay between them. With photothermal, the ultrafast transition time was degraded by 190% from 50 <em>ps</em> to 95 <em>ps</em>, the ultrafast transition threshold was decreased to 82% from 11mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> to 9mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, while the amplitudes of the two photoresponse are competing. Percolation theory, along with the macroscopic conductivity response, is used to explain the competing interplay. Our findings are relevant for designing and optimizing VO<sub>2</sub>-based ultrafast optoelectronic devices.
971	Solvent-mediated interactions between nanostructures: from water to Lennard-Jones liquid	Solvent-mediated interactions emerge from complex mechanisms that depend on the solute structure, its wetting properties and the nature of the liquid. While numerous studies have focused on the two first influences, here, we compare results from water and Lennard-Jones liquid in order to reveal to what extend solvent-mediated interactions are universal with respect to the nature of the liquid. Beside the influence of the liquid, results were obtained with classical density functional theory and brute-force molecular dynamics simulations which allows us to build connections between these two numerical techniques.
972	<strong>The effects of nonlocal parameter, aspect ratio, boundary conditions and medium modolus on the buckling behavior of nanocompsite plate by using of</strong> <strong>DQM</strong>	In this paper, the mechanical buckling of a multi-layered nanocomposite rectangular plate reinforced by single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) on Pasternak elastic medium subjected to in-plane loadings is investigated. The equilibrium and stability equations are derived using the higher-order shear deformation plate theory (HSDT) considering the nonlocal theory of Eringen and variational approach. Uniformly distributed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) plate is considered. Differential quadrature method (DQM) has been used to solve the governing equations for various boundary conditions. Next, the effects of nonlocal parameter, aspect ratio, boundary conditions and medium modolus on the buckling behavior of nanocompsite plate are studied. Finally, the results of simpler examples studied are verified by other references.
973	Bioinspired, Nanoscale Approaches in Contemporary Bioanalytics	The genesis for this review stems from the interdisciplinary Biointerfaces International conference 2016 (BI 2016) in Zurich, Switzerland wherein the need for advances in analytical tools was both expressed and addressed by recent and exciting developments in the field of bioanalytics. Pushing the limits of detection for characterizing individual components, such as single proteins, single drug-delivery vehicles, or probing single living cells in a more natural environment, will contribute to our understanding of the complex biomolecular systems central to a number of applications including medical diagnostics, tissue engineering as well as in drug screening and delivery. Starting with the field of single nanoparticle analytics, a review is presented with an emphasis on two emerging techniques. The first technique is based on single-particle tracking of nanoparticles tethered to mobile supported lipid bilayer, enabling the simultaneous characterization of both size and composition of individual nanoparticles. The second technique is based on probing variations in the ionic conduction across nanoscale apertures for detection of, not only nanoparticles but also, membrane-tethered proteins, thereby allowing a multiparameter characterization of individual nanoscopic objects, addressing their size, shape, charge and dipole moment. Thereafter, the complementarity and usefulness of such approaches are addressed by way of an application critically dependent on advanced bioanalytics, namely the development of biomimetic lipid- and polymer-based assemblies as stimuli responsive artificial organelles and nanocarriers designed to optimize delivery of next generation high-molecular-weight biological drugs. Finally, a technique based on probing and manipulating the content of an individual living cell via fluidic force microscopy will be summarized in the context of single-cell analysis while considering the potential use of this and related methods to explore the fate of cells treated with, for example, biomimetic drug-containing nanoparticles. By highlighting a concerted movement in the field of bioinspired, nanoscale surface approaches in bioanalytics, positioned in the context of drug delivery, and by concluding with an outlook projecting future directions in this area, it is our aim to evaluate progress in the field of single component bioanalytics and to emphasize the impact of initiating and maintaining a fruitful dialogue among scientists, together with clinicians and industry, to steer innovation to successful translation.
974	<strong>Electromagnetic and thermomechanical analysis of near-field heat transfer in heat-assisted magnetic recording heads </strong>	Heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) is a relatively new data storage technology that promises to satisfy the increasing demands for higher storage densities. During the operation of a HAMR hard-disk drive, heat transfer across the few nanometers head-disk gap does not follow classical heat transfer principles. The HAMR technology relies on laser heating of a sub-diffraction-limit region of the magnetic medium to lower its coercivity and allow the magnetic head to write data in the form of tightly packed bits. The thermal protrusion produced as a result of laser heating is strongly affected by near-field heat transfer. A typical HAMR head model with all key components was used in a coupled electromagnetic-thermomechanical analysis to investigate the effect of near-field heat transfer on the thermal characteristics of the magnetic head. The effects of various heat sources and read/write conditions on the development of thermal protrusion and surface temperature distribution at the trailing edge of the slider body are examined in the context of simulation results.
975	Influence of degree of complex network on heat conduction	Devices made of nanotubes and nanowires networks are of great interests for applications and have caught<br />an increasing attention in recent years. In this work, we study the heat conduction in a network model with<br />nodes being atoms and links being 1D chains of atoms. It is found that heat conduction in the complex network<br />is fundamentally different from that of regular lattices. It depends very sensitively on the average degrees of<br />complex networks and the degree of nodes that attached to the two heat baths. For example, when the two heat<br />source nodes have the same degree ki, the heat flux decreases with the increase of ki. In other words, the sparse<br />network is more favorable to heat flux. Thermal rectification effect is found when the two heat source nodes<br />have different degrees. Theoretical analysis is provided to explain the numerical results.
976	Pore diameter dependence of catalytic activity: p-nitrobenzaldehyde conversion to an aldol product in amine-functionalized mesoporous silica	Reaction yield for conversion of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (PNB) to an aldol product in amine-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) exhibits a 20-fold enhancement for a modest increase in pore diameter, d. This enhanced catalytic activity is shown to reflect a strong increase in the "passing propensity", P, of reactant and product species inside the pores. We find that P &#xF0BB; 0, corresponding to single-file diffusion, applies for the smallest d. In this regime of narrow pores, d still significantly exceeds the linear dimensions of PNB and the aldol product, but these elongated species must align with each other and with the pore axis in order to pass. Thus, P reflects both translational and rotational diffusion. Langevin simulation accounting for these features is used to determine P versus d. The results are also augmented by analytic theory for small and large d where simulation is inefficient. Connection with catalytic activity and yield is achieved by incorporation of results for P into a multi-scale modeling framework. Specifically, we apply a spatially coarse-grained (CG) stochastic model for the overall catalytic reaction-diffusion process in MSN. Pores are treated as linear arrays of cells from the ends of which species adsorb and desorb, and between which species hop and exchange, with the exchange rate reflecting P. CG model predictions including yield are assessed by Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation.
977	Nanoscale Cavitation in perforation of cellular membrane by shock-wave induced nanobubble collapse	The collapse of the bubble induced by the shock wave leads to nano-jet, which is able to perforating cellular membrane. This phenomenon is investigated by Martini coarse-grained molecular dynamic (CG-MD) simulations in the present study. It is found that the occurrence of cavitation nucleation at the nanoscale can be observed during the perforating process. The cavitation locates near the puncture of the cell membrane and its ultimate evolutionary form presents a ring-like structure. The volume of the cavitation is calculated for different initial bubble size, and it is found that the maximum volume of the cavitation area has a correlation with the initial bubble size. To understand the underlying physics of the cavitation phenomenon, the classical nucleation theory based on the Rayleigh-Plesset equation is applied to the non-equilibrium nanoscale system after the pressure field is obtained by using Irving-Kirkwood-Noll procedure. The consistence between the results of CG-MD and the theory reveals that the average pressure of the local environment plays a crucial role in cavitation occurrence on the non-equilibrium system subjected to strong inertia, e.g., shock wave and nano-jet.
978	Nitrogen plasma-induced HfSiON film growth from Hf nanoscale islands on SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si	HfSiON films for high-k dielectric applications is synthesized from Hf nanoscale islands on SiO2/Si(100) substrates using nitrogen inductive coupled plasma (ICP) exposure. The process consists of the novel interfacial reaction of nanoscale islands with the substrate induced by plasma-derived radicals and ions. The Hf metal islands nucleate on SiO2/Si(100) surface by strain-induced engineering during electron beam evaporation. In-vacuo AFM measurement shows the N2 ICP exposure collapses the islands to form films. XPS analysis shows the ICP exposure initially nitrides Hf islands in 1 minute; then it induces interfacial reaction of the base SiO2 layer and HfN in the following stage. The rapid nitridation of Hf is the unique feature of the process initiated from nanoscale islands. The chemical composition ratio of Hf: Si: N in the film can be roughly controlled to be 1: 1: 1 with the ICP exposure time of 20 minutes. The uniformity of the grown films depends on the initial uniformity of the islands and the surface diffusion of materials. The study is a unique example of the film growth method based on the nanoscale interaction of the surface nucleated islands and the substrate material induced by plasmas.
979	Silver nanowire plasmon-assisted and ultraviolet light induced graphene oxide coatings reduction for highly transparent electrodes	In this paper, we prepared a transparent conducting composite electrode composed of silver nanowires (Ag NWs) and reduced graphene oxide (r-GO). Here we present a simple approach to obtain the good weldings at cross-positions of Ag NWs by employing weights at a relatively low temperature (100 {degree sign}C). The Ag NWs/r-GO composite films have been explored not only for the protective effect, but also Ag NWs can be used as plasmonic NWs assisted ultraviolet (UV) light to reduce the GO, and the coatings of r-GO to form Ag NWs/r-GO composite structure can enhance the conductivity of the film by providing more efficient electron conductive pathways. The G/D intensity ratios of GO and r-GO produced by a UV light-induced method without or with Ag NWs were 0.95, 1.01, 1.04, respectively. The lowest sheet resistance of the composite films was 7 ohm/sq with about 82% transparency in the visible spectrum region, and no degradation was observed after two months. The excellent environmental stability might facilitate applications of Ag NWs/r-GO composite films in optoelectronic devices.

The potential calculated in the framework of the embedded atom method (EAM). The energy fluctuation, expansion velocity, and products composition in the simulated system were investigated. Overheated state and early expansion shock were observed in the simulation. It is shown that this method can simulate the slow mode electric explosive of metal wire (EEW) effectively.
981	<strong>Kapitza Resistance for Nanoscale Crystalline and Amorphous Silicon Carbide</strong>	Due to the phonon mean free path approaching or overpassing typical characteristic dimension in nanomaterials, thermal transport across interfaces can dictate the overall thermal resistance in nanosystems. However, the fundamental mechanisms at nanoscale interfaces are difficult to predict and control since the thermal boundary conductance across interfaces is intimately related to the characteristics of the interface. In this paper, the thermal boundary resistance (Kapitza resistance) of a crystalline and amorphous silicon carbide(SiC&#xFF09;heterojunction has been investigated by using Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that Kapitza resistance at crystalline and amorphous SiC interface depends on the interfacial coupling strength remarkably. In other words, Kapitza resistance in the strong interfacial coupling is significantly lower than that in weak coupling. The thickness of the heterojunction and temperature dependence of Kapitza resistance have also been examined. The results have shown that the Kapitza resistance decreases monotonically with the increase of temperature (from 300K to 800K). Moreover, Kapitza resistance can be effectively tuned by cross-plane strain. A 5% compressive strain is able to reduce the Kapitza resistance by 380% and 50%, respectively, in weak and strong coupling case. In contrast, a 5% tensile strain can increase Kapitza resistance by 13% and 35%, respectively, with weak and strong interfacial coupling. Our study provides useful guidance to control phonon scattering and thermal transport for the design of nano-electronics devices, in particular, for crystalline and amorphous silicon carbide nanosystems.
982	Spin transition of ferropericlase under shock compression	Planar shock compression experiments are performed at 9-105 GPa on polycrystalline ferropericlase (Mg<sub>0.94</sub>Fe<sub>0.06</sub>)O to investigate its Fe<sup>2+</sup> spin transition. Forward and reverse impact configurations are used to obtain Hugoniot and shock-state sound velocities. While wave profiles, shock velocity-particle velocity and pressure-density measurements show negligible/weak indications of a phase transition, the shock-state sound speed data manifest clearly a phase transition in the range of 36-62 GPa at the nanosecond time scales. These shock data reveal the phase transition as the spin transition identified in static compression experiments and first-principles calculations.
983	Time resolved surface photovoltage measurements using a big data capture approach to KPFM	Optoelectronic phenomena in materials such as organic/inorganic hybrid perovskites depend on a complex interplay between fast (electronic) and slower (ionic) processes, which are known to be heavily influenced by structural inhomogeneities such as interfaces and grain boundaries. While Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) is ideally suited to map surface potentials on relevant length scales, it lacks sufficient temporal resolution to extract the meaningful system dynamics. Here, we develop a time resolved surface photovoltage (SPV) measurement based on full information capture of the photodetector stream during open loop Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) operation. G-mode KPFM allows quantification of SPV with microsecond temporal and nanoscale spatial resolution. We demonstrate the advantage of adopting big data analytics including unsupervised clustering methods to quickly discern spatial variability in the information rich SPV dataset. Using this technique, we observe concurrent spatial and fast temporal variations in the SPV generated across a methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) thin film, indicating that structure is likely responsible for the heterogenous behavior.
984	Perspective: Chain dynamics of unfolded and intrinsically disordered proteins from single-molecule FRET spectroscopy	The dynamics of unfolded proteins are important both for the process of protein folding and for the behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins. However, methods for investigating the global chain dynamics of these structurally diverse systems have been limited. A versatile experimental approach is single-molecule spectroscopy in combination with F&#x00F6;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and nanosecond correlation analysis. The concepts of polymer physics offer a powerful framework both for interpreting the results and for understanding and classifying the properties of unfolded and intrinsically disordered proteins. This information on long-range chain dynamics can be complemented with spectroscopic techniques that probe different length- and timescales, and integration of these results greatly benefits from recent advances in molecular simulations. This increasing convergence between experiment, theory, and simulation is thus starting to enable an increasingly detailed view of the dynamics of disordered proteins.
985	Self-removal of Multiple and Multi-size Nanodroplets on Nanostructured Surfaces	Coalescence-induced jumping on superhydrophobic surfaces has attracted extensive interest. It&rsquo;s recently discovered that the spontaneous removal is also possible for the nanodroplets. However, current studies focus on an ideal coalescence of two equally sized nanodroplets, the dynamics of nanodroplets and the mechanism of coalescence are not well understood when considering other practical factors. This work numerically investigated the practical coalescence processes of nanodroplets using molecular dynamics simulation, and systematically discussed the negative effects of nanodroplets number, initial size and initial size ratio by analyzing the variation of jumping velocity and energy conversion efficiency. On the basis of all calculated results, we provided forecasts for jumping velocity and energy conversion efficiency of two coalescing nanodroplets with different sizes, the results show that both the jumping velocity and energy conversion efficiency decrease roughly with increasing nanodroplet size and size ratio. The simulation results in this study demonstrate the possibility of coalescence-induced jumping of multiple nanodroplets with different sizes, and are very useful for predicting jumping velocities for nanodroplets coalescence events.
986	<strong>A miniature fiber-optic high-intensity focused ultrasound device using a candle soot nanoparticles-polydimethylsiloxane composites-coated photoacoustic lens<sup></sup></strong>	We present a miniature fiber-optic ultrasound transmitter for generating high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) based on photoacoustic transduction. The HIFU device consists of a fiber and a photoacoustic lens. We develop a simple fabrication procedure for making the photoacoustic lens, which is coated with candle soot nanoparticles-polydimethylsiloxane composites. The fiber is used to deliver pulsed laser for photoacoustic excitation, which facilitates the use of the HIFU device by eliminating the need of free-space optical alignment. The HIFU device (8.2 mm in diameter) produces focused acoustic pressures up to &gt;30 MPa in peak positive with a tight &minus;6-dB focal volume of ~100 &mu;m and ~500 &mu;m in the lateral and axial directions, respectively. Acoustic cavitation induced by the HIFU device is demonstrated. The miniature HIFU device facilitates handheld operation. It holds promise for clinical applications in intracavitary and intraoperative high-precision HIFU therapy.
987	Application of multiwall carbon nanotubes to conductive manipulation-probe tips for <em>in-situ</em> transmission electron microscopy of nanometer-sized material: Electrical measurement of a silicon nanoparticle	We investigated electrical conduction of an individual nanometer-sized silicon (Si) particle by <em>in-situ</em> transmission electron microscopy using multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) as manipulation-probe tips. MWNTs could be used to manipulate Si nanoparticles individually and act as conductive probes. A Si nanoparticle covered with an amorphous-Si natural oxide layer was sandwiched between the tips of two MWNTs in the microscope and current-voltage properties of the Si nanoparticle were measured. Electrical conduction through the surface oxide layer of the Si nanoparticle was elucidated. The present study showed that the MWNT manipulation-probe tips are feasible tools for manipulating individual nanometer-sized particles and investigating their electrical properties.
988	<strong>Electromigration effect on the surface morphology during the Ge deposition on Si(111) at high temperatures</strong>	The directional atom drift under direct electric current (DC) flowing through a sample is a unique tool for the surface morphology manipulation, which was previously studied in detail for Si surfaces. We show that electromigration can significantly influence the heterostructures growth process. Without electromigration, the surface morphology is formed under the action of two driving forces determined by a surface and strain energy minimization. DC shifts the balance between them in favor of one of them, depending on the DC direction, producing unusual surface nanostructures during the Ge deposition on Si(111) at 850-900 &deg;C.
989	<strong>Electronic, magnetic and transport properties of zigzag silicene nanoribbon adsorbed with Cu atom: A first-principles calculation <sup></sup></strong>	This paper aims to provide a detailed analysis of the electronic, magnetic and spin-dependent transport properties of Cu-adsorbed zigzag silicene nanoribbons within the density functional theory framework. The possibility of diffusion between different stable positions is studied by Nudge Elastic Band (NEB) method. As to zigzag graphene nanoribbons, the center of nearest hexagonal to the edge is the most favorable site for adsorbing Cu atom. Total energy analysis for spin-polarized calculations indicates that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state is the magnetic ground state of zigzag silicene nanoribbons whereas adding the Cu adatom on the near edge yields ferromagnetic (FM) state with the total magnetization about 0.98 . As a consequence of charge transfer from Si atoms to Cu, the spin distribution symmetry of the edges is broken and the spin magnetic moment is considerably localized on the edge without adsorbing. Further verification of the electronic properties is obtained through investigating the conductivity behavior of the device using the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics based on density functional theory with non-equilibrium Green&rsquo;s function included. Although the spin-up current increases with the bias monotonically, a spin negative different resistance phenomenon is observed for spin-down electrons. Additionally, spin up transmission shows higher values in comparison with that for spin down in bias window which leads to the higher current. The results hold promising applications for future nano-electronics and spintronic devices.
990	Flexible, transparent resistive switching device based on topological insulator Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>- organic composite	Two dimensional topological insulator (TIs) bismuth selenide (Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>) nanosheets embedded in Poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA)  are employed for the first time for the resistive switching (RS) application. Hexagonal 2D Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3 </sub>nanosheets (NSs) are synthesized by a simple solvothermal method and combine with PMMA at different weight percentage of 2D Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>. Field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy along with other characterization such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)  &amp; Raman spectroscopy were performed for the characterization of Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3 </sub>@ PMMA hybrid system. Composite was deposited on transparent, flexible PET substrate to form Ag/Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>@PMMA/ITO memory cell.

The device shows a significantly high resistance ratio &gt; 10<sup>3</sup> (R<sub>HRS</sub>/R<sub>LRS</sub>) with high reproducibility over a large number of (10<sup>5</sup>) ac cycles. From the experimental data RS performances are explained by using a charge trapping&ndash;detrapping mechanism. Owing to the increasing interest in flexible electronics, bending tests were carried out at various bending diameters (10-30 mm) to show the mechanical robustness of the proposed device.

992	Development of Nanostructured TiO2 for the Fabrication of Efficient Dye Sensitized Solar Cell:  A Critical Review	The outlay of non-renewable resources is a thoughtful issue and is a big challenge for our civilization at present century. All over the world, countless investigations are going on for renewable alternatives. The Sun is a conspicuous source of clean and cheap energy. One of the prominent routes for the conversion of solar to electrical energy is photo-voltaic technology. Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) are the eco-friendly and economic developments, which may help us to resolve the energy crisis. A DSSC consists of photoanode, photo-sensitizer dye, electrolyte and counter electrode. To develop a proficient photoanode is a big challenge for scientific communities. Presently, various semiconductors include TiO2, Nb2O5, SnO2, and ZnO are used as photoanode. Among them, TiO2 plays lead role owning its low photo-corrosion and excellent optical as well as electrical properties. Hence, this review is about the discussion regarding the researches and developments of various nanostructures (0-D, 1-D, 2-D, 3-D) of TiO2 to fabricate more efficient and environment-friendly DSSCs. Moreover, it was observed that 2-D nanostructures, in particular, mesoporous TiO2 films synthesized by screen printing technique are most suitable and prominent photoanodes for DSSC application.
993	Capacitive and Memristive Behaviours in Metallic Nanowire Networks	Random nanowire networks (NWNs) are promising synthetic architectures for non-volatile memory devices and hardware-based neuromorphic applications due to their history-dependent responses, recurrent connectivity, and neurosynaptic-like behaviours. Such brain-like functions occur due to emergent resistive switching phenomena taking place in the interwire junctions which are viewed as memristive systems; they operate as smart analogue switches whose resistance depends on the history of the input voltage/current. We successfully demonstrated that NWNs made with a particular class of memristive junctions can exhibit a highly-selective conduction mechanism which uses the lowest-energy connectivity path in the network identified as the &ldquo;winner-takes-all&rdquo; state. But these complex networks do not always behave in the same fashion; in the limit of sufficiently low input currents (preceding this selective conduction regime), the system behaves as a leakage capacitive network and its electrical activation is driven by cascades of breakdown-based switching events involving binary capacitive transitions. Understanding these two regimes is crucial to establish the potential of these materials for neuromorphics and for this we present two computational modelling schemes designed to describe the capacitive and memristive responses of NWNs interrogated adiabatically by voltage/current sources. Our findings reveal the fault-tolerant aspect in the slow-switching dynamics of memristive networks in contrast with the abrupt activation response obtained in the fast-switching process of binary capacitive networks. Our results are corroborated by experimental evidence that reveal the fine electrical properties of NWN materials in their respective formation (capacitive) and conducting (memristive) stages.
994	<strong>Study of Electrospun PVA-Based Concentrations Nanofibre Filled with Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or WO<sub>3</sub> as Potential X-ray Shielding Material </strong>	This study was successfully fabricated the electrospun PVA/Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and PVA/WO<sub>3</sub> nanofibre mats with different weight percentages (wt%) of the PVA concentrations with variable wt% of filler loading (Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and WO<sub>3</sub>) from 0 &ndash; 40wt%. The characterisation of the electrospun composite samples was evaluated and analysed for the purposes of the X-ray shielding criteria such as density, thickness and mass attenuation coefficient ( . Besides that, the characteristics of the surface morphology and the dispersion patterns of the nanoparticles inside the PVA nanofibres were also been performed by using SEM. In addition, the effect of X-ray energies prior to the X-ray attenuation was determined by using XRF for the energy between 8.64 &ndash; 25.20 keV. Other than that, electrospun 15PVA with 35wt% of the Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> showed the high value of  when being tested for all type of X-ray energies compared to other electrospun composite samples. In contrast, WO<sub>3</sub> filler showed the lowest  compared to the Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> filler even though they were embedded into the same PVA concentration. This was due to the higher atomic number (Z) of the Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> compared to WO<sub>3</sub>. As a conclusion, the higher density of the sample, the higher probability of the X-ray photon being attenuated by the sample. Moreover, the SEM image elucidated the smaller number of fibre diameter, less number of agglomeration and bead formations occurred within the nanofibres for 15PVA with 35wt% of the Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, thus was chosen as the best potential of the X-ray attenuation shielding material candidate for the X-ray shielding applications.
995	<strong>Electromigration effect on the surface morphology during the Ge deposition on Si(111) at high temperatures</strong>	The directional atom drift under direct electric current (DC) flowing through a sample is a unique tool for the surface morphology manipulation, which was previously studied in detail for Si surfaces. We show that electromigration can significantly influence the heterostructures growth process. Without electromigration, the surface morphology is formed under the action of two driving forces determined by a surface and strain energy minimization. DC shifts the balance between them in favor of one of them, depending on the DC direction, producing unusual surface nanostructures during the Ge deposition on Si(111) at 850-900 &deg;C.

The electron-phonon relaxation lifetime, measured by pump-probe in near-infrared wavelength (1550 nm), is changed from 1.49 ps to 0.85 ps with the value of X from 3 to 0. It proves indirectly the previous conclusion that the increase of Se atoms could enhanced the thermal effects.

997	<strong>The influence of nickel oxide nanoparticle dispersion on the thermo stability of lubricant oil </strong>	The homogeneous and substantial dispersion of nanoparticles into base fluids is vital since the final properties of any nanolubricants are estimated by their quality of stability. This paper addresses the study on the effect of NiO nanoparticles dispersion into SN500 lubricant oil on its non-isothermal thermo stability. The dispersion of NiO nanoparticles is achieved by ultrasonication method. The thermo stability is estimated by Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and Differential Scanning Colorimety (DSC). The result shows that the thermo stability of base fluid enhances up to 0.3 wt% particle concentration then it decreases due to agglomeration of dispersed nanoparticles. The findings recommend that 0.1 wt% and 0.3 wt% of NiO-nanolubricant can be used for the temperature dependent applications up to 200 &deg;C.
998	<strong>Enhanced bremsstrahlung X-ray emission from Ag nanoparticles irradiated by ultrashort laser pulses</strong>	<em>A thin planar water jet containing Ag nanoparticles (20 nm size) is irradiated by ultrashort (150 fs) laser pulses of intensity ~ 10<sup>15 </sup>W/cm<sup>2</sup> to produce bremsstrahlung X-rays of up to 100 keV photon energy. An enhancement of 30-fold is observed in the X-ray yield compared to the precursor salt solution. This is a consequence of the surface plasmon assisted local electric field enhancement in the nanoparticles, resulting in enhanced multiphoton ionization. Continuous circulation of the nanoparticles through the liquid jet ensures long-term stability towards laser irradiation. In comparison, only an 18-fold enhancement of X-ray yield is measured in Au NPs, when measured under identical conditions. The relatively lower ionization potential of Ag nanoparticles makes them better candidates for bright X- ray generation, with variety of applications including dynamics studies, microscopy, and lithography.</em>
999	Stable plasmon excitations in quantum nanowires	Stable electrostatic plasmon excitations due to propagation of Gaussian electron pulse are studied in a cylindrical nanowire of radius "a" and length "L". For this purpose, we consider conduction electrons that follow the quantum hydrodynamical model to account for quantum statistics, quantum diffraction and exchange-correlation effects in the presence of classical static ions. The use of well-known Fourier transform technique and Trivelpiece-Gould configuration leads to the generalized dispersion for plasmon with finite mode quantization effects via the radial and azimuthal mode indices, as well with quantum settings. The excitations of plasmon wakefield appear when the electron beam propagates with a constant velocity along the axial direction of nanowire. The stability conditions are also analyzed for the existentence of wakefield excitations by solving three important inequalities using typical parameters of gold nanowire. The results may prove useful for understanding the plasmon excitations in quantum nanowires, where electrons can be trapped and accelerated in the wakefield to emit radiation in the extreme-ultraviolet range.
1000	<strong>Surface morphology formation of Ti films in laser induced forward transfer</strong>	Titanium is frequently adopted in laser induced forward transfer (LIFT) due to its unique industrial advantages (low density, high specific strength and good corrosion resistance). To understand the LIFT process assisted with Ti films, topographies of on Ti films with a thickness  irradiated by ultraviolet nanosecond laser pulses are investigated. Five different topographies (the pit, blister, bump, spray and strip) are observed and classified, among which the pit, with the film surface sinks in the center, is first addressed in this work. Probability distribution of these types with respect to laser fluence on 435 nm and 1250 nm Ti films is provided and an analytical model is developed to explain the driving mechanism of the ablation threshold and the formation of different topographies.
1001	Culturing and patch clamping single cells on nanowire substrates	Nanowire substrates play an increasingly important role for cell cultures as an ap- proach for hybrid junctions between semiconductors and biological systems. In order to establish such a setup, we address the question if high density vertical nanowire substrates can serve as culturing substrate for Jurkat T lymphocytes and cerebellar neurons from mice, while fundamental electrophysiological properties remain con- served. The electrophysiological responses of the cells cultured on highly ordered and randomly distributed nanowires covered in a thin aluminum oxide passivation layer are compared to planar control substrates. Patch clamp recordings on each sub- strate performed with a custom-built upright patch clamp setup to handle opaque substrates show similar electrophysiological properties, such as resting membrane potential, membrane capacitance and specific ion channel gating. Cross sections pre- pared with focused ion beam are used examine the membrane nanowire interface at the nanowire tip and show a wrapping of the very tip the the nanowires. The similar electrophysiological activity demonstrates that the characteristic of the nanowire sub- strate plays a subordinate role and opens up the arena for a large range of nanowire substrates in a functionalized application.
1002	Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance on Two-Dimensional Monolayer and Multilayer HfSe<sub>2</sub>	In this work, we theoretically evaluated localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excited on two-dimensional (2D) monolayer and multilayer semiconducting HfSe<sub>2</sub>, and quantitatively compared the in-plane and out-of-plane anisotropic properties. The LSPR was excited by Au sphere nanoparticles on 2D HfSe<sub>2</sub>, and its properties including internal field, polarizability, scattering and absorption cross-section, and radiative efficiency <em>etc.</em> were analyzed using Mie theory. Due to the unique anisotropic nature of 2D HfSe<sub>2</sub>, the LSPR excited on the monolayer HfSe<sub>2</sub> was clearly observed in the in-plane direction but effectively suppressed in the out-of-plane direction. In contrast, for the multilayer HfSe<sub>2</sub>, the LSPR showed a very comparable response in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, suggesting an isotropic-like light-matter interaction. In addition to this unique anisotropy-to-isotropy transition as the layer number increases, a red-shift of the LSPR wavelength was also found. Our work has demonstrated the unique anisotropic light-matter interaction on the monolayer HfSe<sub>2</sub> and the isotropic-like interaction on the multilayer HfSe<sub>2</sub>, which holds great potential for broad photonic and optoelectronic applications such as sensing, imaging, light concentration, and energy conversion <em>etc</em>.
1003	Nondestructive high-speed fiber laser shock processing of Al alloys	Laser induced shock wave processing has aroused a special interest in the micro/nano machining fields, while the low processing efficiency and the difficult control of the shock wave are the bottleneck problems impeding its practical applications. In this study, a nondestructive high-speed fiber laser shock processing (FLSP) technique was researched to improve the performance of the micro/nano shock machining. A laminar-flow-based high-speed FLSP system was developed using a galvanometer scanner and a compact fiber laser with less than 1 mJ pulse energy. Nondestructive microdent arrays with adjustable depths (200 ~ 1000 nm) in nano-scale precision have been achieved on Al alloy surfaces in a large scale (20 mm &#x00D7; 20 mm) with a shock processing rate of 1 kHz. The processing efficiency can be further improved up to hundreds of times with the extension of the processing area. An obvious increase in surface microhardness of 19% and a generation of compressive residual stress of -140 MPa were also observed. The effect of impact times, peak power densities, pulse durations, sacrificial coating thickness, and water-flow rates was systematically investigated. The results laid the groundwork for the practical application of FLSP in the micro/nano machining.
1004	Roll-to-roll fabrication of hierarchical superhydrophobic surfaces	In this letter, we report a roll-to-roll fabrication method to develop a hierarchical nanopatterened superhydrophobic surface. The hierarchical pattern includes a primary micropattern with an overlayed secondary nanopattern. The primary pattern of 15 - 30 microns length scales was fabricated through UV nanoimprint lithography. The secondary nanopattern of 20 nm size was generated through a subsequent scalable spray coating with hydrophobic silica nanoparticles to create a nanoscale random roughness over the primary pattern. The secondary nanocoating over primary pattern resulted in enhanced contact angle resulting in superhydrophobicity and reduced hysteresis. Freezing droplet measurements performed, demonstrated a five-fold increase in the time for the droplet to freeze on a superhydrophobic surface compared to a primary hydrophobic structure.
1005	Fermi level tuning of <u>resistive</u> switching behavior of graphite/Nb$:$<u>SrTiO</u>$_3$ interfaces	Layered electrodes based on <u>graphene</u> or transition metal <u>dichalcogenides</u> have enriched the development of <u>nanoelectronics</u> due to their uniqueness in flexibility, transparency, thermal stability and electronic structure. Here we report on the <u>resistive</u> switching behaviors observed in graphite/Nb:<u>SrTiO<sub>3</sub></u> (Gr/<u>NbSTO</u>) junctions. Straightforward <em>in <u>situ</u></em> bromine <u>intercalation</u> of graphite modulates the transport properties of Gr/<u>NbSTO</u> devices, an effect which cannot be achieved using traditional metal electrodes. At low temperatures, the strong electric field dependence of the dielectric constant of Nb:<u>SrTiO</u>3 is also plays an important role in further enhancing the <u>resistive</u> switching performance. Our findings here suggest that to optimize the performance and to perform more complex functions, <u>tunability</u> of the Fermi level of the layered graphite electrode in combination with the nonlinear dielectric constant of the <u>NbSTO</u> substrate are critically important for interface-type <u>resistive</u> switching devices.
1006	<strong>Bipolar to unipolar mode transition and imitation of metaplasticity in oxide based memristors with enhanced ionic conductivity</strong>	Neuromorphic engineering offers a promising route toward intelligent and low power computing systems that may find applications in artificial intelligence and internet of things. Construction of neuromorphic systems, however, requires scalable nanodevices that could implement the key functionalities of biological synapses. Here we demonstrate an artificial synaptic device consisting of a Ti/yttria-stabilized-zirconia (ZrO<sub>2</sub>:Y)/Pt memristive structure, where the loss microstructure, high oxygen vacancy concentration and resultant high ionic conductivity in ZrO<sub>2</sub>:Y facilitate the oxygen vacancy migration and filament evolution in the devices, leading to a bipolar artificial synapse with low forming and operation voltages. As the thickness of ZrO<sub>2</sub>:Y film increases, a transition from bipolar to unipolar resistive switching was observed, which can be ascribed to the competing vertical and radial ion transport dynamics. The emergence of unipolar switching has in turn allowed the device to exhibit metaplasticity, a history dependent plasticity that is important for memory and learning functions. This work thus demonstrates on-demand manipulation of ionic transport properties for building synaptic elements with rich functionalities.
1007	Quantized optical near-field interactions measured with a superconducting nanowire detector	The quantum nature of optical near-fields is interesting from a theoretical perspective and of importance for practical applications, such as high-resolution imaging, sensing and antenna-coupled quantum light sources. In this work we use a custom-designed superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) to directly read out the near-field interaction between source and detector. We use a subwavelength-sized aperture at the end of an optical fiber to record spatial near-field maps and to measure the distance dependence of the optical near-field interaction. Our measurements can be well described by a superposition of evanescent source fields with no noticeable probe-sample coupling. Our approach can be used for further studies of quantum near-field interactions and for the development of near-field imaging techniques with single quantum sensitivity.
1008	<strong>Multiple Internal Resonances in MEMS Arch Resonators</strong>	Micromachined shallow arch resonant beams have attracted significant attention thanks to their rich dynamical behavior, inherent nonlinearities, and the potential to excite various internal resonances. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive experimental studies for the various types of internal resonances in arches and particularly at the micro and nano scales. Here, we aim to investigate and identify different types of internal resonances of an initially curved beam, electrothermally actuated and electrostatically driven, by electrical characterization techniques. Upon changing the electrothermal voltage of silicon micromachined arches, the second symmetric natural frequency of an arch is adjusted to near twice, three times, and four times the fundamental natural frequency, which gives rise to 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1 autoparametric resonances between the two modes. These resonances are demonstrated experimentally. We show various frequency-response curves of the total response around the excitation frequency and highlight the contribution of each mode before, during, and after the internal resonances. Allan-deviation results are also shown indicating enhanced frequency stabilization of the arch oscillation when experiencing internal resonances. These studies motivate further research in this direction to exploit internal resonances of micromachined resonators for practical applications, such as sensors and mechanical amplifier.
1009	Fast water flow through nanocapillaries: a continuum model approach involving the microscopic structure of confined water	Water inside a nanocapillary becomes ordered, resulting in unconventional behavior. A profound enhancement of water flow inside nanometer thin capillaries made of carbon nanotubes or graphene has been observed. Here we explain these enhancement to the large density and the extraordinary viscosity of water inside the nanocapillaries. Using the Hagen-Poiseuille theory with slippage-boundary condition {and incorporating disjoining pressure term in combination with} extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we present an analytical theory that elucidates the origin of the enhancement of water flow inside hydrophobic nanocapillaries. Additionally, we determine the contact angle of water inside nanocapillaries to be very close to 90$^o$ {and a slip length of about 600&Aring;. Our work reveals a very distinctive dependence of water flow in a nanocapillary on the structural properties of nanoconfined water in agreement with experiment, which opens a new avenue in nanofluidics.
1010	High temperature magnetic studies on Bi<sub>1-<em>x</em></sub>Ca<em><sub>x</sub></em>Fe<sub>1-<em>y</em></sub>Ti<em><sub>y</sub></em>O<sub>3-</sub><sub>d</sub> nanoparticles: Observation of Hopkinson-like effect above T<sub>N</sub>	Magnetic properties of Bi<sub>1-<em>x</em></sub>Ca<em><sub>x</sub></em>Fe<sub>1-<em>y</em></sub>Ti<em><sub>y</sub></em>O<sub>3-</sub><sub>d </sub>(BCFO: <em>y</em>=0 and BCFTO: <em>x</em>=<em>y</em>) nanoparticles are studied across a wide range of temperatures (20 K to 960 K) for different Ca (and Ti) concentrations [<em>x</em> (= <em>y</em>) = 0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1]. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy revealed gradual emergence of orthorhombic phase (P<em>nma</em>) with increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> content in BCFO, contrary to the retention of parent rhombohedral symmetry (<em>R3c</em>) in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Ti<sup>4+</sup> co-doped BCFTO. XPS indicates the presence of 3+ valence states for Bi and Fe, and under-coordinated defect peaks in O 1<em>s</em> spectra. Ordering of oxygen vacancies in BCFO affect the FeO<sub>6</sub> octahedral alignment resulting in a systematic shift of Fe-O Raman modes. Oxygen vacancies formed due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> doping in BCFO, and non-magnetic Ti<sup>4+ </sup>ion at Fe<sup>3+</sup> site in BCFTO disrupt the spin-cycloid propagation in BiFeO<sub>3</sub>, largely influencing the magnetic properties. These substitutional changes, in addition to the large surface area, are the sources of net magnetization in these systems. Magnetic hysteresis and field dependent ZFC-FC curves indicate the combined presence of anti-ferromagnetic and ferromagnetic components in BCFO and BCFTO nanoparticles. High temperature magnetic studies present a clear bifurcation of magnetic N&eacute;el transition centered at ~ 600 K associated to the structural variation in BCFO. A strong anomaly observed at 860 &plusmn; 40 K in all the samples suggest a Hopkinson-like effect arising due to sudden loss of anisotropy by the FM component.
1011	<SPAN style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Enhancement and Reduction of Thermal Conduction </SPAN> <SPAN style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">via Phonon Spectral Coupling</SPAN>	We demonstrate a new approach to enhance and reduce thermal conductivities in layered nanostructures by using a novel understanding of phonon spectral coupling. We uncover the underlying phonon injection mechanisms and show the determining role of layer spacings and interface properties in obtaining thermal conductivity modulations. We show that the thermal conductivity of an embedded Ge film between Si cladding layers can be enhanced beyond its free-standing thin-film value. The same mechanism in a modified architecture can also be used to reduce the thermal conductivity of a Si thin-film below its free-standing value. The results of this work open new avenues within the rational thermal design by creating a new method to increase and reduce thermal conductivities, and advance the basic understanding of nanoscale thermal transport by incorporating the role of phonon spectral coupling. The prospects of being able to modulate the thermal conductivity can radically change how we control heat flow in electronic, optoelectronic, and thermoelectric materials.
1012	Two-Dimensional Multiferroic Semiconductors with Coexisting Ferroelectricity and Ferromagnetism	Low-dimensional multiferroicity, though highly scarce in nature, has attracted great attention due to both fundamental and technological interests. Using a combination of first-principles calculations and Landau theoretical analysis, we show that ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity can coexist in four monolayer transition metal phosphorus chalcogenides (TMPCs) CuCrP<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub>, CuCrP<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>6</sub>, CuVP<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub>, and CuVP<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>6</sub>, which represent the first class of 2D multiferroic semiconductors that simultaneously possess ferroelectric and ferromagnetic orders. In these monolayer materials, Cu atoms spontaneously move away from the center atomic plane, resulting in finite electric dipole moment along the plane normal, while ferromagnetism originates from the indirect exchange interaction between Cr/V atoms. The out-of-plane ferroelectricity in these semiconducting 2D TMPC crystals allows for facile control of electric polarization by external vertical electric field and opens up avenues for realizing 2D nanoscale switching and memory devices patterned with top and bottom electrodes.
1013	The role of ultrasound in surface modification of CuO nanoparticles and synthesis of poly)vinyl chloride)/CuO-BSA nanocomposites: Characterization and physicochemical properties	The main aim of this project is the improvement of physicochemical properties of poly)vinyl chloride) (PVC) through combining it with copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs). For this purpose, at first, Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as a biocompatible coupling agent was used for the surface modification of the CuO NPs. Then, nanocomposite (NC) films with different percentages of CuO-BSA (3, 6, and 9 wt%) were fabricated by using ultrasonication method following by solution casting technique. Finally, the prepared samples were studied by different characterization techniques including Fourier transform infrared spectra, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The aforementioned techniques revealed that the reinforcing of PVC with CuO-BSA NPs led to the improvement of some physicochemical properties of the PVC/CuO-BSA NCs such as mechanical, thermal, optical, and hydrophilicity.
1014	A plantar pressure sensing system with balancing sensitivity based on tailored MWCNTs/PDMS composites	This paper presents a flexible plantar pressure sensor with simple structure and easy accessibility suited for everyday use. In this study, the design, fabrication and characteristics of both the composite and the sensor are involved. By using the solution method, the piezoresistive composite is fabricated by uniform dispersion of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix. The proposed sensor consists eight sensing elements with a laminated structure. The upper layer is the sensing layer made of the piezoresistive composite, and the lower layer is a flexible printed circuit board working as electrodes. A particular design of sensing elements is carried out by using different doping concentrations according to the arrangement positions under the feet to obtain a balancing sensitivity. A signal processing system to convert the variable resistance signal into the voltage by current-to-voltage method is designed. Experimental results prove that the designed sensor shows repeatable response with a sensitivity of 11.5 mV/kPa within the range of 260 kPa. Also, an actual application verifies that the designed plantar pressure sensor can measure the pressure under the foot and can be used for gait detection and disease diagnosis purposes.
1015	Experimental study on the discharge ignition in a capillary discharge based pulsed plasma thruster	Low power capillary discharge based pulsed plasma thrusters (CDPPTs) are electrothermally dominated thrusters and they have aroused renewed interest in the investigation and enhancement of the basic performance for the application of mi-cro/nano satellites recently. Research on the ignition mechanism of a CDPPT has been conducted to provide insight into the optimization of the structure design and promotion of the lifetime performance. It has been found that the electrical parame-ters, geometry parameters and the cumulative effect of discharge jointly determine the discharge ignition characteristics. A single ignition process is divided into the breakdown of igniter and the development of the main discharge, while the results shows that the jitter of the ignition delay time is mainly introduced from the former. Shorter ignition delay time and lower jitter are obtained with a higher ignition energy and main charging voltage or a shorter and narrower cavity, which is positively correlated to the electric field distribution along the propellant surface. Moreover, with long duration experiments, the surface deposits and morphology of propellant and igniter are the dominant factors that cause the dispersity of the ignition effect and main discharge characteristics.
1016	<strong>Ferromagnetic Resonance in Coupled Magnetic Nanostructured Arrays </strong>	The modulated field sweep ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy was used to study the magnetization dynamics in large arrays of interacting cubic nanomagnets. A 60nm thick Permalloy (Ni<sub>80</sub>Fe<sub>20</sub>) thin films were patterned into several large arrays of 60 x 60 nm<sup>2</sup> nanostructures where the spacing between the magnetic nanocubes was varied to control the strength of dipolar coupling. The films were deposited using magnetron sputtering and patterned with electron beam lithography. DC magnetic properties were evaluated using alternating gradient force magnetometer (AGFM). In the FMR measurements, the orientation of DC bias magnetic field was varied from the in-plane to out-of-plane with respect to the 2D plane of the arrays. The FMR peak splitting and multiple FMR modes were observed in the evolution of the FMR spectra as the function of the bias field orientation, and were strongly influenced by the nanomagnet geometry and the spacing between the nanomagnets. Two resonance modes, shape and lattice, were particularly well pronounced in the observed FMR spectra. These modes are characterized by effective demagnetizing factors representing different symmetries of the system of interacting nanomagnets. Micromagnetic modeling suggest that micromagnetic texture within the nanomagnets modulated by the stray fields from the neighbors correlates with the FMR spectra.
1017	<strong>Tutorial: Fabrication and Three-Dimensional Integration of Nanoscale Memristive Devices and Arrays<sup></sup></strong>	To accelerate neural networks with growing complexity, hybrid integrated systems with high-density nanoscale memristive devices are in huge demand. In this Tutorial, we first introduce the methodology in fabrication of memristor crossbars with sub-10 nm feature size, including nanoimprint lithography that provides excellent resolution at low cost. Technical issues in the fabrication process such as critical dimension (CD) control, overlay alignment accuracy and reliable mold cleaning are discussed in detail. On the other hand, as lateral scaling becomes more challenging, three-dimensional (3D) integration presents an alternative solution to further increase the packing density, and to implement new functionalities. Some early demonstrations of 3D hybrid circuits are reviewed and fabrication related issues are discussed. Successful implementation of large-scale 3D memristive system will enable new technologies in future computing applications.
1018	<strong>Effect of water vapor on the thermal resistance between amorphous silica nanoparticles </strong>	Nanoparticle-based materials are of interest because of their unique thermal properties. Possessing the lowest thermal conductivities of any solid materials known, they have been widely used as insulating materials. However, the presence of water vapor has been shown to a large influence on those properties. In this work, we investigate the effect of water vapor on the heat transfer between nanoparticles using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. We calculate the total thermal resistance and thermal boundary resistance between adjacent amorphous spherical silica nanoparticles, when water molecules are allowed to diffuse as vapor into the interstitial pores between particles. The thermal resistance between nanoparticles is shown to decrease rapidly when water vapor is introduced into the pores between particles. The largest decrease in interparticle resistance occurs as a result of the silanization of the silica particle surfaces.  A secondary decrease is attributable to the liquid bridge that forms as water molecules condense around the contact point between nanoparticles. Most of the decrease in resistance between nanoparticles occurs when water vapor is first introduced at relative humidities (rh) of less than 1%. As relative humidity increases above 1%, the interparticle thermal resistance decreases more slowly, approaching a constant value near 50% rh. Numerical results are compared to experimental measurements of heat transfer across packed beds of 20 nm silica nanoparticles exposed to water vapor. The simulation results are shown to be consistent with the experimental measurements for relative humidities below 15% rh, while underpredicting the experimental measurements above 15% rh.
1019	Suppression of Walker breakdown in gapped magnetic nanowires	We report our numerical study on efficient and controllable suppression of the Walker breakdown along nanowires by positioning nanogaps with periodicity matching to that of transformational spin structure of magnetic domain wall. While the Walker breakdown is suppressed, the transverse spin<br />structure is found to be stably maintained without formation of antivortex core throughout the propagation, shedding a light in faster spintronic devices based on the domain wall motion.
1020	<strong>Influence of Ni-Zn-Cu-Ferrite on Electroactive &beta;</strong><strong>-Phase</strong><strong> in </strong><strong>Poly(vinylidene fluoride)-</strong><strong>Ni-Zn-Cu-Ferrite Nanocomposite Film: Unique Metamaterial for Enhanced Microwave Absorption</strong>	In search of a new radar absorbing material for microwave applications Ni<sub>0.40</sub>Zn<sub>0.40</sub>Cu<sub>0.20</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (NZCF) nanoparticles are successfully incorporated in the matrix of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and this NZCF-PVDF nanocomposite system has evolved as the potential one for absorbing radiations in the microwave/GHz frequency range. The enhancement of electroactive &beta;-phase of PVDF has been observed in the NZCF-PVDF nanocomposite system due to the formation of NZCF-PVFD interfaces. Also, magnetic dipoles of ferrite nanoparticles are present in the same resultant nanocomposite system. Both these two factors will play the significant role for the interaction of microwave radiation with the medium of NZCF-PVDF nanocomposite system. The optimization of wave matter interaction leads to the superior reflection loss property of the NZCF-PVDF nanocomposite system. The simultaneous contributions of both magnetic nano-fillers and polar PVDF polymer makes this NZCF-PVDF nanocomposite system a unique metamaterial for enhanced microwave absorption. Many articles have been published on polymer-ferrite/hexaferrite systems but in true sense the involvement of NZCF-PVFD interfaces as the active centre during wave matter interaction has not been considered by anyone else. Reflection loss property for all the NZCF-PVDF nanocomposite films has been observed and a maximum of -49.7 dB at 13.2 GHz is obtained for 10 weight % of NZCF loaded PVDF nanocomposite film. This is basically the highest reflection loss ever found in these types of polymer based metamaterials. Also, the high value of reflection loss in NZCF-PVDF nanocomposite films (X and K<sub>u</sub> bands) makes them most suitable one for the applications in microwave devices.
1021	<strong>Structure transformation of sp3 carbon assisted carbon nanotube growth</strong>	In this study, we investigated the effect of hydrocarbon composition on carbon nanotube (CNT) growth using an iron catalyst via the thermal chemical vapor deposition process. The presence of atomic hydrogen and active carbon species appeared to be essential for nucleation and growth of CNT arrays. With increasing in atomic hydrogen content, the interface layer distance of the CNTs decreased from 3.7 to 3.4 &Aring;. The shifts in the G-band in the Raman spectra of the CNTs indicated that the hydrogen atoms affected the generation of C&ndash;C bonds in graphene layers.
1022	Negative Photoconductivity of WS<sub>2</sub> Nanosheets Decorated with Au Nanoparticles	Tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>) nanosheets (NSs) decorated with Au nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by sputtering and electron beam irradiation, and the effect of the Au NP decoration on the photoresponse of the WS<sub>2</sub> NSs was investigated. The WS<sub>2</sub> NSs decorated with Au NPs showed photoresponsivity of 39.9 mA&middot;W<sup>-1</sup>, which was 25.7 times higher than the WS<sub>2</sub> NSs without Au NPs decoration. With the Au NP decoration, the change from positive photoconductivity to negative photoconductivity (NPC) was observed under 450-nm laser illumination. However, compared with the WS<sub>2</sub> NSs without an Au NP decoration, the WS<sub>2</sub> NSs decorated with Au NPs showed longer rising and falling times of 18 and 468 s, respectively. The origin of the enhanced photoresponse and NPC for the WS<sub>2</sub> NSs decorated with Au NPs were investigated. A finite-difference time-domain calculation was conducted, and an NPC mechanism based on electron trapping was proposed.
1023	<strong>Construction and characterization of </strong><strong>ZnFe<sub>2-x</sub>Eu<sub>x</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@mTiO<sub>2</sub>@N-GQDs Biocompatible Nano-devices for Smart Drug Release with pH and Microwave Irradiation</strong>	In the present study a pH/microwave-responsive drug smart nano-device based on superparamagnetic core-shell ZnFe<sub>2-x</sub>Eu<sub>x</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@mTiO<sub>2</sub>@N-GQDs ternary nano-hybrids (TNHs) and ZnFe<sub>2-x</sub>Eu<sub>x</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@mTiO<sub>2</sub> binary nano-hybrids (BNHs) was prepared. The smart nano-device composed of a superparamagnetic ZnFe<sub>2-x</sub>Eu<sub>x</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>core and mesoporous TiO<sub>2 </sub>(m TiO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) interlayer shell which was synthesized by a facile sol-gel and/or sono-chemical method. These nano-devices were used for pH/microwave-controllable doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) release. These nano-devices was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), photoluminescence spectra (PL), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and zeta potential value. The in vitro cytotoxicity testing exhibited negligible cytotoxicity of as-prepared nano-devices even at the concentration as high as 150 &mu;g/mL. The DOX (an anticancer drug) loading capacity of this nano-device was as high as 1.81 mg/mg. The  loaded  DOX  can  be  sustainably  smart released,  which  was  apt  to  be  controlled  by  microwave irradiation and pH adjustment. Thus, this core-interlayer-shell TNHs was suitable for in vivo biomedical targeting delivery and controlled DOX release using pH and microwave irradiation.
1024	Impact of Varying Strain Energy in Oxide on the Random Telegraphic Noise and Time Constants in Narrow Diameter Silicon Nanowire p-MOSFETs	Multi-level random telegraphic noise (RTN) in 15 nm diameter gate-all-around (GAA) silicon nanowire p-MOSFET shows gate voltage overdrive dependent inter-state transitions, statistical count of which indicates existence of oxide traps having different time constants. Following detail extraction of the capture and emission times with gate bias, we have found both to deviate from the usual trend, as predicted by the conventional Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) statistics. Two traps in the gate oxide have been found, in which the near interface is found to respond through the altered RTN activation energy barrier by spatially varying oxide residual strain energy, whereas the farther is found to respond under the weak influence of the oxide strain energy. On the other hand, emission time of near interface trap has been found to follow similar strain influenced activation barrier, but magnitude of the emission time of the farther trap shows hole emission through the p+ polysilicon gate-oxide interfacial trap, aided by electrostatic field in oxide. From RTN distributions and time lag plots, inter-state transitions and state suppression in RTN are explained under the framework of two trap postulate, in order to elucidate unusual gate bias dependency of the measured trap time constants in silicon nanowire MOSFETs
1025	Direct Hydroxylation of Benzene to Phenol Mediated by Nanosized Vanadium Oxide Cluster Ions at Room Temperature	Gas-phase vanadium oxide cluster cations and anions are prepared by laser ablation. The small cluster ions (&lt; 1000 amu) are mass-selected using a quadruple mass filter and reacted with benzene in a linear ion trap reactor; large clusters (&gt; 1000 amu) with no mass selection are reacted with C6H6 in a fast flow reactor. Rich product variety is encountered in these reactions, and the reaction channels for small cationic and anionic systems are different. For large clusters, the reactivity patterns of (V2O5)n+ (n = 6-25) and (V2O5)nO- (n = 6-24) cluster series are very similar to each other, indicating that charge state has little influence on the oxidation of benzene. In sharp contrast to the dramatic changes of reactivity of small clusters, a weakly size dependent reaction behavior of large (V2O5)6-25+ and (V2O5)6-24O- clusters is observed. Therefore, the charge state and the size are not the major factors influencing the reactivity of nanosized vanadium oxide cluster ions toward C6H6, which is not common in cluster science. In the reactions with benzene, the small and large reactive vanadium oxide cations parallel similar reactivity of hydroxyl radicals (OH&#x2022;) toward C6H6 at higher and lower temperatures, respectively; different numbers of vibrational degree of freedoms and the released energy during the formation of adduct complexes can explain this intriguing correlation. The reactions investigated herein might be used as the models of how to realize the partial oxidation of benzene to phenol in a single step, and the observed mechanisms are helpful to understand the corresponding heterogeneous reactions, such as those over vanadium oxide aerosols and vanadium oxide catalysts.
1026	Investigation of the temperature dependence of random telegraph noise fluctuations in nanoscale polysilicon-channel 3-D Flash cells	By gathering statistical data from the floating-gate cells in a state-of-the-art 3-Dimensional (3-D) NAND Flash memory array, in this letter we explore the temperature dependence of random telegraph noise (RTN) fluctuations in nanoscale polysilicon-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors. Experimental results highlight some major differences in the RTN temperature behavior with respect to monocrystalline silicon devices. In particular, not only the time constants but also the amplitude of RTN fluctuations appear to significantly change with temperature, with the latter displaying an average increase when temperature is reduced. The change of the fluctuation amplitude with temperature is correlated neither with the fluctuation time constants nor with their activation energy. Results are explained in terms of a more relevant role played by polysilicon grain boundaries when temperature is reduced, leading to a more percolative conduction in the transistor channel and to a stronger impact on the source-to-drain current of RTN traps placed close to the grain boundaries. These results should be carefully considered when attempting spectroscopic investigations based on the assumption, valid for monocrystalline devices, that only the time constants and not the amplitude of RTN flutuations change with temperature.
1027	<strong>&ldquo;Planetary&rdquo; silver nanoparticles held in orbit by electric charge</strong>	In a gas aggregation cluster source, nanoparticles are formed by aggregation of single atoms to particles as well as by agglomeration of smaller particles to form larger particles. Because the small particles are often electrically charged, it is possible that particles are mutually attracted or repelled by electric forces. In this work we report the observation of &ldquo;planetary&rdquo; bound multi-particle systems which are the result of the electrical and centrifugal forces acting on nanoparticles in a magnetron sputtering cluster source. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of deposited &ldquo;planetary&rdquo; nanoparticle systems exhibit characteristic interparticle distances and sizes, as well as different charge states of the particles. Simulations confirm the presence of stable planetary nanoparticle systems up to at least 6/7 satellites. The discovery of such &ldquo;planetary&rdquo; nanoparticle systems inside a cluster source opens up possibilities for more research into their properties and how they can be further controlled and explored.
1028	Density and viscosity profiles governing nanochannel flow	The density and viscosity profiles across the nanochannel height were respectively compared between the flow factor approach model and molecular dynamics simulation for the Poiseuille flow in a nanochannel, when the agreements between these two approaches were good in calculating both the flow velocity profile across the channel height and the volume flow rate through the channel. It was found that except close to the confining wall, the comparisons in the two regards showed satisfactory agreements; Because of the solidification of the thin layer close to the wall, the errors of the flow factor approach model in calculating both the local density and local viscosity close to the wall can not considerably affect its calculation accuracy of both the flow velocity profile across the channel height and the volume flow rate through the channel, both of which were actually governed by the density and viscosity profiles of the flowing media in the middle section of the channel height.

1030	Topology Optimization of 3-Translational-DOF Spatial Compliant Mechanism	The mainly feature of topological structure is hingeless (or hidden hinges), so it is important to find an exactly pseudo-rigid-body model (PRBM) for the spatial compliant mechanism with a topological structure. Considering the Jacobain matrix maps the velocity of the joint space of the robot to the end velocity of the Cartesian space, a novel topology optimization approach is proposed in this paper for the design of three Translational degree-of-freedom (DOF) spatial compliant mechanisms by combination the optimized Jacobain mapping matrix with the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) topological method. Firstly, by using the condition number method, the structural parameters of UPU type parallel prototype manipulator are optimized, and then, the differential Jacobain mapping matrix is calculated by using differential infinitesimal equivalence method with micro/nano scale motion characteristics. Secondly, comparing with the diver configuration and twist/wrench constraint conditions of the UPU type parallel prototype manipulator, the topological algorithm combined SIMP with optimized Jacobian mapping matrix is proposed. Finally, a novel spatial compliant mechanism with three translational DOF is derived, and a numerical simulation results are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
1031	Electron beam-based metrology after CMOS	We review post-CMOS challenges facing electron-based metrology, using directed self-assembly, nanophotonics/plasmonics, and memristive switches as exemplars of post-CMOS technologies. Novel materials, devices, and architectures pose new metrology requirements: defect detection, in soft materials, accurate measurement of size, shape, and roughness of nanophotonic structures, contamination-free measurement of surface-sensitive structures, and identification of subtle structural, chemical, or electronic changes of state in non-volatile memory-element switching. Electron-beam techniques are examined in light of these requirements. Strong electron-matter interactions provide measurable signals from small samples, rendering electron-beam methods suitable for nanometer-scale metrology, but many measurement challenges remain. The seeds of possible solutions are identified.
1032	<strong>Fracture toughnesses and crack growth angles of three types of carbon allotropes</strong>	Recently, Shang et al. [Angew. Chem. Inte. Ed., 2018, 57(3):774-778] have developed a method to synthesize ultrathin (around 1.9 nm) graphyne nanosheets. We reported here the mixed-mode I-II fracture toughnesses and crack growth angles of cyclicgraphene and graphyne as well as supergraphene using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and finite element (FE) method based on the boundary layer model, respectively. The various carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds of the three carbon allotropes in the FE method is equivalent into a nonlinear Timoshenko beam based on the Tersoff-Brenner potential, where all the parameters of the nonlinear beams are completely determined based on the continuum modeling. All results from the present FE method are reasonable by comparison with those from our MD simulations using REBO potential. The present results show that both critical stress intensity factors (SIFs) and crack growth angles strongly depend on their chirality and loading angle <em>&phi;</em> (<em>&phi;=</em>90&ordm; and <em>&phi;=</em>0&ordm; represent the pure mode I and the pure mode II, respectively). The critical equivalent SIFs are derived as 1.55 &lt;<em>K</em><sub>eq-cy</sub> (cyclic) &lt;1.95 nN &Aring;<sup>-3/2</sup>, 1.64 &lt;<em>K</em><sub>eq-gy</sub> (graphyne) &lt; 2.64 nN &Aring;<sup>-3/2</sup> and 0.61 &lt;<em>K</em><sub>eq-su</sub> (super) &lt; 2.04 nN &Aring;<sup>-3/2</sup> in corresponding zigzag and armchair sheets using MD simulations, while the SIFs are 0.32 &lt;<em>K</em><sub>eq-cy</sub> (cyclic) &lt;0.48 nN &Aring;<sup>-3/2</sup>, 1.96 &lt;<em>K</em><sub>eq-gy</sub> (graphyne) &lt; 2.49 nN &Aring;<sup>-3/2</sup> and 1.42 &lt;<em>K</em><sub>eq-su</sub> (super) &lt; 2.95 nN &Aring;<sup>-3/2 </sup>using FE method. These findings should be great help for understanding fracture properties of carbon allotropes and designing the carbon-based nanodevices.
1033	Yagi-Uda Nanoantenna Enhanced Metal-Semiconductor-Metal Photodetector<strong></strong>	An array of 400 nanolithographic Yagi-Uda antennas on a metal-semiconductor-metal rectifier photodetector demonstrates control of wavelength selectivity and directivity.  The nanoantenna array response is obtained using a direct electrical measurement approach.  Resonances in rectified photocurrent are detected at incident electromagnetic radiation of free-space wavelengths 1110 nm and 1690 nm, corresponding to scaled effective wavelengths of 388 nm and 776 nm respectively.  The scaling is consistent with theory based on plasmonic effects in nanoscale devices at optical frequencies, and the two resonance wavelengths are found to match respectively full-wavelength and half-wavelength operation of the detector dipole element.
1034	Generation of UV-induced radiation defects in calcite	The effect of UV light on the most common mineral on Earth - calcite (CaCO3), has been little investigated, despite its significant implications for many areas of research, such as photodegradation of CaCO3-containing materials, conservation of historical objects, dosimetry and dating. In this study, conducted on nano- and micro-grained calcite samples using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy, we provide a detailed analysis of the radiation defects (paramagnetic centers) generated by UV radiation, including their identification, location (surface- or bulk-related) and stability during the period up to 4 years after irradiation. The observed paramagnetic centers, such as isotropic and anisotropic CO2-, CO3-, SO2-, SO3-, NO32- and NO22- ions, are analogous to gamma-induced species, which contradicts a widely-held belief that low-energy radiation cannot create radiation defects in wide band-gap materials, such as calcite. We present a mechanism of UV-induced generation of carbonate paramagnetic species in calcite based on retrapping the 'secondary electrons', i.e. the electrons released from non-carbonate traps by UV light. The efficiency of this process is strongly connected with the size and morphology of calcite grains, which can be especially relevant, considering the variety of CaCO3 particles used in the industry and available in nature.
1035	Edge mode based graphene nanomechanical resonators for high-sensitivity mass sensor	We perform both molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical analysis to study the sensitivity of the mass sensor based on graphene nanomechanical resonators, which are actuated following the global extended mode or the localized edge mode. We find that the mass detection sensitivity corresponding to the edge mode is about three times higher than that corresponding to the extended mode. Our analytic derivations reveal that the enhancement of the sensitivity originates in the reduction of the effective mass for the edge mode due to its localizing feature. Our findings shed light on improving the sensitivity of the graphene based mass spectrometry by utilizing the localized edge mode.
1036	Electron hole plasma dynamics in pristine and Ag-doped ZnO nanorods	Femtosecond two color pump-probe transmission experiments are carried out at large carrier densities, much higher than the Mott density on pristine and Ag doped ZnO nanorod ensembles. The data shows tri-exponential decay: ultrafast electron-phonon thermalization (~ 0.40 ps), trap mediated decay with time constant (~ 9 ps), and electron-hole recombination with time constant (~ 650 ps). As the carrier density is increased, the first two decay processes get longer on contrary to the recombination time which gets shorter. Carrier density dependent studies coupled with detailed two temperature model suggest interplay of complex variation of electron-phonon interaction and trap states.
1037	<strong>Theoretical analysis and optimization of high k dielectric layers for designing high performance and low power dissipated nanoscale double gate MOSFETs</strong>	The carrier transport and tunnelling mechanism in nanoscale double gate (DG) metal oxide field effect transistor (MOSFET) for different dielectric layers is investigated here by a simple two dimensional analytical model, which finds good agreement with the drift diffusion and hydrodynamic models at lower gate voltages. The model is utilized to optimize the performance of the MOSFET by minimizing the carrier leakage and improving the gate control on the carrier transport through the channel. It is well known that thicker physical layers of high k dielectrics can be used to reduce gate tunnelling current without compromising on the gate controllability over the channel conduction as it provides the same equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) as SiO<sub>2</sub>. However, lower conduction band offset of the dielectric layer over Si MOSFET can cause appreciable tunnelling through the gate as found through our computational results for the TiO<sub>2</sub> layer. Our findings suggest a combination of dielectric layers; one having higher dielectric constant and the other having larger conduction band offset over Si, to minimize gate leakage. Tunnelling current is analysed for different combinational dielectric layers along with optimization of its thickness. Our study predicts minimum current leakage for the MOSFET with 4&Aring; La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/ 9&Aring; TiO<sub>2</sub> combinational dielectric layer having the drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL) factor of 29 mV/V, &lsquo;off&rsquo; state power dissipation of 2.3 nW and a high I<sub>on</sub>/I<sub>off</sub> ratio of 1.6&times;10<sup>7</sup>. The study thus predicts the suitability of this MOSFET for low power devices and logic circuits.
1038	<strong>Comparative Study on Exothermic Behavior of Nano Composites (Al/CuO, Mg/CuO and Al/Mg/CuO)</strong>	Comparative experimental study on exothermicity of nano energetic composites has been conducted in this study. Three different composites consisting of CuO and each one of the following: Al, Mg and Al/Mg were prepared using physical mixing. The composites prepared consist of 100% excess oxidant to provide more oxygen for oxidation process. The particles were not passivated with any coating to study their unique parameters. Differential Scanning Calorimeter, Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis and Differential Thermal Analysis have been carried out on all three composites to compare them. Scanning Electron Microscope was used for imaging the composite&rsquo;s homogeneity. The main objective of the study is to improve heat generation and lower the ignition temperatures of the composite by formulating the composite with two different metal fuels. The composite made of both Al and Mg in CuO showed high reactivity, low ignition temperature and high heat generation than the composites prepared of individual metal fuels. These results of heat generation and weight loss help in fundamental understanding of chemical reactions undergoing in the composites. This study might help in further advancements in the field of energetic materials.
1039	<strong>Ultrastable water suspension of luminescent carbon quantum dots</strong>	Crystalline graphite microparticles are good source for fabricating graphene or carbon quantum dots. The low toxicity, chemical stability and fluorescence properties make these quantum materials suitable for applications in biomedical and water purification technologies. In this paper, we show that by nanosecond laser irradiation of graphitic microparticles in water, a highly stable water suspension of carbon quantum dots of high purity and strongly luminescent in the green is generated. The size of the quantum dots can be tuned in the range of 5 nm to 15 nm by varying the laser irradiation time. During the laser interaction, the ionization of the material and the surrounding water layer creates functional groups &ndash;HC=O, C&ndash;O&ndash;C and C&ndash;O attached to the surface of the quantum dots. Further, the presence of similar charges on the surface of the quantum dots developed during the laser ablation process helps in obtaining a highly stable water suspension of the quantum dots.
1040	Distribution of label spacings for genome mapping in nanochannels	In genome mapping experiments, long DNA molecules are stretched by confining them to very narrow channels, so that the locations of sequence-specific fluorescent labels along the channel axis provide large-scale genomic information.  It is difficult, however, to make the channels narrow enough so that the DNA molecule is fully stretched. In practice its conformations may form hairpins that change the spacings between internal segments of the DNA molecule, and thus the label locations along the channel axis. Here we describe a theory for the distribution of label spacings that explains the heavy tails observed in distributions of label spacings in genome mapping experiments.
1041	Lipids with bulky head groups generate large membrane curvatures by small compositional asymmetries	Glycolipids such as GM1 have bulky head groups consisting sof several monosaccharides. sWhen these lipids are added to phospholipid bilayers, they sgenerate large  membrane curvatures even for small compositional sasymmetries between the two leaflets of the bilayers. sOn the micrometer scale,  these bilayer asymmetries lead to the sspontaneous  tubulation of giant vesicles as recently observed sby optical microscopy.  sHere, we study these mixed membranes on the nanometer sscale using coarse-grained molecular simulations. sThe membrane composition  is defined by  the mole fractions s$\phi_1$ and  $\phi_2$  of the large-head lipid in the two leaflets sof the bilayer.  sSymmetric membranes are obtained for  $\phi_1 = \phi_2 \equiv \phi_\rle $, sasymmetric ones for $\phi_1 \ne \phi_2$.  sIn both cases, we compute the density and stress profiles sacross the membranes. sThe stress profiles are used to identify the tensionless states sof the membranes. sSymmetric and tensionless bilayers are found to be stable  within sthe whole composition range $0 \leq \phi_\rle \leq 1$. s For these symmetric bilayers,  both the area compressibility s modulus and the bending rigidity are found to  vary non-monotonically s with the leaflet mole fraction $\phi_\rle$.  s For asymmetric bilayers, we compute the product  of bending s rigidity and spontaneous curvature from the first moment of the stress s profile and determine  the bending rigidities of the  asymmetric s membranes using the $\phi_\rle$-dependent rigidities of the single leaflets. s When we combine these   results,  the compositional asymmetry s $\phi_1 - \phi_2$  is found to generate the spontaneous curvature s $(\phi_1- \phi_2)/ ( 0.63 \,  \ell_\rme)$ s with  the membrane thickness $\ell_\rme \simeq 4\,$nm. s Therefore,  the spontaneous curvature increases linearly with s the compositional asymmetry. Furthermore,   s  the  small compositional asymmetry $\phi_1 - \phi_2 = 0.04$s leads to the large spontaneous curvature $1/(63\,$nm) and the  s increased asymmetry $\phi_1 - \phi_2 = 0.2$  generates the huge s spontaneous curvature $1/(13\,$nm). sThese large values  of the spontaneous curvature will facilitate future simulation studies of various membrane processes such sas bud formation and  nanoparticle  engulfment.
1042	<strong>Absorption enhancement in an amorphous silicon using a cluster of plasmonic  hollow ring nano-antennas </strong>	Enhancement of absorption and extending its bandwidth is of major interest for solar cells, photo detectors, and variety of applications. This letter presents a nano-structure formed of an array whose elements are in the form of a 3X3 cluster of metal rings having similar outer diameter but with various inner diameters. Thus each ring size produces certain resonance frequency and the result of the cluster arrangement is a staggered responses that possess larger bandwidth. Simulations using the periodic unit cell approach and the CST microwave studio suite showed that the average absorption power in an amorphous silicon layer has been improved by 3.32 times compared to that without rings. The obtained response covers the frequency range from 230 THz to 360 THz.
1043	Study of signal enhancement in collinear femtosecond-nanosecond double-pulse laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy	The study of spectral emission intensity in a femtosecond-nanosecond double-pulse laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy with collinear configuration (fs-ns DP-LIBS collinear configuration) was presented. The experiment was carried out in air at atmospheric pressure using Si sample irradiated by a femtosecond laser beam and a nanosecond laser beam. In order to explore the advantages of this configuration (fs-ns DP-LIBS collinear configuration), the experiments of femtosecond SP-LIBS and nanosecond SP-LIBS were also performed for the same Si sample. The experimental data indicated that the shorter laser pulse (femtosecond) was efficient in coupling to the sample and the longer laser pulse (nanosecond) is suitable for re-heating the produced plasma. In the meantime, the used fs-ns DP-LIBS collinear configuration can be considered as an efficient technique for enhancing the spectral intensity during the ablation processes.
1044	Coercive field enhancement in Co nanodisks: Single-domain to vortex switching	We report in plane magnetic measurements of Ti/Co/Nb nanodisks with the Co layer fabricated in the range of thicknesses between 6 to 14 nm. Additionally micromagnetic simulations were carried out with OOMMF giving magnetic domain structure and hysteresis loops which were later compared with those obtained experimentally using vibrating sample magnetometry. Simulation and experiment indicate a peak in coercive field at a critical thickness that clearly separates the two phases; single domain and vortex phase. This peak is characterized by a substantially larger coercive field opening the possibility to investigate such enhancement in other ferromagnetic materials.
1045	<strong>Nanoplasmonic-whispering gallery mode hybrid microresonator for enhancing single molecule Raman scattering and fluorescence</strong>	For the first time, we propose the enhancement of Raman scattering signal using a nanoplasmonic-whispering gallery mode (WGM) hybrid microresonator (HMR). Using the reactive sensing principle, analytical theory is developed for estimating the enhancement of single molecule Raman signal (<em>&eta;</em>) by an HMR relative to the conventional surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technique. Theoretical simulations have been carried out using developed theory to understand the dependence of <em>&eta;</em> on quality factor of WGM, input light power, wavelength of incident light. It is observed that the HMR is better for obtaining more enhancement as long as efficient evanescent coupling exists for proper launching of laser light into the HMR. Hence, this hybrid device can be used for studying single molecule Raman scattering and for the same purpose, an experimental setup has been proposed. This device is also found better in enhancing single molecule fluorescence as compared with the conventional surface enhanced fluorescence (SEF) technique. Finally, suitable nanoplasmonic structures are proposed for making efficient hybrid microresonators (HMRs) for studying single molecule Raman scattering/fluorescence and their local field strengths are estimated using finite element method (FEM).
1046	Plasmonics effects arising from the rotational metal/dielectric nanostructures	We have investigated the plasmonic effects on a two-dimensional periodic array of composite metal/dielectric nanostructures which the integration of the localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and hollow plasmon resonance (HPR) properties is performed. The unit cell of the array is composed of the combination the silver core-shell nanorod and dielectric nanosphere in a single structure. We make use of the finite element method to obtain the simulation results which demonstrate that the localized SPR and HPR originating from the rotational metal/dielectric nanostructures enhance the near field intensity and transmittance dip, which provides additional degrees of freedom in the control of light wave at the nanoscale. Numerical results show that the depth of transmittance dip and sensitivity can be elevated to a value of 73.91% and 2.5 times, respectively, when the rotational angle of metal/dielectric nanostructures varies from 00 to 900, and the characteristics can be extensive applications for nanophotonic devices.
1047	Shape-dependent magnetoelectric coupling in nanoscale BiFeO$_3$	The nanorods and nanocuboids of multiferroic BiFeO$_3$ exhibit remarkable shape dependence of crystallographic, ferroelectric, and magnetoelectric properties. The nanorods, for example, assume R3m space group (as against R3c observed both in bulk and nearly spherical nanosized particles) and are found to be oriented preferentially with long axis $\parallel$ [101]. The magnetic and electric coercive fields as well as magnetoelectric coupling - measured from change in remanent polarization under a magnetic field - are found to be larger in nanocuboids. The shape dependence of multiferroic properties originates from that of microstrain and anisotropy.
1048	<strong>Structural and optical study of Zn-doped As<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> thin films: Evidence for photoinduced formation of ZnSe nanocrystallites</strong>	Amorphous Zn-doped As<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> films with a nominal zinc content <em>x</em> up to 10 at.% were prepared by thermal evaporation. Their structure is characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectroscopy. The AFM data show a considerable increase of the film surface roughness for films with <em>x</em> &gt; 5 at.%. A strong gradient of the Zn content decreasing into the film depth is confirmed by the EDX and XPS data. Heavily Zn-doped (above 7 at.%) As<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> films reveal photostructural changes in the course of the Raman measurements. New Raman features are attributed to TO and LO vibrations of ZnSe nanocrystallites formed in the film under laser illumination. Depending on the laser wavelength and power density, the ZnSe nanocrystallites can experience tensile strain in the film due to a photoplastic effect in the As<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> film (partial removal of the material from the laser spot). The tensile strain value, estimated from the TO and LO phonon frequency shift, is shown to reach up to 2.9 GPa.
1049	Negative differential resistance in twisted graphene nanoribbons	In this work, we analyze the electron transmission through twisted graphene nanoribbons with armchair or zigzag edges connected to leads and subjected to an external electric field. The combination of both electric field and helical conformation of the nanoribbon induces a periodic potential for electrons transmitting from the source to the drain. The periodic potential results in allowed bands and gaps that lead to negative differential resistance and the N-shaped current-voltage characteristics in the case of zig-zag nanoribbons. In addition, the electric field can efficiently control the current flowing through the nanoribbon. This opens the possibility to use the proposed device as a field-effect transistor or active element in amplifiers or generators.
1050	Two-dimensional Au-1,3,5 triethynylbenzene organometallic lattice: Structure, half-metallicity and gas sensing	On the basis of first-principles calculations, we investigated the structural and electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) Au-1,3,5 triethynylbenzene (Au-TEB) framework, which has been recently synthesized by homocoupling reactions in experiments. Featured by C-Au-C linkage, 2D Au-TEB network has a kagome lattice by Au atom and a hexagonal lattice by organic molecule within the same metal-organic framework (MOF), which exhibits intrinsic half-metallicity with one spin channel metallic and the other spin channel fully insulating with a large energy gap of 2.8 eV. Two branches of kagome bands are located near Fermi level, with each branch including one flat band and two Dirac bands, which originates from the out-of-plane dxz and dyz orbitals of Au and may lead to many exotic topological quantum phases. We further studied the adsorption of F, Cl atoms, and small gas molecules including O2, CO, NO2 and NH3 on Au-TEB network, aiming to exploit its potential applications in gas sensors. Detailed analyses on adsorption geometry, energy, molecular orbital interaction and electronic structure modification suggest the great potential of Au-TEP as a promising alternative for gas sensing. We expect these results to expand the universe of low-dimensional half-metallic MOF structures and shed new light on their practical applications in nanoelectronics/spintronics.
1051	<strong>Low-voltage dielectric elastomer actuators </strong><strong>with stretchable electrodes fabricated by supersonic cluster beam implantation</strong>	Supersonic Cluster Beam Implantation (SCBI) of Ag nanoparticles is proposed for the fabrication of stretchable and compliant electrodes for Dielectric Elastomer Actuators (DEAs) with reduced thickness. Thanks to the low-energy and finely tunable implantation process, a nanocomposite Ag/PDMS electrode layer is produced with moderate stiffening effect for the DEA in contrast with common deposition strategy for electrodes. Thin DEAs with overall thickness of 17 mm were fabricated and tested under different preloading conditions, demonstrating a max uniaxial actuation strain of 2.5% at an actuation voltage of 765 V, lower than typical voltage values of DEAs. The electrodes remained conductive up to 40% strain and they fully recovered original resistance after 70% stretching. Our results represent a significant step towards the development of DEAs operating at reduced actuation voltages, by stacking of micrometer-thick elastomer films, paving the way to novel applications in soft robotics.
1052	Remote control of liquid crystal elastomer random laser using external stimuli	We present a new design for a random laser based on a composite material consisting in an elastomeric liquid crystal with embedded TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles. Random lasing action can be controlled by an external, non-contact light stimulus; this induces a rearrangement of the elastomeric liquid crystals that moves the laser body in and out of the focal plane of a pump laser, pushing its emission above or below the lasing threshold.
1053	Enhancing the figure-of-merit of refractive index sensors by magnetoplasmons in one-dimensional nanograting	The sensing performance of one-dimensional metallic-magnetic grating based on magnetoplasmons was investigated. The predictable Kerr reversal and enhancement are achieved in our experiment. The further result shows that the shift of Kerr null point has a linear relationship with the surrounding refractive index in a wide range. Thus a huge figure of merit (FoM) of 1728  is achieved, which is 1 order of magnitude higher than the results reported. The experiment and theory confirm that the excitation of surface plasmons leads to the Kerr reversal and enhancement, resulting in a huge FoM.
1054	<strong>Effect of NiSb nanoparticle coating on the thermoelectric properties of bulk Antimonide-Telluride particles </strong>	NiSb nanoparticles by 0.034, 0.074 and 0.16 volume fractions were successfully coated on bulk Ni<sub>0.05</sub>Mo<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>5.4</sub>Te<sub>1.6</sub> thermoelectric (TE) particles through solvothermal route without deteriorating the bulk Ni<sub>0.05</sub>Mo<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>5.4</sub>Te<sub>1.6 </sub>material. For samples of 0.074 NiSb and 0.16 NiSb, layers of 100-300 nm NiSb nanoparticles were observed. The samples were consolidated through hot pressing and their thermoelectric(TE) properties were characterized. At 400 K, 500 K, and 600 K, 0.074 NiSb sample exhibited a 22%, 16% and 11.3% increase in power factor (<em>P.F.</em>) compared to bulk. The main contributing factor to this enhanced power factor is the elevated electrical conductivity. For the same sample, the reciprocal relationship between Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity is decoupled. Sample 0.16 NiSb exhibited the highest electrical conductivity among the three samples. The thermal conductivity of the 0.16 sample is less temperature sensitive compared to other samples. HRTEM and SEM tools were applied to comprehend microstructural features and their relation to TE transport properties. Pore effect on the thermal and electrical conductivity was elucidated. This study shows that grain- boundary manipulation via this wet chemistry technique is indeed economically viable method to fabricate and optimize the transport properties of bulk TE materials.
1055	<strong>Fabrication and investigation of a thermoacoustic loudspeaker based on carbon nanotube coated laser scribed graphene</strong>	Thermophones are known since a century ago, however, high operational voltage and low sound pressure level are the main drawbacks which have constrained their wide application.Utilizing graphene in thermophones has been proposed as an attractive solution, due to its high electrical and thermal conductivity and inherent high surface area. These unique properties are beneficial to enhance the heat transfer, and lowering the required electrical input power. In this paper, laser scribed graphene layer is utilized to realize graphene-based thermophones, which has shown high sound pressure level of about80 dB (P<sub>in</sub>=0.6 W). Furthermore, a layer of carbon nanotubes isincorporated on theprepared graphene sheets. The realized CNT based layerbenefits from bothrandomly oriented CNTs over the surface of rGO sheets, andsuspended CNTs, which act like heat exchangernano-fins on rGO sheets, and efficient heat generators, respectively. The input voltagefor CNT/rGO based thermophones is measured 7 times lower than the prepared rGO based samples, in order to generate the same sound pressure level (75 dB). The achieved sound pressure, normalized to the input power, has increased about 80 dB by incorporating CNTs, which entitles the proposed structure as a promising candidate for novel thermophones.
1056	Side Chain Dynamics in Semi-Conducting Polymer MEH-PPV	The characteristic nanoscale dynamics of the alkyl side groups in the light-emitting polymer MEH-PPV or poly[2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] have been investigated using quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS). The measurements were taken at temperatures below the polymer glass transition (T {less than or equal to} Tg &#x2243; 353 K), where the main backbone is in a rigid state and does not contribute to the broadening of the QENS signal. An analytical diffusion model consisting of a static term and two dynamical components, characterizing the flexible side groups, provide an excellent fit to the experimental data. The two observed dynamical processes are all localized in character, with no meaningful dependence on temperature. The faster process, with characteristic time scale of &#x223C; 18 ps at room temperature (RT), can be linked to the average mobility of the protons at the terminal end of the alkyl chain, while the slower process, with characteristic time scale of &#x223C; 170 ps at RT, to those protons at the other end of the alkyl chain, closest to the backbone. While the fraction of mobile protons contributing to the QENS signal increases with increasing temperature, the characteristic time scale and confining volume within which the protons are able to move locally depend chiefly on the polymer conformational state.
1057	Solid State Streak Camera Prototype Electronic Performance Testing and Improvements to Dynamic Range	Streak Cameras are an essential diagnostic tool used in shock physics and high energy density physics experiments.  Such experiments require well calibrated temporally resolving diagnostics for studying events that occur on the nanosecond to microsecond time scales.  The Nevada National Security Site (NNSS) and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) has built a 42-channel solid state streak camera (SSSC) prototype as a proof of concept for use as a streak camera replacement.  This work is part of an ongoing project to develop the technology to a level competitive with analog streak cameras.  The device concept, results from electronic testing and recent improvements to increase the device's dynamic range will be discussed in this manuscript.
1058	Simulation and Verification of the Dielectric Strength in Polyethylene-Montmorillonite Nanocomposites	In order to explore the microscopic mechanism of mechanical properties and dielectric strength in polyethylene-montmorillonite (PE-MMT) nanocomposites, the molecular model and molecule&rsquo;s structure are simulated by simulation software, and the mechanism of various complex phenomena of mechanical properties and dielectric strength in PE-MMT nanocomposites can be understood more profoundly in the paper. Some important findings emerge from the simulation results. First of all, interlayer spacing of organic modified MMT is expanded to 20&Aring; due to octadecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride cation, which is increased by 79% compared with that of MMT without organic. Meantime, the expansibility of nanocomposites is obvious compared with that of organic modified MMT. Second, when the mass fraction of organic modified MMT reaches 4.0wt%, the hydrogen bonding interaction obviously exists in PE-MMT nanocomposites and the interaction energy between polyethylene molecules and MMT layers has the maximum that is up to -444.46kcal/mol, which lead to the stable structure of nanocomposites and the significant improvement of the interaction between MMT and PE. Third, mechanical properties and dielectric strength are significantly improved in nanocomposites under elastic deformation. Young's modulus, bulk modulus and shear modulus are increased by 106%, 116% and 105% respectively, and the dielectric strength is increased by 43%. Finally, it is found that the experimental dielectric strength of 4.0wt% organic modified MMT in nanocomposites is increased by 13.64% compared with that of polyethylene. Furthermore, the simulation results are consistent with the experimental ones, which can prove that the method of modeling of PE-MMT nanocomposites is correct and effective.
1059	From C60 'trilliumons' to 'trilliumenes': self-assembly of 2D fullerene nanostructures on metal-covered silicon and germanium	We discovered a set of C60 nanostructures that appear to be constructed using a universal building block made of four C60 molecules on Si(111) or Ge(111) surfaces covered by an atomic layer of Tl, Pb, or their compound. The building block is a four-C60 cluster having a shape reminiscent of the three-petal flower 'white trillium'. Therefore, we call it 'trilliumon' and the various 2D ordered nanostructures derived from it 'trilliumenes'. Self-assembly of the trilliumenes is a result of an intricate interplay among the adsorbed C60 molecules, metal atoms, and semiconductor substrate. Remarkably, that all metal layers triggering formation of trilliumenes on Si(111) surface have recently been reported to be the thinnest 2D superconductors. In this respect, the trilliumenes show promise to be 2D nanostructured superconductors which properties are awaiting their exploration.
1060	GaN nanowire surface recombination by light-induced ion trapping	Nanowires intrinsically exhibit a large surface area, which makes them sensitive to physical and chemical interactions with their environment. Here, we investigate the surface recombination at m-plane side walls of selective area-grown GaN nanowires on Si (111) subjected to different environmental conditions. In contrast to the stable photoluminescence observed from c-plane surfaces of films, nanowires exhibit a distinct time-dependent photoluminescence quenching by over 90% within the time scale of seconds in the presence of air or dissociated liquids. This quenching is most pronounced for 50 nm diameter nanowires with interwire spacings larger than 500 nm due to internal electric field and external light field distributions. Ion- and pH-sensitive measurements, in combination with an externally applied voltage allows the assignment of this effect to anions from the surroundings accumulate at the nonpolar GaN side walls of the UV-exposed GaN nanowires. The decay times of the luminescence signal follow the dynamics of valence band holes, which deplete GaN surface states and positively charge the nanowire surfaces. This, in turn, induces the buildup of a capacitive anion shell around the nanowires, leading to an enhanced nonradiative surface recombination of photo-generated charge carriers from the GaN nanowire. In the absence of UV light, a recovery of the photoluminescence signal within tens of minutes indicates the dissolution of the anionic shell via charge balancing. The impact of light-induced electronic and ionic charge redistribution on photocarrier recombination represents and important mechanism of function for GaN nanowire-based devices, ranging from sensors to photocatalysts.
1061	The ice-like vortex states in a nanostructured superconducting film with a dice lattice of elongated antidots	We study the degeneracy of the superconducting vortex ground state in a dice lattice of elongated antidots within the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. It is found there are two kinds of unit cells in this dice lattice, namely $z6$ unit cell where six antibars meet and $z3$ unit cell where three antibars meet. This can result in more complicated vortex arrangements in the unit cells than that in the Kagome lattice. We demonstrate that the vortex patterns at specific fractional magnetic fields can be determined by the local constraints, which presented the ice-like configuration based on the degeneracy rules. This is the reason that the vortex system follows the rule of "two vortices in, one vortex out" or "two vortices out, one vortex in" at each vertex of $z3$ unit cell. The so-called degeneracy rules are explored by considering nearest-neighbor interaction. Thus, it is possible to realize a rich variety of ice-like vortex configurations in a large area of the sample. Moreover, there is little difference of the free energy and critical current density for the degenerate vortex states, which implies the existence of the degeneracy in the dice lattice.
1062	Scalable integration of periodically aligned 2D-MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoribbon array	Despite a recent growing interest in 2D-MoS<sub>2</sub> nanostructures for versatile platforms of sensor applications, robust and practical 2D-MoS<sub>2</sub> nanostructures have rarely been reported to date due to the absence of a facile, scalable and repeatable nanofabrication method.  Herein, we show the fabrication of periodically aligned 2D-MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoribbons (MNR) array with an area of 2.25 cm<sup>2</sup> via direct metal transfer (DMT). The MNR width is scalable from 463 nm to 135 nm at 650 nm pitch, and the smallest width is approximately 80 nm. The robust and stable material characteristics are confirmed via various spectroscopic analyses and application sensor devices.
1063	<strong>Self-induced birefringence of white-light continuum generated by interaction of focused femtosecond laser pulses with fused silica</strong>	White-light continuum can be induced by intense ultrashort laser pulses interaction with condensed materials. A self-induced birefringence of continuum was observed when focusing amplified femtosecond laser pulses into fused silica, an isotropic material in ordinary optical field. The self-induced birefringence of continuum shows a growth and saturation feature with the time evolution. The dependence of self-induced birefringence of continuum on the laser energy and the sample thickness was also investigated. A mechanism based on the formation of anisotropic nanostructures which modulate the transmission of the generated continuum explains well the experimental observation.
1064	Nanorods Structure Dependent Low Temperature and Low Concentration Hydrogen Sensing a Platform for Self Powered Sensing	The today&rsquo;s economy augmentation depends on fossil fuels. But fossil fuel is going to end in near future. Hydrogen can replace fossil fuels. Use of hydrogen as the fuel is risky because it is highly inflammable gas. For safe use of hydrogen, its detection up to few (1-10ppm) ppm and at low temperature (room temperature) is crucial. Last decades have seen tremendous advancement in sensor technology, but even today we have not a single sensor which can detect hydrogen with low ppm and at room temperature. In this work, we were able to develop a dislocated ZnO nanorods based sensor which was detected the hydrogen at 4ppm. This low concentration of hydrogen was detected at room temperature. The most interesting the nanorods was not decorated with any catalyst material like Pt, Pd, and Au.
1065	Tunable Anderson localization of propagating graphene surface plasmonmodes in a random modulated graphene monolayer	Graphene is a two-dimensional material that has attracted a lot of attention due to the excitation of surface<br />plasmons in the mid-infrared region. In this letter, we present the emergence of Anderson localization of propagating surface plasmon in a monolayer of graphene imbedded on a silicon Bragg-grating nanostructure. <br />In this proposed plasmonic structure a silica medium lays between the silicon substrate grating and a mono-layer of graphene. Introducing moderate randomness to the period of the grating leads to the trapping of the propagating surface plasmons in di&#xFB00;erent e&#xFB00;ective local cavities along the graphene sheet. Also, several new localized graphene surface plasmon (GSP) modes appear inside and outside the stopband of the propagating surface plasmons in a periodic substrate structure. The &#xFB01;eld intensity distribution and the quality factor of localized GSPs modes show an enhancement by a factor of 9 and 7 respectively respect to the corresponding intensity and quality factor in the periodic structure. Although controlling and tuning the values of the resonance wavelengths belonging to Anderson localized GSPs is a di&#xFB03;cult task due to its random nature, here we tune these wavelengths by using an external gate voltage to adjust the Fermi energy of the monolayer graphene.
1066	<strong>Controllable doping of graphene quantum dots by chlorine for </strong><strong>ultrahigh performance of photodetector</strong>	Graphene had attracted tremendous attention in a wide range of scientific fields. However, the absence of band-gap in the intrinsic graphene structure makes it unsuitable for optoelectronic applications. Thus opening and tailoring of a band gap in graphene for specific application is an important mission. Doping provides an effective pathway to open the band gap of graphene for electronic devices. Up to now, very few investigations on the band modulation of GQDs and their photovoltaic detectors have been reported. Herein, we report that chlorine-doped graphene quantum dots (Cl-GQDs) with the typical diameter of 3.3 nm have been prepared by a facile co-combustion method (T-X-J method) which can easily tune the doping concentration. Meanwhile, a nanocomposite of Cl-GQDs and ZnO QDs has been achieved by chemical route which was then used as the photo-active material. The photodetectors based on ZnO QDs/Cl-GQDs nanocomposite shows an excellent performance for light response from 365 to 650 nm, showing the important application value in optoelectronics.
1067	Time-Resolved and Multiple-Angle Thomson Scattering on Gas Puff Z-Pinch Plasmas	A 526.5 nm, Thomson scattering diagnostic laser enables probing of the plasma conditions of neon gas-puff z-pinch implosions with temporal resolution. Splitting the laser into two 2.5 J pulses, both 2.3 ns in duration and separated by 4 ns, allows observation of sub-nanosecond time-resolved spectra for a total  time of 7 ns. Collection optics are set at 90 degrees and 30 degrees to the laser, observing the same on-axis scattering volume with a radial extent of 0.4 mm. The spectra from both angles were collected by the same streak camera, using a coupling system that allows us to obtain temporal, spectral, and angular resolution in the same image. By comparing the spectra from the two angles, we determined electron temperature and a range of possible electron densities from the ion acoustic feature. Measurements made in the 1-3 ns period before pinch time show best fit (determined by a least-squares method) electron densities of around 2x10^19 cm^-3, increasing to 1.5x10^20 cm^-3 in the 3 ns following the start of the x-ray burst (t=0 ns) from the pinch. The electron temperature increases from 300 eV to 500 eV at t=0 ns before decreasing to below 300 eV after pinch time. With the present parameters (probe beam, collection angles, and electron temperature and density) this technique of electron density measurement proves to be too insensitive to provide precision.
1068	A design method for nanofluidic circuits	A design method was proposed for nanofluidic circuits, based on the flow equation for a nanoscale fluid flow. This method incorporates the use of the concepts of the flow resistance, the flow rate, the pressure drop and the power loss, as like in electric circuits. The equations for calculating the flow resistance and the power loss in exemplary nanofluidic circuits including in a nanotube tree are presented. It was found that the nanotube size and the fluid-tube wall interaction both have great influences on the flow resistance and the power loss in nanochannel flow. Exemplary design analysis was given for some nanofluidic circuits, based on the proposed method.
1069	Illumination impact on monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> chemical sensor arrays	Molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) is a promising nanomaterial for chemical sensing due to its exceptional properties.  However, it is extremely sensitive to illumination and converts the energy of photons absorbed into photocurrent, which has hampered efforts to explore the sensing performance and underlying transduction mechanism of intrinsic MoS<sub>2</sub>.  Here we systematically explored the sensing behavior of intrinsic MoS<sub>2</sub> and the impact of illumination.  Without illumination, MoS<sub>2</sub> demonstrated record-high sensitivity reaching 1030 for pH change by 1 unit.  Its photoresponsivity (1300 A/W) can be tuned by ions in electrolyte.  Photon absorption not only substantially reduced the response of intrinsic MoS<sub>2</sub> by up to 95%, but also changed its sensing mechanism.  After revealing the remarkable sensing performance of intrinsic MoS<sub>2</sub>, we demonstrated the possibility of the integration of MoS<sub>2</sub> sensors functionalized with ionophore.  Multiplex trace detection of Na<sup>+</sup>, Hg<sup>2+</sup>, and Cd<sup>2+</sup> was realized on a 1 cm&times;1 cm chip with tunable sensitivity by illumination.  The ion sensing results demonstrated outstanding selectivity, detection limit (10 &mu;M), and response rate (10 s).  Our results show the prominent advantages of intrinsic MoS<sub>2</sub> as a chemical sensing material.
1070	Localized surface plasmon resonance property of bi-layer split ring-rods nanostructure	Metal nanostructures have been broadly applied in surface enhancement fluorescence, circular dichroism, filtering and many other aspects due to their unique optical properties. In this paper, a Bi-layer split ring-rods nanostructure is designed and the different responses of the nanostructure to the left-handed circularly polarized light and right-handed circularly polarized light are simulated by finite element method. The results show that this structure can produce operable circular dichroism and circular polarization filtering effect by adjusting the symmetry and the size of the structure. We illustrate this phenomenon by analyzing the resonance modes of the equivalent dipole between the upper and lower layers under the two excitation modes.
1071	Enhanced luminescence in Tb<sup>3+</sup> doped transparent germanate glass ceramic scintillators containing CaF<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals	Transparent Tb<sup>3+</sup> doped germanate glass ceramics containing CaF<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals were successfully prepared by melt quenching method with subsequent heat treatment. Their micro-structure was investigated by XRD and TEM techniques. Their optical properties were studied by the transmittance, the photoluminescence, and X-ray excited luminescence. All of the luminescence in the glass ceramics under 377 nm light and X-ray excitations has been significantly enhanced. The highest intensity of 545 nm emission the glass ceramic is 5.85 times of that of commercial BGO scintillating crystal, and the highest integrated emission intensity of is about 50% of that of commercial BGO scintillating crystal. The results indicate that transparent Tb<sup>3+</sup> doped germanate glass ceramic could be a promising scintillating material used in X-ray detection for slow event.
1072	<strong>MgCl<sub>2</sub> Passivated ZnO Electron Transporting Layer to Improve PbS Quantum Dot Solar Cells</strong>	The unique tunable bandgaps and straightforward synthesis of colloidal quantum dots make them promising low-cost materials for photovoltaics. High-performance colloidal quantum dot solar cells rely on good-quality electron transporting layers to make carrier selective contacts. Despite extensive use of n-type oxides as electron transporting layers, a detailed understanding of their surface and interface states as well as mechanisms to improve their optical properties are still under development. Here, we report a simple procedure to produce MgCl<sub>2</sub> passivated ZnO nanoparticles electron transporting layers that show improved device performance. The MgCl<sub>2</sub> treated ZnO electron transporting layers boost the PbS colloidal quantum dot cell efficiency from 6.3% to 8.2%. The cell exhibits reduced defects leading to significant improvements of both FF and J<sub>sc</sub>. This low-temperature MgCl<sub>2</sub> treated ZnO electron transporting layer may be applied in solution processed tandem cells as a promising strategy to further increase cell efficiencies.
1073	<strong>Self-powered high responsivity (10<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>5</sup>A/W) broad band (300-1100nm) photodetector based on a single Ge nanowire.</strong>	Self-powered photodetectors have been fabricated from a single Germanium nanowire (NW) in metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) device configuration. The self-powered devices fabricated from the Ge NWs show high responsivity with no external bias in the range of 10<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>5</sup>A/W in the wavelength range from 300-1100 nm. The smallest optical power detectable by such a device is from 10<sup>-13</sup>-10<sup>-15</sup>W, limited by the dark current noise. We have fabricated each device with one type of electrode material only. In one device we use Nickel and in the other two devices Cr/Au electrodes to establish that the observed phenomenon does not depend on specific metal electrodes. The experimental data were analyzed using COMSOL<sup>&reg; </sup>Multiphysics module to establish that the asymmetric Schottky Barrier Height (SBH) at the metal contacts in the MSM device is a major cause for the observed zero bias photoresponse that leads to self-powered photodetectors.  The asymmetry in SBH leads to a &ldquo;built-in&rdquo; axial field so that even without an externally applied bias the photogenerated carriers can be separated, which then diffuse to the appropriate electrodes driven by the &ldquo;built-in&rdquo; axial field. We point out different physical origins that can lead to unequal barrier heights in seemingly identical NW/metal junctions in the MSM device.
1074	Enhancement of Optical Emission and Ion Currents in a Laser Produced Silicon Plasma by Femtosecond Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structuring	Laser-induced periodic surface structuring is a powerful technique for modifying the surface properties of solids. Using ultrashort pulses from a Ti:Sapphire laser (800 nm, 100 fs) we have fabricated nanoscale order laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) on a silicon (100) surface. The LIPSS patterns are found to be strongly dependent on the laser pulse energy, state of polarization, number of shots delivered on the target, and the ambient pressure. The role of laser wavelength is studied by using the second harmonic output (400 nm) also for fabrication. Large area (5x4 mm2) surface structuring has been carried out at atmospheric pressure after optimizing the laser parameters at 800 nm. The patterned silicon surface shows a substantial reduction in the reflection of incident light over a wide range of wavelengths, in comparison to plain silicon. Moreover, when used for laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) experiments, enhanced optical emission and ion current have been observed from the patterned surface. This indicates that coupling of laser energy to the surface is enhanced in the case of patterned silicon. While spectral lines emitted by doubly ionized silicon have been observed from the patterned surface, the plain surface gives lines from singly ionized silicon only. A discernible enhancement has been measured in both optical (50-90%) and electrical (34%) signals from the plasma generated on the patterned surface. These results confirm that LIPSS is a versatile method for enhancing the coupling of laser energy on to irradiated solid surfaces.
1075	Pressure induced  anomalous magnetic behaviour in nanocrystalline YCrO<sub>3</sub> at room temperature	High pressure behaviour of nanocrystalline YCrO<sub>3</sub> is investigated up to 10 GPa using electrical, magnetic, synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy measurements. High pressure dielectric constant measurements show a sharp peak at 4.5 GPa, though the sample is found to be in ferroelectric phase up to the highest pressure of our study from piezoelectric current measurements.  X-ray diffraction measurements show absence of any structural phase transition, however anomalies are observed in the unit cell structural parameters at about 4.3 GPa and the Y-atom position shows a maximum shift at the same pressure. In the absence of any structural transition, anomalous behaviour of  relevant Raman modes with minimum in the Raman band width at about same pressure indicate towards a spin-phonon interaction.   AC magnetic measurements in the toroid anvil cell show an anomalous enhancement of magnetic moment above 4 GPa indicating a collective magnetic response of nanoparticles.
1076	<strong>Development of the ZnO-based nanorod arrays as a scintillator layer for ultrafast and high-spatial-resolution X-ray imaging system</strong>	Under excitation with 20 keV and low flux density of X-ray beam, a 1-&mu;m system spatial resolution was initially achieved by using the vertically aligned 18-&mu;m thickness ZnO nanorod arrays as a scintillator layer in X-ray imaging beamline at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The highly uniform and densely packed ZnO-based (ZnO, ZnO:Ga) nanorod arrays were prepared on the ZnO-seeded substrates by hydrothermal reaction method, and the fluorescence decay time measurements indicated that the ultraviolet and visible emissions of the arrays were subnanosecond and nanosecond, respectively. Through hydrogen annealing treatment, the ultraviolet luminescence was intensively enhanced and the visible luminescence was remarkably suppressed simultaneously. In conclusion, it can be determined that the ZnO-based nanorod arrays are the decent candidates for applications in ultrafast and high-spatial-resolution X-ray imaging systems.
1077	Experimental study on the formation of uniform dielectric barrier discharge in atmospheric air	Uniform dielectric barrier discharge (UDBD), excited by nanosecond pulses, is achieved within 8 mm air gap by using a self-designed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) structure in airflow. The self-designed DBD structure is characterized by adding a metal rod (MR) in discharge gap, which will produce a local strong electric field and induce surface and volume discharge. It is observed from sequential periodic images that the discharge uniformity starts from the electrode edge at the airflow inlet and moves gradually toward downstream at the action of airflow. When the discharge uniformity is transmitted to a nearby of MR, a stable uniform and symmetrical annular discharge configuration is formed. Besides, the area of UDBD can be expanded by adding many MRs or MR array in the discharge gap. There is an optimum distance between every two MRs to produce a continuous and maximum uniform discharge area. The above phenomena are mainly ascribed to the change of electric field distribution caused by MR and the charged particles redistribution induced by airflow.
1078	Large negative differential resistance effect induced by Boron-doping in zigzag phagraphene nanoribbon junctions	By applying nonequilibrium Green's function in combination with the density-functional theory, we investigate theselectronic transport properties of boron or nitrogen doped zigzag phagraphene nanoribbon junctions.sOur calculated results show that the negative differential resistance effect could besobserved in zigzag phagraphene nanoribbon junction. Moreover, the peak to valley ratio of the negative differential resistancessignificantly increase from 1.6 to 111.32, when the junction is doped by Boron atoms. We rationalize the mechanism leadingsto negative differential resistance by providing a detailed analysis of transmission spectra and transmission pathways
1079	Multiple-beam optical interferometry of anisotropic soft materials nanoconfined with the Surface Force Apparatus	Soft anisotropic materials that change their macroscopic properties in response to external stimuli such as light, electric field or pressure are central to several new directions of technology, including optics, micro-mechanics and bioengineering. Responsiveness is fundamentally connected to the anisotropic ordering of the material's building blocks at the nanometre scale. Here we propose the Surface Force Apparatus as a powerful tool for investigating optically anisotropic materials at the nanometre scale using multiple-beam optical interference, allowing for simultaneous determination of film thickness, alignment and chiral rotation of the optical axis. We present a method based on 4x4 matrices for calculating the exact transmission and reflection coefficients for light incident normal to a planar optical multilayer comprising an arbitrary number of chiral anisotropic layers with the helical axis normal to the layer. The multilayer can also include uniform birefringent media, optical adsorbing (e.g. metals) and isotropic materials. We introduce a technique to analyse and interpret the complex multiple-beam interference patterns arising from such multilayer, and demonstrate it for the case of a twisted nematic liquid crystal confined to nanoscale thickness with the Surface Force Apparatus. The analysis opens the prospect of studying the effect of strong confinement on the structure and response of a wide class of anisotropic materials.
1080	<strong>Direct Imaging of Surface States Hidden in the Third Layer of </strong><strong>Si (111)-7x7 Surface by <em>P<sub>z</sub></em>-wave Tip</strong>	<strong>Surface states play a significant role in electronic transport </strong><strong>of nano-/atomic scale electronic devices, especially the silicon nanoelectronic devices</strong><strong>. However, despite of the intensive research for over 30 years, the direct visualization of surface states of Si (111)-7&times;7, particularly for the third-layer structures, remain challenging. In this letter, </strong><strong>the partial density of states of the atoms in the reconstructed layers were first examined by the first principles calculations. Based on these results, scanning tunneling spectroscopy images with a <em>p<sub>z</sub></em>-wave tip were carried out, which show a skull pattern at ~0.7 eV, and 9 bright short lines at ~1.00 eV in each unit cell, exhibiting obviously the electronic states from the third-layer atoms and dimers. The unprecedented observation of surface states arising from the buried layers brings precise commensuration with DAS model proposed 33 years ago. T</strong><strong>he improved sensitivity (intensity and resolution) of </strong><strong>scanning tunneling spectroscopy</strong><strong> was ascribed to the enhanced </strong><strong>tunneling matrix elements for <em>p<sub>z</sub></em>-wave tip compared with <em>s</em>-wave tip.

1081	Thermal transport in 2D and 3D nanowire networks	We report on thermal transport properties in 2 and 3 dimensions interconnected nanowire networks. The thermal conductivity of these architectured nanostructures decreases in increasing the distance between the nodes. This effect is much more pronounced in 3D networks due to increased porosity, surface to volume ratio and the enhanced backscattering at 3D nodes compared to 2D nodes. We propose a model to estimate the thermal resistance related to the 2D and 3D interconnections in order to provide an analytic description of thermal conductivity of such nanowire networks; the latter is in good agreement with Molecular Dynamic results. The backscattering processes in the nodes increase the thermal resistance by a factor of 5 compared to simple nanowires.
1082	Transition to Electrokinetic Instability near Imperfect Charge-Selective Membranes. Direct Numerical Simulation	The hydrodynamics and electrostatics of imperfect electric membranes are examined numerically. The investigation is based on the Nernst&ndash;Planck&ndash;Poisson&ndash;Stokes system of equations. A three-layer geometry, electrolyte&ndash;nanoporous membrane&ndash;electrolyte, is considered. The threshold of the electrokinetic instability of the one-dimensional quiescent state and the corresponding change of the current regime to the overlimiting one are studied. A map of the bifurcations, transitions, and regimes is constructed in coordinates of the selectivity, the applied potential difference, and the Debye number.<br />s<p>For good membrane selectivity the hydrodynamics and electrostatics are quantitatively the same as for perfect membranes: the instability is monotonic and nonequilibrium and the voltage&ndash;current (VC) characteristic has all three portions: the underlimiting, limiting, and overlimiting regimes. For intermediate selectivity, the imperfect membrane behaves qualitatively as a perfect membrane. For poor membrane selectivity, the nonequilibrium electro-osmosis turns to the equilibrium one and the monotonic instability is replaced by an oscillatory one. The concept of slip velocity loses its meaning, surface spike-like coherent structures disappear, and the equilibrium instability is caused by the bulk residual charge. For poor membrane selectivity, the VC characteristic dramatically changes: transition to the overlimiting currents occurs, bypassing the limiting current regime.</p>s<p>There is a qualitative agreement between theoretical prediction and experimental observations of the microvortex expansion.
1083	A Novel Characterization Technique for Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles: the Superparamagnetic Quantifier, Compared with Magnetic Particle Spectroscopy	Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are used as a tracer material in sentinel node biopsies. The latter is a procedure to analyze if cancer cells have spread to lymph nodes, helping to personalize patient care. To predict SPION behavior in vivo, it is important to analyze their magnetic properties in biological environments. The superparamagnetic quantifier (SPaQ) is a new device to measure the dynamic magnetization curve of SPIONs. The magnetization curve was measured for two types of SPIONs: Resovist and SHP-25. We used three techniques: Vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), Magnetic Particle Spectroscopy (MPS) and our new Superparamagnetic Quantier (SPaQ). Furthermore, AC susceptibility (ACS) measurements were performed as part of the evaluation of the three techniques. SPaQ and VSM results were found to be similar. Measurement results were nearly identical in both directions, indicating minor hysteresis. However, in MPS measurements a clear hysteresis loop was observed. Furthermore, the ACS measurements showed a pronounced Brownian maximum, indicating an optimal response for an AC frequency below 10 kHz for both particle systems. Both the SPaQ and MPS were found to be superior to VSM, since measurements are faster, can be performed at room temperature and are particularly sensitive to particle dynamics. The main difference between the SPaQ and MPS lies in the excitation sequence. The SPaQ combines an alternating magnetic field that has a low amplitude with a gradual DC offset, whereas MPS uses only an alternating field that has a large amplitude. In conclusion, both the SPaQ and MPS are highly suited to improve understanding SPION behavior, which will lead to the radical improvement of sentinel node biopsy accuracy.
1084	Mechanical milling: a sustainable route to induce structural transformations in nano-MoS2 for applications in the treatment of contaminated water	Besides graphene, a new 2D material, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), has attracted immense interest in various applications. On the other hand, ball-milling process provides an original strategy to modify materials at the nanometer scale. This methodology represents a smart solution for the fabrication of MoS2 nanopowders extremely-efficient in adsorbing water contaminants. This work reports a comprehensive investigation of the adsorption performance of ball-milled MoS2 nanopowders. Importantly, the ball-milled MoS2 nanopowders can be easily and efficiently regenerated without compromising their adsorption capacity. The present results demonstrate that ball-milling of MoS2 offers a valid method for large-scale production of extremely efficient adsorbent.
1085	<strong>Modifying the semi-empirical Halpin-Tsai model for thermal conductivity of polymer nanocomposites containing carbon nanotubes</strong>	A new version of the semi-empirical Halpin-Tsai (H-T) model is presented to evaluate the effective thermal conductivity of general carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-reinforced polymer nanocomposites. The model captures the influences of the CNTs alignment, random orientation, aggregation, waviness, length, diameter and the CNT/polymer interfacial thermal resistance parameters. In order to verify the suitability of the new H-T model, the numerically calculated thermal conductivities are compared with existing experimentally measured ones. It is found an excellent predictability of the modified H-T model over a wide range of the tests. The consideration of the CNT waviness and the interfacial thermal resistance parameters is seriously essential for a more realistic prediction in all conditions. For aligned CNT-reinforced polymer nanocomposites, considering the alignment factor seems to be very important. Moreover, in the case of well-dispersed CNTs into the matrix, it is necessary to incorporate the CNT random orientation parameter. Additionally, when CNTs are no well-dispersed, the CNT aggregation and random orientation parameters must be incorporated in the analysis. The effects of the CNT volume fraction, length, diameter and non-straight shape on the nanocomposite thermal conducting behavior are estimated in details. The results clearly expose that it is needed to eliminate the aggregation, use the straight CNTs and form a strong interface if the full potential of CNT reinforcement is to be realized. Finally, the thermal conductivities of CNT-shape memory polymer (SMP) nanocomposites at different temperatures are obtained.
1086	Temperature dependence of radiative lifetimes, optical and electronic properties of silicon nanocrystals capped with various organic ligands	Despite the known temperature effects on the optical and photoluminescence properties of silicon nanocrystals (Si NCs), most of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations thus far have been carried out at zero temperature, i.e. fixed atomic positions. We present a study of the effect of finite temperature on the radiative lifetimes and band gaps of Si NCs capped with six different organic ligands, CH<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H5,C<sub>2</sub>H4Cl}, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>OH, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>SH, and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>. In addition, we show the differences in electronic and optical properties, as well as the wavefunctions (WF) around the band gap, of the capped Si NCs at zero temperature. We show that the NCs capped with alkyl and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Cl ligands have larger HOMO-LUMO and optical absorption gaps compared to the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>OH, and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>SH capped NCs. We demonstrate that this big difference in both gaps comes from the increased contribution to the states at the top of the valence band from the NH<sub>2</sub>, OH and SH groups of the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>OH, and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>SH ligands, respectively. Additionally, we assigned the rather weak dependence of the radiative lifetimes of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> capped NCs on the NC size to the slightly changing symmetry of the highly localized HOMO WF at the NH<sub>2</sub> group. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the temperature effect on the radiative lifetimes and band gaps is larger in alkyl and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Cl capped Si NCs. We indicate that the decrease in radiative lifetime of the CH<sub>3</sub> capped NCs with increasing temperature comes from the changing symmetry of the LUMO WF and the increased dipolar overlap between the HOMO and LUMO WFs. Lastly, we show that there is a constant decrease in the band gaps of the Si NCs with increasing size, with the band gap change of CH<sub>3</sub> capped NCs being larger compared to the band gap change of the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> capped NCs.
1087	Article	We present results of experiments to determine the dispersion of the plasmon modes associated with Au nanowire gratings with a fixed spatial frequency (&nu; = 3370 mm<sup>-1</sup>) and different slits between the nanowires, fabricated using an interference lithography technique. Optical properties of fabricated plasmonic structures were studied using measurements of spectral and angular dependence of P and S-polarized extinction in the wavelength range 0.4-1.1 microns, angles of incidence of 10 - 70 degrees in conical mounting (at variable azimuth angle in the range &phi; = 0 - 90 degrees).s<p>It was shown, that in the grating with the average slit between the nanowires equal to half of the grating period at &phi; = 0 only local plasmons (LP) are excited by P-polarized light. When the azimuth angle changes from 0 to 90&#x02DA;, the intensity of the exited LP is smoothly "transfered" from the P- to the S-polarized excitation, and at &phi; ~ 30-45 degrees the intensities of the LP bands in both polarizations are approximately equal. However, in the sample with narrow slits between the nanowires (40 nm) we observe the mixed mode with excitation both surface plasmon polariton (SPP) and LP in the P-polarization at &phi; = 0. With increasing azimuth, the intensity of mixed LP-SPP mode in P-polarization decreases and transformed into pure LP-mode in S-polarization with maximum intensity at &phi; = 90&#x02DA;.
1088	<strong><strong>Unconventional Thermal Transport in Thin Film-on-Substrate Systems</strong></strong>	Thin film-on-substrate are ubiquitously found architectures in nanostructured optoelectronic devices. We study thermal transport in thin films mounted over substrates and observe an unconventional behavior of thermal conductivity variation with film thickness, which is opposite to predictions for free-standing thin films. Specifically, we find an increased thermal conductivity with decreasing thickness which is attributed to phonon injection from substrate media. We provide a study of the influence of interlayer thermal phonon coupling between thin film and substrate on the thermal conductivity of the film and contrast it with bulk and free-standing thin-film values. We consider optoelectronic relevant Ge thin films grown over Si substrate and Al<sub>0.1</sub>Ga<sub>0.9</sub>As thin films grown over GaAs substrate. The novel guidelines and insights on coupled thermal transport introduced here can enable rational thermal material design for optoelectronic applications.
1089	Noise mitigation methods for ion detectors operating with a direct view of high temperature plasmas	We have developed an ion current measurement instrument with a direct view of a plasma that reduces the particle and radiation-induced noise current it detects by over three orders of magnitude, from tens of microamps to tens of nanoamps. This is accomplished using electric and magnetic fields and physical shielding which limit the flux of particles and radiation into the instrument and suppress secondary electrons produced within it by particle and radiation impact. Operation of this detector in various configurations, without an ion beam, has allowed identification of the sources of noise current. In our experimental setup, the largest noise contributors were found to be plasma ions and photoelectric emission due to UV radiation.
1090	Ab Initio Response Functions for Cherenkov-based Neutron Detectors	Neutron time-of-flight (nToF) diagnostics at the NIF were recently outfitted with Cherenkov detectors. A fused silica radiator delivers sub-nanosecond response time, and is optically coupled to a MCP-PMT with gains from ~1 to 10<sup>4</sup>. Capitalizing on its fast response time and sensitivity to gamma rays, these systems provide better than 30 ps precision in measurements of the first moment of neutron distributions. Generation of <i>ab initio</i> instrument response functions (IRF) is critical to meet the &lt;1% uncertainty needed.  A combination of Monte Carlo modeling, benchtop characterization, and in-situ comparison is employed. Close agreement is shown between modeled IRFs and <i>in-situ</i> measurements using the NIF's ARC beams, configured to generate high energy photons with 10-ps terawatt laser pulses onto a gold target.  Calculated 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> moments from DT neutron spectra agree well with established scintillator measurements and show reduced dependence on IRFs. Next-step designs offer increased sensitivity and time-response.
1091	<strong>SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF</strong><strong>LaMn<sub>1-x</sub>Fe<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2) BY COPRECIPITATIONROUTE</strong>	Perovskite type oxides are fascinating nanomaterials and itsphysical properties of interest tomaterials science through perovskites include superconductivity, magnetoresistance, ionicconductivity, and a multitude of dielectric properties, which are of great importance inmicroelectronics and telecommunication. Recently interest has arisen in perovskite-type oxidesas catalysts due to high thermal and hydrothermal stability as well as high mechanical strength among other properties. In the present work, LaMn<sub>1-x</sub>Fe<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> perovskite was synthesized by the co-precipitation method. The product was characterized with X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and conductivity study. TheXRD pattern confirmed the formation of perovskite phase. The SEM micrographs indicated that the morphology contain porosity due to inter-particle voids. The presence of functional groups of the pure and doped lanthanum manganite were studied by FTIR.The optical band gap decrease with increasing the content of iron in the sample. The conductivity study confirmed that the conductivity increases with increasing the content of iron.
1092	<strong>Effect of temperature on GaSb nanocell lattice fabrication by focused ion beam </strong>	The effect of sample temperature during ion irradiation was investigated on GaSb nanocell fabrication by a technique using focused ion beam (FIB).  Two-dimensional nanocell lattices with a cell interval of 100 nm were fabricated on GaSb (001) wafer at a cryogenic temperature (135 K) and room temperature (297 K). It was shown, from observations by plan view and cross-sectional view of a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), that the nanocell lattice develops slowly at 135 K with increasing ion dose, and that it does fast at 297 K being disturbed by newly created secondary voids.  These results were discussed using migration parameters of point defects deduced from the recovery data of electron irradiated GaSb reported by Thommen.  The difference of nanocell fabrication between 135 K and 297 K was explained by temperature dependence of mobility of interstitials and vacancies. In order to miniaturize the nanocell, fabrication of nanocell lattices was conducted by ion irradiation at 123, 173, 223 and 297 K.  Ordered nanocell lattices with a 50 nm cell interval were obtained at 173 K and 297 K. The conditions about the mobility of irradiation-induced point defects for fabrication of ordered nanocell lattices were derived from the obtained experimental results.

1094	<strong>A novel grey and porous SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles</strong>	In this letter, XRD, TEM, SEM, XPS and Raman techniques are selected to probe the composition and microstructure of porous G-SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles. We find that porous nanoparticles with Si vacancies play an important role in expanding the absorption edge to visible-light region. Besides, we first establish the relation between dielectric constant and optical absorption coefficient.
1095	Frequency-driven bulk-to-surface transition of conductivity in ZnO nanowires	The frequency of an applied AC voltage dramatically affects the nature of conductivity in zinc oxide nanowires. The nanowires exhibit a continuous transition from positive to negative photoconductivity as a function of the driving frequency with the characteristic frequency of 48.9 kHz. In addition, ZnO nanowires exhibit a frequency-driven metal-insulator transition appearing at the same characteristic frequency. The responsible mechanism for both transitions is attributed to the switching of conductivity from bulk conduction to surface conduction. A theoretical model is presented describing the experimental observations. The origin of the negative photoconductivity in semiconductor nanowires is discussed based on the surface conduction. The frequency-driven bulk-to-surface transition of conductivity is expected to be generic characters of semiconductor nanostructures with the large surface-to-volume ratio.
1096	A combined molecular dynamics simulation and quantum mechanics study on the physisorption of biodegradable CBNAILs on h-BN nanosheets	The nanoscopic structure of biodegradable choline-based naphthenic acid ionic liquids (CBNAILs) near the hexagonal boron-nitride (h-BN) surface was analyzed using quantum mechanics calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The effects of the type of ring (aliphatic or aromatic) and the size of the ring in the anion counterpart of the aliphatic ILs on the configurations, binding energies, orbital energies, density of states, charge transfer and thermochemistry of adsorption of ILs on the h-BN surface were investigated. Also the significance of non-covalent interactions on the adsorption of ILs was disclosed from reduced density gradient (RDG) and the quantum theory of atoms in molecule (QTAIM). The results of radial distribution functions (RDFs), number density and also charge density profiles showed the existence of a solid-like bottom layer in the vicinity of surface. Angular distribution functions revealed that while the most probable orientation in aromatic anions is parallel to the h-BN sheet, the most probable orientation in aliphatic rings apparently is perpendicular to the surface. The mobility of cations and anions in the studied ILs with respect to the h-BN sheet was analyzed using their mean square displacements (MSDs). For all ions near the surface, dynamics in the parallel direction were faster than those in the z-direction due to the structuring of the solid-like layer of ILs near the h-BN surface. Altogether, this study provides new insights on the physisorption of this new class of biodegradable ILs on h-BN nanosheets at molecular level.
1097	<strong>Optical switching of memory effect in Au/TiO<sub>2</sub>/ITO/ZnO:Al/p-Si</strong> <strong>heterostructure based on nanoparticles</strong>	We have successfully realized a nonvolatile resistive memory structure by rf-magnetron sputtering technique using nanoparticles synthesized by sol-gel method.s<p>The resistive switching (RS) related to the Au/TiO<sub>2</sub>Schottky contact was graft on a photosensitive structure ITO/ZnO:Al/p-Si allowing memory effect switching optically activated. The RS takes place via tunneling path through potential barrier located at the Au/TiO<sub>2</sub> interface. The memory effect persists under illumination and the Arrhenius plot of the surface of the V-I cycle shows an activation energy about 160 meV in dark and 100 meV under visible illumination. This behavior of the RS optically activated is closely related to the electronic states in the Au/TiO<sub>2</sub> interface.
1098	Tuning exchange-dominated spin-waves using lateral current spread in nanocontact spin-torque nano-oscillators	We present an efficient method to tailor propagating spin waves in quasi-confined systems. We use nanocontact spin-torque nano-oscillators based on NiFe/Cu/Co spin-valves and study the ferromagnetic and spin-wave resonances (FMR and SWR) of both layers. We employ homodyne-detected ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, resembling spin-torque FMR, to detect the magnetodynamics. The external field is applied in-plane, giving a parallel configuration of the magnetic layers, which do not provide any spin-transfer torque. Instead, the excitation is caused by the Oersted-field. By varying the thickness of the bottom Cu electrode of the devices, we tune the current distribution in the samples, and thereby the Oersted field, which governs the spin wave characteristics.
1099	Transport properties of nanometer-scale-thick TiSe<sub>2</sub> epitaxial thin films	Charge-density wave (CDW) is one of the most fundamental collective phenomena prominent in low-dimensional systems. Of particular interest is the CDW phase in a prototypical layered transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) TiSe<sub>2</sub>, where the CDW is known to form with commensurate 2<em>a</em> &times; 2<em>a</em> &times; 2<em>c</em> structural distortion at <em>T</em> = 200 K (where <em>a</em> and <em>c</em> are the lattice parameters). Recent experimental studies have revealed intriguing aspects of this material as represented by emergence of superconductivity upon electron doping as well as possible existence of the excitonic insulator phase, making TiSe<sub>2</sub> attractive as a model material for investigation of collective phenomena in TMDC. However, the evolution of the CDW phase at nanometer-scale thickness has not been well investigated yet in particular from transport viewpoints, presumably due to difficulty in fabrication of nanometer-scale thick TiSe<sub>2</sub> samples by conventional mechanical exfoliation. Here we report transport properties of nanometer-scale-thick highly-crystalline TiSe<sub>2</sub> epitaxial thin films grown on insulating Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> substrates by molecular-beam epitaxy, demonstrating robust CDW transitions down to 5 monolayers (3 nm). We also clarify an interesting aspect of van der Waals epitaxy, a &lsquo;self-rotational&rsquo; growth without strain, which should be realized only in a system having weak substrate-film interaction.
1100	Potential of Mean Force for two Nanocrystals: Core Geometry and Size, Hydrocarbon Unsaturation and Universality with Respect to the Force Field	We present a detailed analysis of the interaction between two nanocrystals capped with ligands consisting of hydrocarbon chains by united atom molecular dynamics simulations. We analyze large cores (up to 10 nm in diameter), ligands with unsaturated carbon bonds (oleic acid) and we investigate the accuracy of the computed potential of mean force by comparing different force fields. We also analyze the vortices that determine the bonding, including the case of asymmetric nanocrystals and discuss effects related to the intrinsic anisotropy of the core. Overall  our results are in agreement with the predictions of the recently proposed Orbifold Topological Model (OTM).
1101	Interfacial thermal conductance of buckling carbon nanotubes	Bond transition of sp2 to sp3 in carbon nanotube can be realized through bending operation at buckling location, which affects the electronic, mechanical and thermal properties of buckled carbon nanotube. In this work, thermal properties of buckled tri-walled carbon nanotube with sp3 bonds are explored using molecular dynamics. Our results reveal that interfacial thermal conductance at buckling location is sensitive to the bending angle, which decreases exponentially with increasing bending angle until 90 degree, meanwhile, the amount of sp3 at intershall increases. When the bending angle is beyond 90 degree, there are intralayer sp3 bonds formed which provide new thermal dissipation path and thus increases thermal conductance. The insight of mechanism of thermal properties is analyzed by determining atomic micro-heat flux scattering. Our findings provide a flexible and applicable method to design thermal management device. This unusual phenomenon is explained by the micro-heat flux migration and stress distributions. Our findings on the graphene origami enable the design of the next generation thermal management devices and flexible electronics with tunable properties.
1102	Glassy dynamics of two poly(ethylene glycol) derivatives in the bulk and in nanometric confinement as reflected in its inter- and intra-molecular interactions	The inter- and intra-molecular interactions as they evolve in the course of glassy solidification are studied by Broadband Dielectric (BDS) - and Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) - Spectroscopy for two low molecular poly(ethylene glycol) derivatives, namely poly(ethylene glycol) phenyl ether acrylate and poly(ethylene glycol) dibenzoate in the bulk and under confinement in nanoporous silica having mean pore diameters 4, 6 and 8 nm, with native and silanized inner surfaces. Analyzing the spectral positions and the oscillator strengths of specific IR absorption bands and their temperature dependencies, enables one to trace the changes in the intra-molecular potentials and to compare it with the dielectrically determined primarily inter-molecular dynamics. Special emphasis is given to the calorimetric glass transition temperature Tg and T&#x03B1;&#x03B2;&#x2248;1.25Tg, where characteristic changes in conformation appear, and the secondary &#x03B2;-relaxation merges with the dynamic glass transition (&#x03B1;-relaxation). Furthermore, the impact of main chain conformations, inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding and nanometric confinement on the dynamic glass transition is unraveled.
1103	Ultra-Low-Density Silver Aerogels via Freeze-Substitution	Herein is reported a method for fabricating &lt;10 mg/cm3 silver aerogels via the freeze casting of aqueous nanowire suspensions followed by freeze substitution and supercritical drying. This method overcomes the limitations of traditional freeze drying and yields highly uniform, crack-free monoliths that undergo no measurable shrinkage with excellent mold reproduction. Significantly, freeze substitution enables the use of high concentrations of cryoprotectants to control the freezing process and, hence, the pore architecture of resulting aerogels. Due to its physical nature, this method is applicable to the fabrication of materials with a broad range of compositions.
1104	Size and Dimensionality Dependent Melting Temperature of Nanomaterials	This study aims to characterize the size and dimensionality dependent melting temperature of nanomaterials. Considering that surface atoms and interior atoms affect the melting of materials in different manners, thus we define an equivalent relationship between the contribution of surface atoms and interior atoms. Based on this definition, a criterion of melting is proposed through introducing a critical energy storage density of melting, the sum of the contribution of surface atoms and the interior atoms. According to the proposed criterion, a new theoretical model without any adjustable parameters is developed to characterize the size effect of melting temperatures of nanomaterials. The model predictions are in good agreement with the available experimental data or molecular dynamics simulations. This model uncovers the quantitative relationship between the melting temperature, size, atomic diameter and dimensionality of nanomaterials. In addition, this model is extended to predict the size dependent glass transition temperatures of polymers. This study can help to better understand and characterize the size dependent melting temperatures of nanomaterials, as well as the size dependent glass transition temperatures of polymers.
1105	<strong>Mechanism of liquid-phase reductive thin-film deposition under quasiballistic electron incidence</strong>	Highly reducing activity of quasiballistic hot electrons emitted from a nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) diode is verified in terms of liquid-phase thin film deposition. Incident electrons reduce positive ions in salt solutions coated on a target substrate, and then result in deposition of thin metal (Cu) and semiconducting (Si, Ge, and SiGe) films. This mechanism is investigated here throughout the process from electron incidence to thin film deposition. Thermodynamic criterion deduced from classical nucleation theory suggests that the output electron energy of the nc-Si emitter is suitable for promoting preferential reduction of target ions in solutions leading to the nuclei formation. In accordance with mass-transport analyses on generated nanoclusters, the most primary factor of thin film growth is the dose of incident electron. The formulated deposition rate rapidly increases and reaches a stationary value within 0.1 s after electron incidence. The theoretical dependency of the thin film thickness on the electron incidence time is consistent with the experimental results. Specific features of this scheme as an alternative approach for thin film deposition are discussed in comparison with the conventional dry and wet processes.
1106	<strong><em>Optoelectric charging-discharging of Ge nanocrystals in floating gate memory</em></strong>	Photo-induced effects on charging and discharging of nanocrystals (NCs) in capacitor memories with Ge NCs in HfO<sub>2</sub> matrix as a floating gate layer are studied. The sequence of layers HfO<sub>2</sub>/Ge-HfO<sub>2</sub>/HfO<sub>2</sub> was deposited on p-Si substrate using magnetron sputtering. Well separated Ge NCs are obtained after rapid thermal annealing at 600<sup>o</sup>C. The optoelectric capacitor memories were fabricated with a transparent electrode on top of the structure and Al electrode on the back side of Si substrate. The light illumination in the rage 5 &ndash; 20 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> can induce changes in the hysteresis curves with a photosensitivity peak value of 60 &ndash; 80% for different programming and measurement regimes. The stored information about electrical and optical pulses is also investigated in the regime of the flat band potential measurements (retention measurements). It is shown that in our memory structure, the photo-effect on the memory retention corresponds to a transfer of negative charges from Si substrate to Ge NCs, up to a mean value of 1.6 electrons per NC.
1107	Functionalizing self-assembled nanostructured a-Si:Al films	Thin films of vertically aligned Al nanowires of 5 nm diameter within an amorphous silicon matrix (a-Si) has been fabricated. This work studies functionalization of these structures by removal of the Al nanowires. The nanowires removal has been monitored by several electron microscopy techniques , XRD, RBS and optical reflectance. Complete removal results in a structure of vertically aligned nanochannels in a-Si. It has been established that optical reflectance measurements can reliably identify the complete removal of Al. This provides a robust and relatively simple method for controlling the nano-fabrication process on a macroscopic scale.
1108	Terrace morphology on fused silica surfaces by Ar<sup>+</sup> ion bombardment with Mo co-deposition	The morphology evolution of self-organized nanopatterns induced during Ar+ ion bombardment (IB), with and without Mo co-deposition on fused silica (SiO2) surfaces at different incidence angles and fluences, was investigated by using atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. <br />For pure IB at incidence angles from 30&deg; to 70&deg;, SiO2 surfaces exhibit from smooth, via ripple to direction-transversed ripples. In contrast, at the same ion fluence and incidence angles, the simultaneous Mo co-deposition leads to significant terraced structures on SiO2 even at low fluences with significantly enhanced roughness and wavelength. Our observations show that the concurrent Mo co-deposition during IB can reduce the critical incidence angle and fluence level of the terrace formation. The terrace angles are displaced with the variation of incidence angle, but are always located at the stable facet where the local incidence angles are close to the normal or grazing incidence, corresponding to the minimal sputtering yield. <br />Owing to the guidance of the IB-induced morphology, at incidence angles where a well-ordered ripple-mode can be generated, the formation of well-ordered facet morphology is more likely than at a higher or lower angle where the ripple-mode grows weakly. Terraced structures are initiated and further grow until the arrival of the nonlinear phase, i.e., where the ripple amplitude is sufficiently high.<br />The enhanced terrace morphology on smooth SiO2 results from the interplay between pure IB and Mo co-deposition, which includes the angle dependence and an impurity-modulated sputtering yield induced by phase separation and shadow effect.
1109	High Cross-Plane Thermoelectric Performance of Anisotropic 3-Dimentional CNT Sponge	In this study, the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are packed to prepare CNT films with the chemical-vapor-deposition method, then the films are piled up to make anisotropic 3-dimentional CNT sponges (CNS). This sponge is demonstrated to be a promising thermoelectric material. Its cross-plane figure of merit (ZT<sub>&perp;</sub>) is much larger than that along the in-plane direction (ZT<sub>&#x2225;</sub>), and the maximum ZT<sub>&perp;</sub> is about 2.99&times;10<sup>-3</sup> at 290 K, which is much larger than that of CNT-based materials, including CNTs and CNT/polymer nanocomposites. This high ZT<sub>&perp;</sub> results from the quite low thermal conductivity of CNS in the cross-plane direction, which is due to the small size of pores in CNS and the low <em>k</em> of CNTs along the radial direction. Our results provide a promising route to design high thermoelectric materials.
1110	<strong>Probing plasmon excitations in copper nano-clusters with spectroscopic ellipsometry</strong>	Light induced <em>plasmon excitations</em> of copper nano-clusters have been probed using spectroscopic ellipsometry. Copper clusters of typically 20 nm diameter were created on the surface of a silicon wafer by means of physical vapour deposition. The growth of the clusters as well as the chemical interaction with atmosphere are monitored. Clear <em>plasmon excitations</em> are observed with resonance positions in the range from 1.85 to 2.1 eV for copper in its metallic state. The resonance position and amplitude scale linear with deposited amounts. Changes in resonance position and amplitude are observed when copper nano-clusters are exposed to atmosphere and a sub-nanometer thin copper oxide is formed. The resonance position red-shifts 0.4 eV (180 nm wavelength) after one day of exposure with respect to its metallic state. Spectroscopic ellipsometry is shown to have good sensitivity to ultra-thin (down to sub-nanometer thick) metal-oxide layers as well as to nanometer size changes of the copper nano-clusters. This puts the technique in a position where real-time monitoring of plasmon active material in gaseous or liquid environments of, for example, (photo-) catalytic processes becomes accessible.
1111	Exploration of the electronic properties of patterned Ga-As codoped stanene monolayers from DFT calculations	Stanene is considered as promising candidate for the design and development of future electronic and optoelectronic devices. Density functional theory calculations were performed to examine the structural and electronic properties of the Ga, As and Ga-As codoped stanene sheets in order to fully exploit the semiconductor characteristics of these materials. The tenability of the band gap of the intrinsic stanene through codoping of Ga and As atoms were investigated in detail. Our density functional theory calculations predict that a band gap is opened around the Fermi level in stanene by patterned Ga and As codoping, while the Dirac cone vanishes. Thus, Ga-As codoped stanene behaves as an efficient semiconductor material. In the Ga-doped stanene, the Fermi level shifts to the valence band edge, which indicates that the Ga-doped stanene is a metallic system. In contrast, the As-doped stanene shows the shift of the Fermi level to the conduction band edge. Moreover, Ga-As codoping in stanene opens up a broader band gap in comparison with the mono Ga-doped and As-doped systems. The formation energy calculations indicate that Ga-As codoping is energetically more favorable than As-doping than Ga-doping. The total electron density distribution plots indicate the formation of chemical bond at the doped sites. As a result, Ga-As codoped stanene exhibits a better semiconducting characteristics, and can be applied as a promising material for nanosensors and nanoelectronic devices.
1112	<strong>Evolutions of foamed aluminum melt at high rate tension: mechanical model based on atomistic simulations</strong>	Dynamics of foamed metal melt relates to the following problems: cavitations in melt at negative pressure; ablation and nanostructuring of the surface layer of materials under the action of powerful picosecond laser pulses; additive manufacturing; production of solid foamed metals. We propose a mechanical model of the foamed melt evolution at the stage of bubble enlargement&ndash;after the completion of their nucleation and before the breaking of the inter-bubble walls. The foamed melt is considered as a system of strongly connected bubbles; their size variations are driven by surface forces. The interconnected system of equations for the second time derivatives of the bubble radii is derived by using the Lagrange formalism. The model is verified by comparison with the molecular dynamic (MD) simulation data for aluminum melt at high-rate uniform tension. An algorithm for searching of individual pores is developed and used to analyze the MD data. The size distribution of pores in the melt at the considered stage of enlargement is found to be close to the normal distribution. Evolution of the foamed melt structure is completely determined by the surface tension. The surface tension makes the largest bubbles growing and all the smaller bubbles collapsing, which leads to rapid reduction of the total number of bubbles. The foamed melt maintains negative pressure determined only by the size distribution of bubbles and the surface tension coefficient.

1114	Non-Equilibrium Phenomena and Kinetic Pathways in Self-Assembled Polyelectrolyte Complexes	Polyelectrolyte complexation has been conventionally focused on the thermodynamic states, where assemblies have equilibrated in solutions. Far less attention has been given to complex systems that are kinetically trapped at non-equilibrium states. A combination of time-resolved dynamic light scattering (DLS), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) was employed here to investigate the internal structures and morphological evolution of non-equilibrium aggregates forming from a pair of two strong polyelectrolytes over wide time and length scales. The role of formation pathways of electrostatically driven aggregates was assessed using two processing protocols: Direct Dissolution and Salt Annealing. The former led to thermodynamically stable products while the latter resulted in kinetically trapped transient structures. After adding salt, the metastable structures gradually transformed into stable products. Cryo-TEM images showed the interconnected irregular morphologies of the aggregates and SAXS data revealed the presence of fuzzy globular complexes with Rg ~10 nm within them. A two-step process in the time-dependent structural transformation was found and characterized by a fast breakdown of interconnected transient aggregates followed by a slow redistribution of the incipient individual electrostatic assemblies. Further, the prolonged aggregate disintegration process fitting to a stretched exponential function unveiled the broad relaxation distribution and significant structural heterogeneity in these polyelectrolyte complex nanoaggregates. This work brings new insight into the comprehension of non-equilibrium phenomena in self-assembled electrostatic assemblies and can be a primitive step toward constructing far-from-equilibrium polyelectrolyte complexes de novo for future applications.
1115	Numerical Study of the Potential for Graphene Coated Copper Electrodes to Withstand the Impact of Incident Energetic Carbon Atoms	Thin nanoscale coating of metal electrodes by graphene promises to be a useful approach in suppressing secondary electron yield.  Recent calculations showed reductions by as much as 50 percent for graphene over copper electrodes for energies below 125 eV, with the results in agreement with experimental data.  Here the robustness and resistance to possible degradation of such a coated electrode, in response to incoming atomic projectiles, is gauged based on Molecular Dynamics simulations.  Our results for surface irradiation by carbon atoms (as an example) with nanoscale graphene coating on copper, indicate a defect threshold of about 35 eV, lower surface damage for thicker layers, negligible sputtering and defects less than 6 Angstroms in dimension for incident energies up to 300 eV.
1116	Broadband optomechanical transduction of nanomagnetic spin modes	The stable vortex state that occurs in micron-scale magnetic disks is one of the most interesting and potentially useful phenomenon in nanomagnetism. A variety of tools have been applied to study the vortex state, and collective spin excitations corresponding to harmonic motion of the vortex, but to-date these tools have measured either strongly driven vortex resonances or have been unable to simultaneously measure static properties such as the magnetization. Here we show that by combining the sensitivity of cavity optomechanics with the technique of torque mixing resonance spectroscopy, we are able to measure the magnetization, in-plane susceptibility, and spin resonances of individual vortices in the low-drive limit. These measurements elucidate the complex behavior of the vortex as it moves through the pinning landscape of the disk. Furthermore, we observe gyrotropic resonances as high as 1.1 GHz, suggesting the use of engineering defects for applications such as microwave-to-optical wavelength conversion.

1118	Sub-nanosecond Single Line-of-Sight (SLOS) X-ray Imagers	A new generation of fast-gated x-ray framing cameras have been developed that are capable of capturing multiple frames along a single line-of-sight with 30 ps temporal resolution. The instruments are constructed by integrating pulse-dilation electron imaging with burst mode hybrid-CMOS sensors. Two such instruments have been developed, characterized and fielded at the National Ignition Facility and the OMEGA laser. These instruments are particularly suited for advanced x-ray imaging applications in ICF and HED experiments. Here, we discuss the system architecture and the techniques required for tuning the instruments to achieve optimal performance. Characterization results are also presented along with planned future improvements to the design.
1119	Adsorption and structure of benzene confined in disordered porous carbons: Effect of pore heterogeneity and surface chemistry	Molecular simulations are used to study the adsorption and structure of benzene at 300 K in atomistic models of disordered nanoporous carbons. These disordered carbon models reproduce the morphological (pore shape) and topological (pore connectivity) features present in real nanoporous carbons. Three carbon models, which differ in density and chemical compositions, are used in this study. These carbon models are named as CS400, CS1000 and CS1000a. The adsorption process differs for the three carbon models, which shows that the adsorption phenomena depends upon the local structure of nanoporous carbons. To understand the effect of surface chemistry on adsorption and structure of confined benzene, functional groups (-COOH and -C=O) were added to these carbon models. It was found that the addition of functional groups shifts the pore size distribution (PSD) to smaller values. The presence of functional groups led to the onset of adsorption process at a low pressure. The carboxyl groups (-COOH) have a greater impact on adsorption as compared to carbonyl (-C=O) groups. The CS1000a models have wide micropores and thus it exhibits a jump in adsorption isotherm. The jump shifts towards lower pressure on the addition of functional groups, with -COOH groups showing a larger shift. The presence of functional groups also increases the isosteric heat of adsorption, with -COOH groups showing higher values. The coulombic contribution to total fluid-wall interaction energy is higher for -COOH functional groups and the coulombic contribution decreases on increasing pressure. The structure of benzene confined in CS1000a models exhibit a liquid-like structure, very close to its bulk counterpart.
1120	Simultaneous spin-based Boolean logic operations with re-programmable functionality	Construction of parallel logic gates at nano-scale level<br />undoubtedly improves the efficiency of computable operations.

1121	A novel solar collector for desalination using alumina nanoparticles dispersed paraffin wax	This work aims to study the performance of novel solar collector (square pyramid solar distiller) using alumina nanoparticles dispersed paraffin wax. Three types of square pyramid solar distillers were fabricated to study the effects of PCM (paraffin wax) and alumina nanoparticles on the productivity of distillers. Distiller 1 is conventional type, distiller 2 is a conventional type filled with paraffin wax and distiller 3 is a conventional type filled with alumina nanoparticles (Al2O3) dispersed paraffin wax. The daily productivity of distiller 2 was improved to 4 l/m2 which is 25% higher than distiller 1. This is due to the presence of paraffin wax which stored the thermal energy during daytime and released during night time. The productivity of distiller 3 was improved to 5.02 l/m2 which is 57% higher than distiller 1 and this happened due to the presence of nanoparticles in paraffin wax which further improved the thermal energy holding capacity of the wax and increased the productivity. In addition, the solar distiller efficiency of distiller 2 & 3 was improved to 51 & 65% respectively compared to distiller 1 due to the improvement of the daily productivity of distillers by paraffin wax and alumina nanoparticles.
1122	Multi-phase carbonaceous coating with super wear resistance	Pure amorphous carbonaceous coatings were normally composed of single or dual phases, which inhibit the ultimate performance as potential candidates for tribological protection. This work achieved the pure multi-phase carbonaceous coating matrix by magnetron sputtering technique with pulse bias voltage. Raman analysis indicated the as-fabricated carbon coating was significantly composed of sp<sup>2</sup> bonds and curved graphite-like rings. TEM analyses demonstrated that three kinds of phases including amorphous, fullerene-like and nano-crystalline carbons were interleaved inside the coating matrix with similar fine size around 6 nm. Most of the ordered fullerene-like and nano-crystalline carbon phases were spherical, while, the disordered amorphous carbon phases distributed among ordered carbon phases with irregular shapes. The synergy of these phases generated rather low friction coefficient 0.05 and extremely low wear rate 8.23&times;10<sup>-17</sup>m<sup>3</sup>N<sup>-1</sup>m<sup>-1</sup> under dry-sliding condition in ambient air. The super-wear-resistant multi-phase carbon matrix is great potential to be used as the wear-resistance working surface for mechanical moving components when the liquid lubricant is lacking or forbidden.
1123	Thermal theory of aluminum particle ignition in continuum, free-molecular, and transition heat transfer regimes.	Most studies on nano- and micro- sized aluminum particle ignition have been focused on the processes occuring inside particles.  In the current paper, thermal ignition of an aluminum particle in the air is simulated with different heat transfer models: continuum, free-molecular and Fuchs model.  A single parabolic oxidation law is assumed in the particle size range from nano- to millimeter diameters. A particle is considered ignited when it reaches the oxide melting point.  The criterion defining the limits of validity for each model is the ratio of continuum and free-molecular heat transfer rates. The dependence of ignition temperature $T_i$ on particle size is in a qualitative agreement with the experimental trends: $T_i$ can have values in the range 700--1500 K for nanoparticles due to the dominating contribution of a free-molecular heat transfer, and sharp growth of $T_i$ with the particle size in the range of 1-100  $\mu$m diameter is due to the transitional character of heat transfer. For small values of accommodation coefficient, ignition may occur in the critical ignition mode with the thermal runaway. The results suggest the importance of non-continuous heat transfer and, in particular, energy accommodation in ignition of nano- and micro- sized particles.
1124	<strong>Copper Nanoparticles with Near-unity, Omnidirectional, and Broadband Optical Absorption for Highly Efficient Solar Steam Generation</strong>	The solar steam generation provides a renewable and environment-friendly approach to solve the water shortage issue. The pursuit of efficient, stable, and cheap photothermal agents is thus of great significance. In this work, Cu nanoparticles (NPs) fabricated by simply substitution reaction exhibit a near-unity (&sim;97.7%) light absorption covering a broad incident angle and wavelength range (200-1300 nm). Thus, a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 93% is achieved. The excellent photothermal performance offers unique opportunity for the development of solar steam generation. By coating the Cu NPs on a cellulose membrane, a solar steam generation efficiency of 46.74% is acquired at low irradiation power density of 2 kW m<sup>-2</sup>. Moreover, the Cu NPs are recyclable with the high stability resisting to heat, photoirradiation and corrosion of brine.
1125	<strong>Laser induced graphitization of boron carbide in air</strong>	Raman is a powerful and convenient technique to routinely characterize and distinguish the composition of Boron Carbide (B<sub>4</sub>C), particularly since a wide variation in C content is possible in B<sub>4</sub>C. Graphitization of 1-3&micro;m icosahedral B<sub>4</sub>C powder is observed at ambient conditions under illumination by a 473nm (2.62eV) laser during micro-Raman measurements. The graphitization, with ~12nm grain size, is dependent on the illumination intensity. The process is attributed to the oxidation of B<sub>4</sub>C to B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> by water vapor in air, and subsequent evaporation, leaving behind excess carbon. The effectiveness of this process sheds light on amorphization pathways of B<sub>4</sub>C, a critical component of resilient mechanical composites, and also enables a means to thermally produce graphitic contacts on single crystal B<sub>4</sub>C for nanoelectronics.
1126	<strong>Size effects in TiAlNiAu thin film metal systems used to form ohmic contacts to nitride structures</strong>	In this paper, the relation between the geometry of metric space of TiAlNiAu thin film metal system and the geometry of normed functional space of its sheet resistances (functionals), that are elements of the functional space, is investigated in local approximation. The investigation provides a means to describe a lateral size effect that involves a dependency of sheet resistance R<sub>sq</sub> of TiAlNiAu metal film on its lateral linear dimensions (in (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) plane). This dependency is defined by fractal geometry of dendrites, or, more specifically, it is a power-law dependency on fractal dimension <em>D<sub>f</sub></em> value. The revealed relation has a great practical importance both for a precise calculation of thin film metal system <em>R<sub>sq</sub></em> values in designing discreet devices and ICs, and for controlling results at micro- and nanoscale in producing workflow for thin metal films and systems based on them.
1127	<strong>Carrier injection in organic electronics: </strong><strong>Injection hotspot effect beyond barrier reduction effect</strong>	An alternative strategy, making a number of injection hotspots in nanoscale on the electrode surface to reinforce the local electric field, is proposed for achieving efficient carrier injection in organic electronic/optoelectronic devices. The injection hotspot effect can be dominant at the metal/organic contacts with a high carrier injection barrier, when the barrier reduction effect is not applicable. In the present case, a tiny amount of fullerene and its derivative on ITO do not significantly change the injection barrier, but form the injection hotspots which enhance the electron injection and greatly reduce the operation voltage in the inverted organic light-emitting diodes.
1128	Electrolyte Gated Oxide Pseudo-Diode for Inhibitory Synapse Application with Low Energy Dissipation	Recently, synaptic electronics are attracting increasing attentions in neuromorphic engineering. Here, inhibitory synapses are proposed based on nanogranular phosphorous silicate glass gated indium tin oxide transistors operated in pseudo-diode mode. Activity dependent inhibitory synaptic behaviors are mimicked on the proposed pseudo-diode, including paired pulse depression and depression adaptation behaviors. Interestingly, the proposed inhibitory synapse demonstrates low power dissipation as low as ~16fJ for triggering a post-synaptic current with high signal to noise ratio of ~2.2. Moreover, the inhibitory synapse demonstrates zero resting power dissipation. The proposed pseudo-diode based inhibitory artificial synapses may find potential applications in neuromorphic platforms.
1129	A novel surface area-to-volume ratio estimation technique for nanohemisphere contacted Schottky barrier structures	Nanostructured metal-semiconductor interfaces, also known as Schottky barriers, exhibit remarkable electronic properties. The surface morphology of nanostructure contacted Schottky barriers has a significant effect on its current-voltage (<em>I-V</em>) characteristics, which is crucial for high-performance device applications. In this work, we present a surface area to volume ratio (<em>SVR</em>) estimation technique for nanohemisphere Schottky interfaces. By applying Gauss&rsquo;s law, i.e. without deviating from first principle, we expand the formulation of thermionic emission theory to incorporate surface area and volume. The proposed technique has been assessed by comparison against AFM measured surface characteristics of fabricated Pt/ZnO nanohemisphere structures. Results show that the proposed technique has a high accuracy to within several percent from surface measurements. This technique provides access to <em>SVR</em> while eliminating the need for direct surface characterization, which can be an instrumental tool for the design and analysis of surface-sensitive devices, such as sensors.
1130	Paper based Microfluidic Device for diagnosis of Osteoporosis markers	The present work focuses on the development of a microfluidic paper-based analytical device for the early stage diagnosis of osteoporosis by measuring three important bone biomarkers frequently recommended for the patients being assessed- Calcium, Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) and Vitamin D. The device, fabricated by patterning Chromatography paper using photolithography, consists of a sample zone and three test zones for each of the assay parameters. Serum calcium is measured by O-Cresolphthalein Complexone method, Alkaline phosphatase by BCIP/NBT (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium) substrate system and Vitamin D by a gold nanoparticle - antibody conjugate system, along with a silver staining method for signal amplification, all of which produce a colorimetric reaction. The images of the device are captured using a smartphone and the intensity of colour is measured and compared with a pre-calculated calibration curve to give a quantitative analysis of the assay parameters. This device can be potentially developed into a point-of-care diagnostic device for resource-poor settings as it offers the advantages of being inexpensive, easy to handle and equipment-free.
1131	Measurement of Water Vapor Diffusion in Nanoscale Polymer Films by Frequency-Domain Probe Beam Deflection	We developed an optical pump-probe technique, frequency-domain probe beam deflection (FD-PBD), to measure the diffusion of water vapor in nanoscale polymer films with microsecond temporal resolution and micrometer spatial resolution. We describe the quantitative model of beam deflection for multilayer structures, the experimental approach, and the application of FD-PBD to measure the diffusivity (Dm) of saturated water vapor in various glassy polymer films including polyimide (PI, Dm=7.0x10-13 m2 s-1), Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, Dm= 1.2x10-12 m2 s-1), poly-(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, Dm= 1.7 x10-12 m2 s-1) and cellulose acetate (CA, Dm=2.6 x10-11 m2 s-1),  and  the piperazine/ trimesoyl chloride (PIP/TMC, Dm=9x10-11 m2 s-1) nanofiltration membrane synthesized by interfacial polymerization. The uncertainty of the measurements is typically  &#x2248; 8%.
1132	<strong>Analysis of surface-loaded problem of nonhomogeneous elastic half-plane with surface tension</strong>	Based on the surface elasticity theory, we investigate the effect of surface tension on miniaturized contact problems of an elastic graded half-plane under plane strain and axisymmetric situations. The Fourier sine and cosine transform method is used to derive the solution for the problem under uniform pressure. The results show some interesting features in the distribution of surface elastic fields, which are different from their homogeneous counterparts. The surface Green&rsquo;s functions of the nonhomogeneous half-plane are finally obtained which are verified using finite element method. The outcome of this study provides us not only as a potential method for precise nanoindentation-based analysis of elastic graded materials, but also as the investigations of surface effect-induced failure in nanomaterials and nano-devices.
1133	<strong><strong>Ultra-short-pulsed laser-matter interaction in dielectrics: </strong> <strong>Electron-lattice energy transfer time</strong></strong>	This paper associates the characteristic time of electron-lattice energy transfer in laser-excited dielectrics with the total energy released to the crystal lattice including: (i) the photo-ionization energy equivalent to the band gap energy (<em>E<sub>G</sub></em>), (ii) initial kinetic energy of generated free electrons and (iii) additional energy fed to these electrons by laser pulse via the mechanism of inverse bremsstrahlung. This time represents a benchmark at which many laser-matter interactions and advanced laser applications controlled by the distribution and energy of photo-excited free electrons shift under control of the relaxation-induced temperature distribution in crystal lattice: the phase-matching of interacting laser waves in nonlinear  optical crystals, laser-induced breakdown and damage in optical elements of the advanced laser systems, laser-assisted surface modification, ablation and materials processing, laser-induced  phase transitions, micro- and nano-structuring of optical materials. Estimate suggested in the present work gives a transfer time &raquo;1 ps per 1 eV of total energy released to a crystal lattice  at room temperature,  agreeing  well with the experimental data reported for the ultra-short pulsed laser interaction with  a wide range of materials: (i) 1.4&plusmn;0.6 ps for Si (<em>E<sub>G</sub></em>=1.16 eV), (ii) 6.8&plusmn;0.9 ps for diamond  (<em>E<sub>G</sub></em>=5.47 eV)  and (iii) 15 ps for BaF<sub>2  </sub>(<em>E<sub>G</sub></em>=11 eV).
1134	Oxidation-induced negative Poisson&rsquo;s ratio of phosphorene	Mechanical properties of phosphorene oxides are investigated by using density functional theory calculations. Intriguingly, as the oxygen coverage approaches 50%, negative Poisson&rsquo;s ratios are found in the in-plane principal directions, originating from the asymmetric atomic structure upon oxygen adsorption. It is demonstrated that the structure of phosphorene oxide is largely weakened compared with that of pristine phosphorene. Our work indicates that certain unconventional mechanical properties, such as the negative Poisson&rsquo;s ratio, can be achieved by tuning the atomic structure through simple processes, which offers a new avenue to design specific properties at the nanoscale.
1135	Electronic properties of heterojunction Pb/Pb-Si nanochain devices	Chemical decorated heterojunction Pb/Pb-Si nanochain devices and their electron transport properties are systematically investigated. These Pb-Si nanochain heterostructures are found to show semimetal and graphene-like properties on electronic transport. Particularly, some devices show some excellent performance with large on-off ratios, small sub-threshold swing and high PVR. A link between heterojunction mode and semiconductor-semimetal-metal transformation characteristic has been built. In addition, mutil-NDR effect has been observed on this heterostructure. Moreover, the performance of heterojunction Pb/Pb-Si nanochain devices is observed to be effectively modulated by gate potential. These findings are very valuable for potential implications for the design of high-performance new-generation microelectronic devices.
1136	<strong>Piezoresistive characterization of MWCNT-PEDOT: PSS thin film for strain sensing application</strong>	The piezoresistive properties of thin films based on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) of different concentration dispersed in Poly (3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) polymerized with poly(4-styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) were studied. MWCNTs were synthesized and investigated by the reduction of ethyl alcohol with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) under a strong basic solvent with the high concentration of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The synthesized MWCNTs and PEDOT: PSS nanocomposites were prepared and deposited by the spin coating method on flexible Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymer substrates. The thin films were characterized for their nanostructure and subsequently evaluated for their piezoresistive response. The applied pressure was changed from 0 to 130Pa at speed of 0.2 mm/min. The highest conductivity of the MWCNT-PEDOT: PSS thin film was observed for 0.1 wt% i.e. 13.5 S/m. The highest gauge factor of 22.8 for 0.1 wt% of MWCNTs in PEDOT: PSS matrix on the application of 6% strain was achieved. The fabricated thin film is suitable to develop the flexible electronic-skin, interactive wearable devices and touch screens in strain sensing applications.
1137	Millimeter Wave (220 GHz-330 GHz) Characterizations of Carbon Nanotube Films	A carbon nanotube (CNT) film on a substrate is characterized at millimeter waves (220 GHz&ndash;330 GHz) by metal rectangular waveguide scattering parameters (<em>S</em>-parameters) measurements. The anisotropy of the CNT film is investigated for different orientations of the on-substrate CNT film. The standard Nicolson&ndash;Ross&ndash;Weir (NRW) approach has been adopted to extract the complex permittivity (<em>&epsilon;</em><sub>r</sub>=<em>&epsilon;</em>&prime;-<em>j&epsilon;</em>&Prime;) and permeability (<em>&mu;</em><sub>r</sub>=<em>&mu;</em>&prime;-<em>j&mu;</em>&Prime;) of the on-substrate CNT film from the measured <em>S</em>-parameters. The effective medium theory is then applied to remove the impact of the substrate and characterize the intrinsic CNT film. The observed frequency independent and anisotropic behaviors of the CNT film are very promising indicators that this material could be invaluable for a range of millimeter-wave applications.
1138	<strong>Robust laser-structured asymmetrical PTFE mesh for underwater directional transportation and continuous collection of gas bubbles</strong>	We report a simple, efficient method to fabricate micro/nanoscale hierarchical structures on one side of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) mesh surfaces, using one-step femtosecond laser direct writing technology. The laser-treated surface exhibits superhydrophobicity in air and superaerophilicity in water, resulting in the mesh possesses the hydrophobic/superhydrophobic asymmetrical property. Bubbles can pass through the mesh from the untreated side to the laser-treated side, but cannot pass through the mesh in the opposite direction. The asymmetrical mesh can therefore be designed for the directional transportation and continuous collection of gas bubbles in aqueous environments. Furthermore, the asymmetrical mesh shows excellent stability during corrosion and abrasion tests. These findings may provide an efficient route for fabricating a durable asymmetrical mesh for the directional and continuous transport of gas bubbles.
1139	<strong>Effect of size and shape on the excitonic lasing process in ZnO microstructures</strong>	We investigate the emission properties of various ZnO microstructures with different size and shape in the temperature region from 3 to 300 K using a nanosecond pulsed laser as an excitation source. Room temperature stimulated emission is observed only from the sphere-like ZnO particles with size of a few micrometers. It is probable that individual particles serve as effective resonators with positive energy feedback. Temperature dependent measurements reveal that the mechanism of optical gain at temperatures below ~150 K is the exciton-exciton scattering, whereas at temperatures from ~150 K to room temperature the gain results from the exciton-electron scattering without any contribution from electron-hole plasma lasing. The observed temperature-induced transition between exciton-exciton and exciton-electron scattering is similar to the one reported recently for the micrometer-thick ZnO film [R. Matsuzaki <em>et al. </em>Phys. Rev. B 96, 125306 (2017).]. Thus, the excitonic lasing along with its temperature dependence is common in micrometer-sized ZnO crystals with appropriate optical feedback.
1140	<strong>Fabrication and characteristics of nano-bridge Josephson junctions based on Fe<sub>0.94</sub>Te<sub>0.45</sub>Se<sub>0.55</sub> thin film</strong>	In this paper we have fabricated the nano-bridge Josephson junction on Fe<sub>0.94</sub>Te<sub>0.45</sub>Se<sub>0.55 </sub>thin film by using a focused ion beam etching. We investigate the Josephson effect of this nano-bridge. The current&ndash;voltage characteristics of junction shows resistively and capacitatively shunted junction-like behaviors. The critical current is 16.1 mA at 4.2 K. The product of the critical current and normal state resistance (<em>I</em><sub>c</sub><em>R</em><sub>n</sub>) exhibits high value. The thermal conductance of the nano-bridge increases with the resistance value increasing, indicating enhancement of thermal transfer. The noise equivalent power value of the nanobridge is comparable to NbN bolometer, which is on the order of 10<sup>-12</sup>WHz<sup>-1/2</sup>. This nano-bridge has the potential for the bolometer device.
1141	Numerical simulation of Buongiorno's relation for 3D unsteady flow of Carreau fluid by considering magneto nanoparticles with variable properties	Nanofluids preserve notable consideration that have engrossed numerous examiners owing to their utilization in the arena of nanoscience and nanotechnology. A mathematical relation is established for 3D flow of a magneto-Carreau nanoliquid influenced by a bidirectional stretched surface in this exploration. To visualize the properties of Brownian motion and thermophoresis on the magneto-Carreau nanoliquid the Buongiorno's relation is exploited in a more proficient tactic. Variable thermal conductivity with the possessions of heat source/sink are pondered for heat transfer mechanisms. Suitable conversion is used to change the PDEs into non-linear ODEs. Numerically bvp4c scheme is prompted to crack the resulting ODEs. The discrete behaviors for shear-thinning/thickening of nanoliquid temperature and concentration field are described and deliberated in aspect for somatic parameters. It is exposed that the Carreau liquid temperature declines for advanced magnetic parameter M and conflicting trends is being noted for Brownian N_{b} and thermophoresis parameters N_{t}. Moreover, heat transfer amount diminish for higher Brownian N_{b} and thermophoresis parameters N_{t}. An assessment between two different approaches namely, bvp4c and homotopy analysis method (HAM) is also presented in tabular form in this scrutiny which spectacles that our outcomes is more precise.
1142	Phase transformations in the W-Cr system at the nanoscale	To enhance the thermal stability of nanomaterials, it is important to understand phase transformations at the nanoscale. In this study, the phase transformations in the W-Cr system were investigated using nanometallic multilayers to shift the kinetics of nucleation and increase the diffusivities of W and Cr. The multilayers were tailored to favor the formation of W rich solutions. In addition, the higher diffusivities made it possible to observe the nucleation of W<sub>3</sub>Cr. In this study, the use of nanometallic multilayers is proposed as an approach to modify the thermal evolution of nanocrystalline systems and study phase transformations at the nanoscale.
1143	Preface: Special Topic on Frontiers on THz Photonic Devices	THz photonic devices are now exploiting emerging materials systems, while novel device designs utilise plasmonic effects, nanophotinics and metamaterials.

1144	Coagulation growth kinetics of nanoparticles in dynamic plasma	Coagulation growth kinetics of nanoparticles in plasma is affected by inter-particle electrostatic forces due to charging phenomenon. In stationary plasmas, unipolar charging of particles results in retardation of particles growth and may result in limitation on a particle size. We demonstrate opposite effect that is an enhancement of the particles growth in atmospheric pressure non-stationary arc discharge. Modeling of the growth kinetics revealed the formation of bipolar charge distribution of nanoparticles. As a result, Coulomb forces reversal from repulsive to attractive between nanoparticles promotes enhanced growth rates that allows to form micrometer size particles in a few millisecond time scale.
1145	Appearance of ferromagnetism property for Si nano-polycrystalline body and vanishing of electrical resistances at local high frequencies.	Reduction in the skin effect for the sintered Si nanopolycrystalline body as an electricity conductor at a high frequency due to its nano-structure was studied. Singular vanishing of electrical resistances near a local high magnetic harmonic frequency of a few MHz was observed. This phenomenon has not been observed for conventional ferromagnetic metals. The measured electrical resistances changed to almost 0 mohm at room temperature. At the same time, negative resistance of the sintered Si nano-polycrystalline body was observed. It will be applicable to electronic transmittance lines or semiconductors. Numerical calculation was also performed on the electrical resistance with frequency dependency while considering the electric field and magnetic field in the sintered Si nanopolycrystalline body. The calculation could explain the variation of the relative permittivity of the Si nanopolycrystalline and the phenomenon for vanishing the resistivity at frequency of MHz theoretically. Reduced Si nanoparticles from SiO<sub>2</sub> powder were synthesized by laser ablation in liquid. A Si nano-polycrystalline body made of the reduced Si nanoparticles was fabricated. It was found by measuring the magnetization property of the body that the sintered Si nano-polycrystalline body has ferromagnetism. High-density dangling bonds cause the sintered Si nanopolycrystalline to have ferromagnetism. The density of the unpaired electrons in the sintered Si nanopolycrystalline was also observed using ESR. It has been clarified that the Si nanopowder and the sintered Si nanopolycrystalline have numerous dangling bonds. Both densities of the dangling bonds were evaluated.
1146	Aptamer- based colorimetric determination of Pb2+ using a paper- based microfluidics platform	In this research, a novel paper-based microfluidic aptasensor was designed in order to detect different concentrations of lead in water. The principle based on which this aptasensor works is the interaction of gold nanoparticles with NaCl which leads to a color change from red to purple in the presence of lead ions due to the AuNPs aggregation. Furthermore, two types of filter paper, namely Whatman No.1 and nylon filters were used as the platform of this paper-based microfluidic assay, and the properties of each one was investigated. It was seen that Pb2+ can be detected with linear trends for the calibration of each paper type in concentrations within the 10 nM to 1 mM range in both Whatman No.1 and nylon filter papers. A detection limit of 1.2 nM and 0.7 nM was obtained for Whatman No.1 and nylon filter papers, respectively. Moreover, the Whatman No.1 filter paper was used for the detection in real water sample, which showed a good potential for the detection of Pb2+ in environmental samples.
1147	<strong>Solubility-induced highly crystalline regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) nanorods for field effect transistors</strong>	Manipulation of solubility may favorably impudence the crystallization and orientation of the macroscopic morphology in conducting polymer, which is directly associated to the performance of electronic devices. Here, we used combination of marginal solvent (dichloromethane) and ultrasonication to obtain highly crystalline, oriented and ordered nanorods morphology of regioregular poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) for high performance organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and grazing incidence X- ray diffraction (GIXD) demonstrated highly crystalline nature of spin coated film of P3HT on SiO<sub>2</sub> substrate. Macroscopically ordered and oriented nanorods morphology of P3HT is confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), are used as channel material for OFETs with filed-effect mobility 0.05 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs under ambient conditions. The calculated mobility is 50 fold higher that P3HT film prepared in good solvent (chloroform). The results are further supported by UV-Visible spectroscopy, cyclic volttammetry and theoretical calculation.
1148	<strong>Thermal Percolation in Composite Materials with Electrically Conductive Fillers</strong>	We measured the thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity in the organic/inorganic composites with Ag nanowires (NWs) embedded in the poly(vinylidene fluoride) matrix. High thermal and electrical conductivities are achieved to be  8.43 W/mk and 1.02x10<sup>6</sup> S/m , respectively, when the volume fraction of Ag NWs reaches 28.34% . Both measured electrical and thermal conductivity obey the universal power law commonly described in the percolation theory. The percolation behaviors of thermal and electrical conductivity are clearly observed when the volume fraction of Ag NWs is above the critical volume fraction (2.25%), due to the formation of percolation network. Further calculations on the Lorenz number as a function of Ag NWs volume fraction also confirms the percolation behaviors. The power-law exponent for the thermal percolation is slightly smaller than that for the electrical percolation, which is likely due to the &lsquo;dead-end&rsquo; structures that do not contribute to electrical percolations. To understand the effect of contact resistance between Ag NWs, we modeled the electron contribution to the electrical and thermal resistance at the contact with a simple potential barrier. The non-ideal contact between Ag NWs will cause the interfacial thermal resistance increase much more than the electrical contact resistance. The interfacial Lorenz number will decrease from the Sommerfeld value to a much lower value if the contact is non-ideal. Our work can shed some light on the thermal percolation in composite materials.
1149	<strong>The preparation of Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl@C core-shell nanoparticles with satisfied microstructure and magnetic properties</strong>	Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl@C nanoparticles were prepared by co-precipitation and annealed in a gas mixture. Firstly, the effects of annealing temperature on the structure and magnetic properties of Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl@C nanoparticles were studied. Secondly, the oxidation resistance of Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl@C nanoparticles was explored. When the annealing temperature was 400 <sup>o</sup>C, pure carbon-coated Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl alloy nanoparticles were prepared. With the increasing of annealing temperature, the crystallized degree, grain size and saturation magnetization of Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl@C nanoparticles increased gradually. When the annealing temperature was 800 <sup>o</sup>C, the saturation magnetization of Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl@C nanoparticles reached a maximum value (149.6 emu/g). These Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl@C nanoparticles with good oxidation resistance have great potential in some industrial fields.
1150	Janus nanostructures for heterogeneous photocatalysis	Water treatment, the hydrogen evolution reaction and carbon capture are examples of the potential applications for solar photocatalysis. This has led to significant effort in the search for suitable heterogeneous catalysts. However, materials developed to-date often suffer from disadvantages such as charge recombination, low quantum efficiency, chemical instability and poor economy of production/operation. These factors have made it difficult for the technology to develop beyond laboratory demonstrations. A potential solution to the problem lies with the appropriate design of the catalyst itself, particularly with respect to particle morphology. This review aims to highlight recent efforts directed towards the development and application of an anisotropic, bi-phasic heterodimer, or 'Janus' catalyst. While the topic is in its relative infancy, it has been shown that a Janus morphology can improve catalyst performance by almost an order of magnitude. Hence, a systematic review has been undertaken to highlight and assess recent advances in this field. The review begins with the fundamentals of heterogeneous photocatalysis and proceeds to classify modern catalysts, including Janus particles. This is followed by a detailed description of the relevant studies involving Janus morphology and their demonstrated photocatalytic applications. Finally, an overview of the current challenges and future prospects is discussed along with a summary of the key highlights. It is observed that a Janus morphology can impart several intriguing advantages such as amplification of electric near-field and efficient charge separation. In order to unlock the full potential of Janus photocatalyst, further research in this direction is warranted.
1151	Investigation on the Silver Nanowire/Graphene Transparent Electrode in Electrochromic Device	In this work, we fabricated a flexible silver nanowires (Ag NWs)/graphene transparent conducting film on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate, which was applied in an electrochromic device. The graphene layer was coated on the surface of the Ag NW film utilizing the electrostatic adsorption in order to improve the stability of the metallic nanowire layer and the performance of the electrochromic device. The Ag NW/graphene composite film exhibited an optical transmittance of 82.5% at 550 nm and a sheet resistance of 57.5 &#x03A9;/sq. With the concentration of the adsorbed graphene sheets increased, the transmittance and conductivity of the composite film both decreased. Furthermore, the lifetime of the electrochromic devices based on the tungsten oxide (WO3) thin film and the Ag NW/graphene composite electrodes was greatly extended, compared to that utilizing the pristine Ag NW electrodes. The results indicate that the introduction of the graphene layer could protect the Ag NW film from corrosion of the electrolyte layer, and greatly improve the lifetime and cycle numbers of the electrochromic device.
1152	Nonlinear frequency conversion in one dimensional lithium niobate photonic crystal nanocavities	We demonstrate flexible nonlinear frequency up-conversion in high-Q lithium niobate photonic crystal nanobeam resonators. The high optical Q together with strong optical mode confinement allow us to observe clear second harmonic generation and sum frequency generation with an optical power around only tens of microWatts. These demonstrations show that high-Q lithium niobate photonic crystal nanoresonators are of great promise for nonlinear photonic applications.
1153	<strong>Analytical study of electronic conductance in a lengthy armchair graphene nanoribbon including vacancies, defects or impurities</strong>	<SPAN style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">In this paper, we present an analytic method to study the electronic (magneto-) conductance of a lengthy armchair graphene nanoribbon with a definite width in the presence of some vacancies, defects, impurities or in a small part of it. For this purpose, we employ the Green's function technique within the nearest neighbor tight-binging approach. We first convert the Hamiltonian of an ideal semi-infinite nanoribbon to the Hamiltonian of some independent polyacetylene-like chains. Then, we derive an exact formula for self-energy of perturbed part due to the existence of ideal parts in the nanoribbon. The method gives fully analytically formulation for some cases such as infinite ideal nanoribbon or the one including linear symmetric defects. We calculate transmission coefficient for some different configurations of a nanoribbon with special width including a vacancy, edge geometrical defects and two impurities. An example for a fully analytically solvable case for symmetric linear defect is presented. Finally, the method is used for a nanoribbon including a vacancy when a region around the vacancy is put in a uniform magnetic field.</SPAN>
1154	<strong>Bandgap properties of piezoelectric phononic crystal nanobeam with surface effect</strong>	This paper extends the traditional plane wave expansion (PWE) method to calculate the band structure of proposed piezoelectric phononic crystal (PC) nanobeam with surface effect. The first four orders are chosen to investigate the influence rules of electric field, surface effect and geometric parameters on band gaps. Applied external electric voltage is chosen as the influencing parameter of electric field. Residual surface stress and material intrinsic length are chosen as the influencing parameters of surface effect. Lengths of material PZT-5H and material epoxy in a unit cell, width and thickness of PC nanobeam are picked as the influencing geometric parameters. All the results are expected to be of helpful for the design of piezoelectric nanobeam-based devices.
1155	<strong>Bunching and antibunching in four wave mixing NV center in diamond</strong>	The determination of classical and quantum states through photon bunching and anti-bunching like phenomena may have potential applications in quantum information processing and long-distance quantum communications. We report the photon bunching and multi anti-bunching like phenomena by generating multi-order fluorescence and four wave mixing (FWM) at room temperature using the Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. We have implied four-wave mixing (FWM) process to demonstrate the interference pattern emerging from NV of nano-crystals in both classical, non classical and intermediate(classical and non classical) regimes. Intersystem crossing is controlled by the power of incident beams. The interference pattern from dominant ionization of NV<sup>-</sup> to NV<sup>o</sup> and NV<sup>o</sup> to NV<sup>-</sup> suggests the bunching and anti-bunching like phenomena of photons.
1156	<strong>Thermal conductivity of Si nanowires with &delta;-modulated dopant distribution by self-heated 3&omega; method and its length dependence</strong>	Dopant engineering has been generally adopted to tune the electrical properties of nanostructured materials, whereas their impact to the thermal transport in nanodevices is yet unresolved. Here, we report the thermal conductivity measurement of B-doped Si nanowires with &delta; dopant modulation on the surface using the self-heated 3&omega; method, which resembles the thermal dissipation in operating electronic devices. The thermal conductivity for &delta;-modulated Si nanowire of 45 nm diameter (~23 W/mK) is found to agree well with that of non-doped Si nanowires reported previously, which is attributed to the dominant surface boundary scattering and the highly confined dopant distribution at surface. Further, through a length dependent study of the thermal conductivity (&kappa;) from 400 nm to 4 &micro;m, we found an apparent length dependence of &kappa; at L&lt;2 &micro;m. The phenomenon could not be simply interpreted by solely considering the ballistic effect in thermal transport, but can be accounted by including the additional resistive processes that are associated with the thermalization of joule-heating emitted phonons, which opts in to suppress the thermal conductivity of nano-systems under the ballistic thermal transport regime.
1157	<strong>The temperature-insensitive and significant magnetoresistance observed in Co-doped (La<sub>0.7</sub>Sr<sub>0.3</sub>)MnO<sub>3</sub> with relaxor-like magnetic state</strong>	Ferroelectric relaxor is a type of functional materials that can display temperature-insensitive dielectric constants within a large temperature window, which origins from the sluggish relaxation of nanometer-scale ferroelectric domains. Inspired by this ideal, we intentionally doped different amounts (0.025-0.1) of paramagnetic/low-spin Co<sup>3+</sup>/Co<sup>2+</sup>species into epitaxial (La<sub>0.7</sub>Sr<sub>0.3</sub>)MnO<sub>3</sub> thin films. The evolution of electrical, magnetic, magneto-transport, and valence state of this series of Co-doped (La<sub>0.7</sub>Sr<sub>0.3</sub>)MnO<sub>3</sub> have been systematically characterized. Remarkably, the magnetoresistance in 0.1Co-doped (La<sub>0.7</sub>Sr<sub>0.3</sub>)MnO<sub>3 </sub>can reach 35% within an extremely large temperature window (from 40 to 200 K). Other Co-doped epitaxial (La<sub>0.7</sub>Sr<sub>0.3</sub>)MnO<sub>3</sub> thin films show similar sharp MR-peaks around Curie temperature as that in (La<sub>0.7</sub>Sr<sub>0.3</sub>)MnO<sub>3</sub> matrix. The temperature-insensitive MR of 0.1Co-doped (La<sub>0.7</sub>Sr<sub>0.3</sub>)MnO<sub>3</sub> may be attributed to relaxor-like magnetic state. Our work demonstrates the engineering of artificial relax-like ferromagnet is an effective way to optimize magneto-resistivity of manganites.
1158	Strain Tunable Phononic Topological Bandgaps in Two-Dimensional Hexagonal Boron Nitride	The field of topological mechanics has recently emerged due to the interest in robustly transporting various types of energy in a flaw and defect-insensitive fashion.  While there have been a significant number of studies based on discovering and proposing topological materials and structures, very few have focused on tuning the resulting topological bandgaps, which is critical because the bandgap frequency is fixed once the structure has been fabricated.  Here, we perform both lattice dynamical calculations and molecular dynamical simulations to investigate strain effects on the phononic topological bandgaps in two-dimensional monolayer hexagonal boron nitride.  Our studies demonstrate that while the topologically protected phononic bandgaps are not closed even for severely deformed hexagonal boron nitride, and are relatively insensitive to uniaxial tension and shear strains, the position of the frequency gap can be efficiently tuned in a wide range through the application of biaxial strains.  Our findings shed light on the tunability of the topological bandgaps in nanomaterials.
1159	Plasmon-induced enhancement of efficiency of solar cells modified by metallic nano-particles: material dependence	We analyze the material dependence of the near-field coupling to band electrons of surface plazmons in metallic nanoparticles deposited on the top of a semiconductor substrate in nano-modified solar cells. Various materials for metal and substrate are considered for comparison upon the Fermi Golden Rule approach to theoretical modeling of plasmon-electron coupling. <br />The material dependence of the plasmon effect in two types of solar cells, multi-crystalline Si and CIGS (copper-indium-gallium-diselenide), modified by various metallic nano-particles is illustrated by experimental data.
1160	<strong>Characteristic oscillation phenomenon after head-on collision of two nanofluid droplets</strong>	One falling liquid droplet impacting with a sessile droplet and then undergoing oscillation is a common phenomenon in both nature and industry. However, to our best knowledge, the head-on collision of two nanofluid drops has not been studied when both the nanoparticle and surfactant exist in the drop. In this work, the characteristics of oscillation after head-on collision of two TiO<sub>2</sub>-water nanofluids drops were investigated experimentally. The effects of impact velocity, drop size and nanoparticle concentration have been considered to understand how they influence the drop spreading, recoiling and rebounding. For the influence of drop size, it shows that in 0% and 0.001% of nanoparticle concentrations, the relative spreading radius of small drop size is higher than that with large size, while it is reverse in 0.01% and 0.1% of nanoparticle mass fractions. Interestingly, it was found that there is an optimal nanoparticles mass fraction of 0.1% for nanofluid droplet where the oscillation head-on collision can be damped much more rapidly than that for nanoparticle-free droplet. A hypothesis considering comprehensive interaction of surfactant redistribution, surfactant gradient and particle initial effect was proposed to explain the observed phenomenon. This work will be of significant reference to various practical applications especially when the drop collision oscillation characteristics are supposed to be under control.
1161	Tailoring spin qubit in a nitrogen-vacancy by a breathing magnetic skyrmion	Spin qubit in a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) of a diamond is a promising integrant of quantum computing for its room temperature stability and long coherent time while magnetic skyrmion is an emerging focus in spintronics for its smaller size and easy tunability as binary information carriers. Here we bridge these two fields and demonstrate that a breathing skyrmion can coherently control the spin qubits in a NV center via dipolar interaction. The typical Rabi oscillation of the spin qubit is identified and the influence of detuning from the resonance frequency is discussed. Our finding provides an alternative route to manipulate quantum qubits with low power consumption and high precession in the nanoscale.
1162	Thickness dependence of superconductivity in single-crystal Ta<sub>4</sub>Pd<sub>3</sub>Te<sub>16</sub> nanoribbons	We present the thickness-dependent electrical properties of mechanically exfoliated single crystal Ta<sub>4</sub>Pd<sub>3</sub>Te<sub>16</sub> nanoribbons. By decreasing the nanoribbon thickness in the range of 500-20 nm, we observed a suppression of superconductivity driven by both the thickness and external magnetic field. In particular, for the thinner nanoribbons with thickness less than 40 nm, there is a non-zero resistance state extending down to low temperature, followed by the loss of superconductivity when the thickness is decreased to the order of coherence length. We found that the theory of thermally activated phase slip can well describe the temperature dependence of the resistance below T<sub>c</sub>. And the disorder-induced enhanced Coulomb interaction with the decrease of thickness is expected to be dominant in the gradual crossover behavior from superconducting to normal or very weakly insulating behavior in the low-dimensional system.
1163	<strong>Micro/nano structures on the surface of titanium by one-step nanosecond laser irradiation without focusing</strong>	This paper represents the method of the one-step nanosecond laser irradiation without focusing to fabricate micro/nano structures on the surface of titanium. The microstructure is formed via the crack growth behavior of titanium, and the nanostructure is formed due to the interference of the laser beam on the surface with certain roughness. With desired parameters, the micro/nano structures show good anti-reflectivity, where the reflectivity is about 10% in the spectrum from 800 to 1800 nm.
1164	Ferromagnetic resonance force microscopy of individual domain wall	We report on ferromagnetic resonance force microscopy (FMRFM) based investigations of the ferromagnetic resonance of a single domain wall (DW) in a V-shaped planar permalloy nanowire (NW) which is bent by 60&deg;. A pronounced resonance associated with the DW is observed at 1.6 GHz. FMRFM imaging at the resonance frequency confirms the localization of the resonant mode in the DW area. The measured spectra and spatial distribution of the resonant signal are in a good agreement with the results of micromagnetic modeling.
1165	A Walnut Inspired Silicon Carbon Composites As Stable Lithium Ions Battery Anodes	The distinct quality of silicon (Si) makes it a natural choice for use as an anode material in rechargeable high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for practical applications. Herein, the Si nanoparticles coated predigest by few-layer graphene (Gra) has been well wrapped into a 3D honeycomb porous carbon (Pc) framework with excellent Si-C tectonism contact and open void by a simple freeze drying strategy assisted with the atmospheric chemical vapor deposition. The walnut type structured Si@Gra@Pc with porous architecture can shorten the ions transfer distance and provide high electrical conductivity for fast ions and electrons transport. The novel 3D structure allows the free expansion of Si during long cycling while preserving stable structural integrity owing to the brawny mechanical strength of Gra and 3D Pc framework. More significantly, it is found that the Si@Gra@Pc composites show excellent rate capability and cycling stability companying no obvious capacity decay even after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1C (1C=3500 mA g-1). The present walnut structured Si@Gra@Pc composites are one of stable Si-based anode materials and an important candidate in the development of next-generation advanced LIBs.
1166	Numerical Simulation of Magnetic Drug Targeting to the Stenosis Vessel Using Fe3O4 Magnetic Nanoparticles Under the E&#xFB00;ect of Magnetic Field of wire	In the present paper, the magnetic drug targeting (MDT) using drug coated Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles to the stenosis region of the vessel was investigated. The Reynolds number was considered to be 100. The problem was solved for various magnetic numbers. Moreover, the e&#xFB00;ect of the location of the wire, as a magnetic source, on the MDT was studied. The governing equations of continuity, momentum and volume fraction were solved by taking into account the e&#xFB00;ects of Kelvin force and Magnetophoresis. Finite volume method is used for discretization of unsteady two-phase &#xFB02;ow equations. Two main phenomena of drug droplet formation as a positive factor and vortices generation were observed as a negative factor in MDT. The results showed that in a speci&#xFB01;c magnetic number, the MDT function could be<br />optimal. Furthermore, if the wire is located in the upstream region of the stenosis, it will have a small positive e&#xFB00;ect on the concentration of the drug in the target tissue.
1167	<strong>Facile microwave oven synthesis and spectroscopic investigation of ceria:graphene nanocomposites: band gap widening and luminescence quenching</strong>	In this work, we discussed about the synthesis and optical properties of pure ceria (nanospheres) and ceria:graphene nanocomposites (nanorice like morphology) by using commercial microwave oven as a cost effective and environmental friendly approach. The influence of graphene on the crystallinity, morphology, band gap energy and luminescence of the synthesized samples was discussed. The average crystallite size obtained by using <em>Scherrer</em> formula of the CeO<sub>2</sub> nanostructures showed a decreasing trend with increasing the graphene loading. The higher graphene loaded ceria clearly depicted the morphology of nanorice like in shape with the diameter below 10 nm and the length over below 50 nm.  The presence of graphene and ceria related vibrational modes (100-4000 cm<sup>-1</sup>) confirmed the successful formation of nanocomposites. The observed increase in band gap (blue shift) with the loading amount of graphene was discussed. Further, the luminescence related to various <em>F</em>-centers and its quenching in the nanocomposites was discussed.
1168	<strong>Study on Thermal Conductivities of Si Thin Films and Porous Si</strong><strong>Structures Based on a New Lattice Boltzmann Method</strong>	In this work, a new type of lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is developed to predict the thermal conductivity of silicon thin films and porous silicon structures, in which model a probability parameter is introduced to determine whether a phonon collision event happens at a specific lattice point. The thickness-dependent silicon-thin-film thermal conductivities calculated using this method show good agreement with prior experimental and simulation results. We also use this approach to study the porosity and pore-size dependence of the thermal conductivity of porous silicon structures. Furthermore, the computed porous silicon thermal conductivities are found to agree well with previously reported data. The new algorithm offers substantial computational improvement as compared to existing LBM models and enables us to understand the thermal transport in various structures of interest at the nanoscale.
1169	Structure transformation by sp2 hydrocarbon assisted carbon nanotube growth	In this study, we investigated the effect of hydrocarbon species composition on carbon nanotube (CNT) growth using an iron catalyst by the chemical vapor deposition. The atomic hydrogen and active carbon species from hydrocarbon affect to the nucleation and growth of CNT arrays. With increasing in atomic hydrogen content, the interface layer distance of the CNTs decreased from 3.7 to 3.4 &#x00C5;. The shifts in the G-band in the Raman spectra of the CNTs indicated that the hydrogen atoms affected the generation of C-C bonds in graphene layers.
1170	<strong>A distributed electrical model for superconducting nanowire single photon detectors</strong>	To analyze the switching dynamics and output performance of a superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD), the nanowire is usually modelled as an inductor in series with a time-varying resistor induced by absorption of a photon. Our recent experimental results show that, due to the effect of kinetic inductance, for a SNSPD made of a nanowire of sufficient length, its geometry length can be comparable to or even longer than the effective wavelength of frequencies contained in the output pulse. In other words, a superconducting nanowire can behave as a distributed transmission line so that the readout pulse depends on the photon detection location and the transmission line properties of the nanowire. Here, we develop a distributed model for a superconducting nanowire and apply it to simulate the output performance of a long nanowire designed into a coplanar waveguide. We compare this coplanar waveguide geometry to a conventional meander nanowire geometry. The simulation results agree well with our experimental observations. With this distributed model, we discussed the importance of microwave design of a nanowire and how impedance matching can affect the output pulse shape. We also discuss how the distributed model affects the growth and decay of the photon-triggered resistive hotspot.
1171	Tunable mechanical and electrical properties of high density polyethylene / multi-walled carbon nanotube nanocomposites determined by a novel rheological approach	Fast and efficient determination of the optimal mechanical properties and prediction of the conductive percolation regions of a polymer/CNT nanocomposite is crucial to develop conductive nanocomposites. This work established a novel rheological approach to evaluate the tunable mechanical and electrical properties of high density polyethylene (HDPE) / multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanocomposites with and without compatibilizer. Results illustrate that three types of nanocomposites exhibit obvious gel plateau in the dynamic rheological curves and the gel points of nanocomposites with compatibilizer shift to the low MWCNTs loading. The gel point of HDPE/MWCNT nanocomposites are correlated with the conductive threshold but not with the super-toughness points of these composites. However, the super-toughness points of HDPE/MWCNT nanocomposites with compatibilizer show the correspondence with the gel points acquired from the rheological data and the gel points are located in the conductive percolation regions, indicating that the dynamic rheology is an effective way to determine the super-toughness points and predict the conductive percolation regions of HDPE/MWCNT nanocomposites with compatibilizer. Furthermore, unique network structure at the gel points is directly observed and the new mechanism of toughness is proposed. This study provides new insights and approach towards effective control of the structures and properties for compound design of polymer/CNT nanocomposites.
1172	<strong>Photoresponse of Nonvolatile Resistive Memory Device</strong><strong> Based on All-Inorganic Perovskite CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> Nanocrystals </strong>	<strong> </strong>In this work, the resistive memory devices were fabricated based on CsPbBr<sub>3 </sub>nanocrystals (NCs) embedded into the insulating polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) with a configuration of Au/PMMA/PMMA:CsPbBr<sub>3 </sub>NCs/PMMA/indium doped tin-oxide (ITO). The devices exhibit nonvolatile multi-level resistive switching and show the distinct photoresponse in different high resistance states (HRS). In HRS with low current, the devices witness the prompt photoresponse under irradiation. And the resistive switching behaviors in another HRS, especially switching voltages, can be affected by the ultraviolet irradiation. Combined with the energy band evolution, the resistive switching and photoresponse of Au/PMMA/PMMA:CsPbBr<sub>3 </sub>NCs/PMMA/ITO devices were elucidated by considering the photosensitive property and role of trapping/de-trapping centers of CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> NCs.
1173	Reversible and magnetically unassisted voltage-driven switching of the magnetization in FeRh/PMN-PT	Minimizing power consumption in spintronic devices requires sizeable and reversible control of magnetization by electric fields without being assisted by subsidiary magnetic field or electric current. Upon increasing temperature, FeRh displays an uncommon antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition linked to a unit cell volume expansion. Thus, using the strain exerted by an adjacent piezoelectric layer, the relative amount of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic regions can be tuned by electric field applied to the piezoelectric material. Indeed, large variation of the saturation magnetization by electric field application have been observed in FeRh films grown on piezoelectric substrates. In view of applications, the variations of the remanent magnetization rather than those of saturation magnetization are most relevant. Here, we show that even in absence of any bias external magnetic field, permanent and reversible magnetization changes as large as 34% can be induced by electric field, which remain after zeroing it. Bulk and local magnetoelectric characterization reveal that the ultimate reason for the observed large magnetoelectric response at remanence is the expansion (rather than the nucleation) of new ferromagnetic nanoregions and that the most efficient magnetic reversal is achieved at ferroelectric domain walls, where local 180<sup>o</sup> switching is observed.
1174	Connectedness percolation of hard convex polygonal rods and platelets	The properties of polymer composites with nanofiller particles change drastically above a critical filler density known as the percolation threshold. Real nanofillers, such as graphene flakes and cellulose nanocrystals, are not idealized disks and rods but are often modeled as such. Here we investigate the effect of the shape of the particle cross section on the geometric percolation threshold. Using connectedness percolation theory and the second-virial approximation, we analytically calculate the percolation threshold of hard convex particles in terms of three single-particle measures. We apply this method to polygonal rods and platelets and find that the universal scaling of the percolation threshold is lowered by decreasing the number of sides of the particle cross section. This is caused by the increase of the surface area to volume ratio with decreasing number of sides.
1175	A theoretical study of the size- and edge-effect cohesive energy and shear strength between graphene, carbon nanotubes and nanofibers	Explicit expressions for the size- and edge-effect cohesive energy and shear stress between two finite-sized graphene (graphene/graphene), two finite-sized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (CNT/CNT) and two finite-sized nanofibers (nanofiber/nanofiber) are obtained through continuum modeling of van der Waals (vdW) interactions between them. The close-form solutions of the cohesive energy and shear stress between these structures at different positions are derived by using Gaussian quadrature. The analytical results of the edge-effect cohesive energy show that both of the maximum repulsive and attractive shear stresses are always close to the initial intersecting positions between them. Checking against present molecular dynamics (MD) calculations and available experimental results shows that the continuum solutions are reasonable, in which the main reason of their difference is also revealed in detail. The obtained analytical solutions should be of great help for understanding the size- and edge-effect interactions between these nanostructures and designing nanoelectronic devices.
1176	Monte Carlo Simulation of Cylinders with Short-Range Attractions	Cylindrical or rod-like particles are promising materials for the applications of fillers in nanocomposite materials and additives to control rheological properties of colloidal suspensions. Recent advances in particle synthesis allows for cylinders to be manufactured with short-ranged attractions to study the gelation as a function of packing fraction, aspect ratio and temperature. In order to aid in the analysis of small-angle scattering experiments of rod-like particles, computer simulation methods were used to model these particles with specialized Monte Carlo algorithms and optimized superquadric potentials. The attractive interaction between neighboring rods increases with the amount of locally-accessible surface area, thus leading to patchy-like interactions. We find that the cylinders form homogenous fluids, clusters, gels or glasses as a function of the attraction strength, volume fraction and aspect ratio. Computer simulations are used to predict the conditions at which the above phases are observed. Comparisons with the experimental scattering results are also presented, which are in agreement.
1177	<strong>Spin readout via spin-to-charge conversion in bulk diamond nitrogen-vacancy ensembles</strong>	We demonstrate optical readout of ensembles of NV center spins in a bulk diamond sample via spin-to-charge conversion. A high power 594 nm laser is utilized to selectively ionize the paramagnetic defects in the <em>m</em><sub>S</sub>=0<sub> </sub>spin state with a contrast of up to 12%. In comparison with the conventional 520 nm spin readout, spin-to-charge-conversion-based readout provides higher signal-to-noise ratio, with tenfold sensing measurement speedup for millisecond long pulse sequences. This level of performance was achieved for an NV<sup>-</sup> ionization of only 25%, limited by the ionization and readout laser powers. These observations pave the way to fast, high-sensitivity nanoscale sensing with ensembles of coherent NV center spins in bulk diamond.
1178	Spin wave modes of two magnetostatic coupled spin transfer torque nano-oscillators	A detailed analytical and numerical study of the spin wave modes  of two nanopillar spin torque nano-oscillators coupled by magnetostatic interactions, is presented under the macrospin approximation. Results show that the normal modes of the system oscillate with the magnetizations in-phase or anti-phase in both disks. The frequencies  and critical current densities necessary to induce auto-oscillations of the spin wave modes of the coupled system depend on the relative position of the nanopillars and the applied magnetic field.  If the oscillators are identical, these modes are degenerate at a certain relative position of the nanopillars, while if the oscillators are non-identical such degeneracy is removed. Then, we can conclude that the magnetostatic coupling between two spin transfer torque nano-oscillators is a powerful mechanism to control the spin wave modes of this system.
1179	In-situ tuning of individual position-controlled nanowire quantum dots vialaser-induced intermixing	We demonstrate an in-situ technique to tune the emission energy of semiconductor quantum dots. The technique is based on laser-induced atomic intermixing applied to nanowire quantum dots grown using a site-selective process that allows for the deterministic tuning of individual emitters. A tuning range of up to 15meV is obtained with a precision limited by the laser exposure time. A distinct saturation of the energy shift is observed, which suggests an intermixing mechanism relying on grown-in defects that are subsequently removed from the semiconductor material during annealing. The ability to tune different emitters into resonance with each other will be required for fabricating remote quantum dot-based sources of  indistinguishable photons for secure quantum networks.
1180	<strong>Two-dimensional (2D) few-layers WS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets: an ideal nanomaterials with tunable electromagnetic absorption performance<sup> </sup></strong>	In this study, few-layers (FL) WS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets were fabricated through liquid phase exfoliation, and the dielectric and electromagnetic absorption (EA) properties were first reported. The results show that a composite consisting of 30 wt% FL-WS<sub>2</sub> exhibited an effective EA bandwidth  of 4.6 GHz at a thickness of 2.5 mm. Meanwhile, the strongest absorption point (RL<sub>str</sub>) can reach &minus;63.0 dB. The most noteworthy is that FL-WS<sub>2 </sub>based composite can completely absorb the electromagnetic energy from X (8-12 GHz) and Ku (12-18 GHz) band. These results indicate that FL-WS<sub>2</sub> has practical application against electromagnetic pollution in the future.
1181	Controlling the electrical conductive network formation in nanorod filled polymer nanocomposites by tuning nanorod stiffness	In this work, by employing a coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, we have investigated the effect of the nanorod (NR) stiffness on the relationship between the NR microstructure and the conductive probability of NR filled polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) under the quiescent state and under the shear field. The conductive probability of PNCs is gradually enhanced with the increase of NR stiffness in the quiescent state; however, it first increases and then decreases under the shear field. Under the shear field, the largest conductive probability appears at the moderate NR stiffness, which results from the competition between the improved effective aspect ratio of NR and the breakage of the conductive network. Meanwhile, compared with in the quiescent state, under the shear field the decrease or the increase of the conductive probability depends on the NR stiffness. At low NR stiffness, the increase of the effective aspect ratio of NR enhances the conductive probability. While at high NR stiffness, the breakage of the conductive network reduces the conductive probability. For flexible NRs, the conductive probability first increases and then decreases with increasing the shear rate. The maximum effective aspect ratio of NRs appears at the moderate shear rate, which is consistent with the conductive probability. In summary, this work presents some further understanding how NR stiffness affects the electric conductive property of PNCs under the shear field.
1182	<strong>Oxygen desorption kinetics of ZnO nanorod&ndash;gated AlGaN/GaN HEMT-based UV photodetectors</strong>	This study investigated the effect of gate length and surface area of the ZnO ultraviolet (UV) absorbing structure on the transient characteristics of AlGaN/GaN HEMT based UV photodetectors. The gate-areas of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs with 2, 6 and 18 &mu;m lengths with same width of 100 &mu;m were covered with ZnO thin film and nanorods (NR). The fabricated devices show enhancement in response speed with the reduction of gate length or the increase of ZnO surface area. The best response speed of ~10 ms response time and ~190 ms recovery time is measured from the NR-gated device with a gate length of 2 &mu;m. A model for the oxygen desorption kinetics is proposed for the first time which theoretically shows that that the response speed is dependent on two key parameters; light absorbing surface area and gate length. From our model analysis, it is shown that predicted response time is a strong function of these two device parameters, and the calculations show a good agreement with the experimental measurements.
1183	Origin of the Elinvar Anomaly in Fe-Ni-Cr Alloy: Strain Glass Transition	We report experimental evidences of a strain glass transition in a commercial Elinvar alloy Ni-Span C, such as frequency dispersion of storage modulus, continuous formation of ferromagnetic BCT structured nanodomains of martensite. Accompanying such a transition, the gradual modulus softening of austenite compensates the smooth modulus hardening due to the vibrational anharmonicity of nanodomains, leading to the temperature-independent elastic modulus over a broad temperature range. Our findings provide new insights into the origin of Elinvar anomaly in Fe-Ni based alloys, and shed light on the research and development of novel Elinvar materials with the principle of strain glass transition.
1184	<strong>Picosecond x-ray radiography of microjets expanding from laser shock-loaded grooves</strong>	Material ejection upon the breakout of a shock wave at a rough surface is a key safety issue for various applications, including pyrotechnics and inertial confinement fusion. For a few years, we have used laser driven compression to investigate microjetting from calibrated grooves in the free surface of shock-loaded specimens. Fast transverse optical shadowgraphy, time-resolved measurements of planar surface and jet tip velocities, and post-shock analysis of some recovered material have provided data over ranges of small spatial and temporal scales, short loading pulses (ns-order) and extremely high strain rates. In the new experiment reported here, picosecond laser irradiation of a thin copper wire generates an ultrashort x-ray burst which is used to radiograph the microjets expanding from plane wedged-shape grooves in tin and copper samples shock-loaded by a longer, nanosecond laser pulse. Such ultrafast radiography provides estimates of the density gradients along the jets and of the total ejected mass at different times after shock breakout. Furthermore, it reveals regions of low density inside the samples deep beneath the grooves, associated to damage due to tension induced by the interaction of rarefaction waves. Thus, combining this x-ray probe with our former experimental techniques provides a more complete insight into the physics of microjetting at very high loading rates and the ballistic properties of the resulting ejecta.
1185	<strong>Nano-scaled Transistor&rsquo;s Performance and Reliability Characterization at Nano-second Regime</strong>	In this work, we developed a novel sub-ns measurement method for reliability behavior characterization of nano-scaled transistors. The experimental results show that, due to the severe self-heating effect (SHE) and interfacial defect trapping in the device, the I-V measurement speed could significantly affect the characterization results of the nanoscale transistor including its threshold voltage shift (<em>V</em><sub>TH</sub>) and saturation drive current (<em>I</em><sub>DSAT</sub>) degradation. Due to the inevitable SHE and interfacial defect in the transistor channel caused by the long measurement time, the <em>V</em><sub>TH</sub> shift and <em>I</em><sub>DSAT</sub> degradation would be misestimated, leading to an overestimation of the HCI and PBTI lifetime.
1186	Atmospheric discharge plasma chemistry in aqueous solution: Importance of the generation of water vapor bubbles for the plasma onset and its evolution	Discharge plasma formed in aqueous solution has attracted much attention for the application to environmental purification and material syntheses. Discharge in water under atmospheric pressure produces abundant hydroxyl and hydrogen radicals, acting as a strong oxidizing and reducing species, respectively. Here, the onset and the evolution of discharge plasma and those transient reactive species in the aqueous solution are successfully monitored with micrometer spatial resolution and nanosecond temporal one. Combination of custom-made microscopic discharge system and high-speed camera provides direct evidence that the preceding formation of the water vapor bubble by the thermal phase transition at the tip of the electrode and its connection to the other one play crucial roles to ignite and sustain the plasma in water. It is also found that the firstly ignited plasma only lasts for sub-100 ns and quenches rapidly but regenerates in the water vapor bubble. These two distinct generation and successive steps, i.e. the ignition plasma (IP) and following successive plasma (SP) correspond to dielectric breakdown and glow-like plasmas, respectively. By time-resolved micro-spectroscopic imaging approaches, the difference in the spatial distributions between hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals at the initial stage of the plasma formation was also detected. These results provide a direct evidence for the proposed mechanism for plasma evolution in water and important information for the efficient control of the discharge plasma to its applications to waste-water treatments, nanomaterial syntheses with plasma oxidation-reduction reactions, and the chemical modification of the materials surfaces in aqueous solutions with green-chemistry manner.
1187	Luminescence of atomic barium in rare gas matrices - a 2D-Excitation/emission spectroscopy study	A detailed characterisation of the distinct sites occupied by atomic barium isolated in the three rare gas hosts Ar, Kr and Xe is made with excitation scans extracted from the recorded total 6s6p 1P1 &#xF0AE; (6s)2 1S0 fluorescence.  Extensive use has been made of two dimensional excitation-emission (2D-EE) spectroscopy to achieve a comprehensive characterisation for the wide variety of sites present in the Ba/RG matrix systems.  The 2D-EE technique has proved to be a very powerful method to probe the effects of strong inter-site reabsorption when extensive spectral overlap occurs between emission and resonance 6s6p 1P1 &#x2190; (6s)2 1S0 absorption of barium atoms occupying multiple sites.  2D-EE scans have also been used in this study to monitor the effects of sample annealing and thereby identify the thermally stable sites of isolation.  Sites of the same type occupied by atomic barium in the three host solids are identified in resolved excitation spectra and are associated on the basis of the observed matrix-shift versus host polarisablity.  Following site associations, the photophysical properties of each matrix site were characterised revealing that the Stokes shift was greatest in the blue site, smallest for the violet and intermediate for the green site.  Emission temperature dependences and excited state lifetimes were recorded indicating that measured radiative lifetimes of 4-5 ns were in good agreement with the gas phase value of 8.4 ns when corrected for the effective field of the solids.  The only exception to this was the blue site in Ba/Xe where a non-radiative quenching channel exists even at 9.8 K that competes effectively with the nanosecond fluorescence.  An unusual, asymmetric 2+1 excitation band has been recorded for atomic barium in the three rare gas hosts in addition to the 3-fold split, Jahn-Teller bands typically observed for P &#x2190; S absorptions of matrix-isolated metal atoms. Possible assignments of the sites responsible for the Ba/RG bandshapes are made on the basis of recent Ba/Xe spectral simulations [J. Chem. Phys., 148, 124308 (2018)] obtained from molecular dynamics calculations.
1188	<strong>Electrical </strong><strong>nucleation and detection of single 360&deg; N&eacute;el domain walls measured using the </strong><strong>anomalous Nernst effect</strong>	<strong>We demonstrate electrically the </strong><strong>nucleation and detection of a single 360&deg; N&eacute;el domain wall (DW), formed by an independently nucleated pair of 180&deg; N&eacute;el DWs having the same helicity in a </strong><strong>perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) </strong><strong>track. The domain wall formation is governed by strong interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and detected at room temperature using the </strong><strong>anomalous Nernst effect (ANE)</strong><strong>. A large DMI can be generated at the interface, which breaks the symmetry between a material having a large spin-orbit coupling and a thin ferromagnetic layer. </strong><strong>The ANE voltage, </strong><strong><em>V</em></strong><strong><sub>ANE </sub></strong><strong>&prop;</strong> <strong>&nabla;</strong><strong><em>T</em></strong><strong>&times;</strong><strong><em>M</em></strong><strong>, is sensitive to the magnitude of out-of-plane magnetization <em>M</em> through a confined thermal in-plane temperature gradient </strong><strong>&nabla;</strong><strong><em>T </em></strong><strong>and </strong><strong>allows for the direct thermo-electrical detection of the DW position with nanoscale accuracy along the track</strong><strong>. Here </strong><strong>we present evidence that independently nucleated pairs of 180&deg; N&eacute;el DWs in microwire devices can be pushed together by an applied magnetic field to form a 360&deg; N&eacute;el DW, and that a</strong><strong> strong magnetic field</strong> <strong>needs to be applied in order to annihilate the </strong><strong>360</strong><strong>&deg;</strong> <strong>DW</strong><strong> due to a strong interfacial DMI in our </strong><strong>Pt/Co/AlO<sub>x</sub> multilayers</strong><strong>. In addition to enabling a high magnetic storage and data transfer rate with low power consumption in novel computational and storage devices, such DWs facilitate a reduction in bit size down </strong><strong>to a few nanometer</strong><strong>s with metastability.</strong>
1189	Light-Induced Magnetization Changes in Aggregated and Isolated Cobalt Ferrite Nanoparticles	The light-induced magnetization changes in cobalt ferrite nanoparticles are reinvestigated to probe the mechanism of photomagnetic behavior and to uncover the essential criteria required to observe the effect.  Irradiation with white light results in pronounced demagnetization as evidenced by a decrease in the coercivity (&Delta;Hc &sim; 3 kOe at 10 K) and a drop in the high field magnetization at 70 kOe.  Wavelength dependent studies show the optical excitation driving the effect is broad in nature.  Power and temperature (<em>T</em>) dependent measurements reveal strikingly different photomagnetic behavior for the high field magnetization and coercive fields with energy scales of 25 K and 200 K, respectively.  Importantly, the magnitude of the light-induced change in the magnetization is found to be specific to the synthetic protocol, with aggregated nanoparticles showing a larger effect than isolated particles.  M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy provides additional evidence of the differences between the aggregated and isolated nanoparticle samples.  For T &le; 25 K, the photo-response arises from magnetic disorder generated by an elevated electronic temperature in the surface layer of the particles, thereby leading to a decrease in magnetic volume.  For 25 K &le; <em>T</em> &le; 200 K, the electronic and phononic reservoirs are more intimately coupled, so the photo-induced magnetic response follows the temperature dependence of the magneto-crystalline anisotropy.  A similar response in manganese ferrite suggests the mechanism is general.
1190	Protein Encapsulation via Polyelectrolyte Complex Coacervation: Protection against Protein Denaturation	Complex coacervation can be used as a route to compartmentalize a variety of solutes such as organic small molecules, inorganic nanoparticles as well as proteins within microscale coacervate droplets. To obtain insight into the accumulation of proteins within complex coacervate phases, the encapsulation of BSA within complex coacervates containing cationic polyelectrolyte poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and anionic polyelectrolyte poly (acrylic aid) (PAA) was investigated as a function of mixing sequence, total polyelectrolyte concentration, BSA overall concentration, as well as the mixing molar ratio of PAA/PAH. Mixing BSA having a negative net charge with the polycation PAH before coacervation, increasing the total polyelectrolyte concentration and PAA/PAH molar ratio, or decreasing the BSA overall concentration led to more efficient protein encapsulation. Preservation of secondary structure of BSA during the complex coacervation process was confirmed using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Our study shows that PAA-PAH coacervates can serve as protective system against the denaturation of BSA when exposed to extremes of pH, high temperatures, as well as in solution of urea. Additionally, it was found that by encapsulation of protein within coacervates via complex coacervation, the complexation between protein and heavy metal can be efficiently inhibited. Protection of BSA against severe environmental conditions via encapsulation within polyelectrolyte coacervates provides new insights and methods to issues of maintaining stability and function of proteins.
1191	Nonlinear Constitutive Models for Nano-scale Heat Conduction	We present a rigorous approach that leads, from a many-particle description, to a nonlinear, stochastic constitutive relation for the modeling of transient heat conduction processes at nanoscale. By enforcing statistical consistency, in that the statistics of the local energy is consistent<br />with that from an all-atom description, we identify the driving force as well as the model parameters.
1192	<strong><em>Modeling photothermal induced bistability in vanadium dioxide/1D photonic crystal composite nanostructures </em></strong>	We theoretically investigate the absorption bistability behavior of a nanostructure consisting of a vanadium dioxide (VO2) layer grown on top of a one-dimensional photonic crystal. The proposed structure is illuminated by a continuous wave pump laser, resulting in heat generation within the VO2 layer, and a subsequent phase transition which drastically affects the optical response of the nanostructure. We solve a multiphysics problem containing electromagnetism and thermodynamics in order to show that the optically induced transitions in the VO2 layer can lead to a bistable response in the nanostructure over some ranges of incident intensities during the VO2 heating and cooling modes. Interestingly, when the laser is well set up in an appropriate wavelength, the high contrast of two absorption values in the hysteresis loop indicate bistability and the possibility of achieving near-unity absorption. These properties give our structure promise for designing tunable VO2-based absorbers and optical switching devices.
1193	Theoretical prediction electronic properties of Group-IV diamond nanothreads	We have investigated the atomic and electronic structures, and carrier mobility on Group-IV diamond nanothreads (DNTs-C, DNTs-SiC, DNTs-Si and DNTs-Ge) using density functional theory. It is shown that all of Group-IV diamond nanothreads are wide gap semiconductors(&gt;3eV). The highest electron (hole) mobility value is even up to ~1.15&times;10<sup>5</sup> (1.38&times;10<sup>3</sup>)cm<sup>2</sup>V<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. Due to the huge difference mobility in hole and electron, DNTs-Si and DNTs-Ge can be considered as <em>p</em>-type semiconductors, and DNTs-C can be considered as <em>n</em>-type semiconductor. Our results suggest that Group-IV diamond nanothreads can be considered as a new material for applications optoelectronics and nanoelectronic devices in some special conditions, such as high- temperature devices, wide-gap semiconductors, transparent conductors and so on.
1194	<strong>Epitaxial GaAs and pHEMT on &ldquo;aluminum&rdquo; nanofilms</strong>	Heterogeneous epitaxial growth between semiconductors and metals boosts novel device development and enables various applications. In this work, we have investigated the epitaxial growth of GaAs layers on top of a nanoscale aluminum film. The grown GaAs layers are single-crystalline and of high-quality, that has been evidenced by using various material characterization methods and by fabricating their high-electron mobility transistors. We found that an intriguing process named as &ldquo;arsenidation&rdquo; of aluminium film plays a key role in the successful epitaxy. Our work opens a window for growing semiconductor/metal hetero-structures for various device applications in the future.
1195	Pattern quality and defect evaluation based on cross correlation and power spectral density methods	Precise detection of a nanometer-scale pattern's edge positions in a SEM image is challenging for next generation patterning technology development. Here we propose two different edge detection methods, one is based on a normal method employing the edge threshold algorithm and the other is based on a cross-correlation method by calculating the real image with a reference. By using different SEM images without noise and with noise, we summarize the pros and cons of the abovementioned two methods. With the implementation of the power spectral density method, the comparison shows that the cross-correlation method suppresses the metrology uncertainty of edge positions and edge roughness. Besides, cross-correlation method also calculates all potential edge defects, especially the footing defects and the top loss defects. The method has high application potential in 3D reconstruction process by using different reference waves, in addition to that it enables novel FEM metrology such as the roughness FEM and defect FEM.
1196	<strong>  Molecular dynamics study of copper nanosprings with/withou twin boundary structures</strong>	Using molecular dynamics simulation, we extract the deformation mechanism in Cu nanosprings with/without nanotwinned structures for the superior elongation. The dislocation-driven deformation mechanism in nanosprings is found, which mainly depends on the geometry of nanosprings. Severe distortion caused by local dislocation emission is frequently observed at the plastic stage, especially for nanosprings with large wire diameters. It is proved that small twin boundary spacings can improve the mechanical behaviors of nanosprings by limiting the dislocation emission and twin boundary migration. By calculating the spring constant of nanosprings with/without twin boundary structures, we find that the stiffness of nanosprings with larger wire diameters, smaller helix pitches or smaller twin boundary spacings would become larger, and the classical theory is still valid in nanosprings.
1197	Shaping single atomic junctions in ultra-thin Ag structures by electromigration	Electromigration, originally thought of only as a detrimental effect for metallic nanostructures, is <br />demonstrated here as a useful structuring tool to form reproducibly atomic point contacts in ultrathin (5 nm) and ultra-small (minimum width 16 nm) Ag nanostructures deposited on hydrogen <br />terminated low-doped Si(100) samples. Single contacts were always obtained once the smallest <br />width of the structures was below the average grain size of the Ag films and competing thermal <br />migration was suppressed. These ultra-thin and laterally open structures on Si provide complete <br />accessibility for local characterisation of the molecular junction.
1198	Ion size effect on electrostatic and electroosmotic properties in soft nanochannels with pH-dependent charge density	We report a theoretical study of ion size effect on various properties in a soft nanochannel with pH-dependent charge density. We develop a free energy based mean-field theory taking into account ion size as well as pH-dependence of charged polyelectrolyte layer grafted on a rigid surface in an electrolyte. The influence of ion size on properties in a soft nanochannel is evaluated by numerically calculating ion number densities and electrostatic potential. We demonstrate that unlike in point-like ions, for finite sizes of ions, a uniform distribution of chargeable sites within the polyelectrolyte layer causes unphysical discontinuities in ion number densities not only for hydrogen ion but also for other kinds of ions. It is shown that the same cubic spatial distribution of chargeable sites as for point-like ions is necessary to ensure continuity of ion number density and zero ion transport at the polyelectrolyte layer - rigid solid interface. We find that considering finite ion size causes an increase in electrostatic potential and electroosmotic velocity and a decrease in ion number densities. More importantly, we demonstrate that in polyelectrolyte layer, pH-dependence of polyelectrolyte charge density makes accumulation of hydrogen ions stronger than for the other positive ion species in the electrolyte and such a tendency is further enhanced by considering finite ion size. In addition, we discuss how consideration of finite ion size affects the role of various parameters on electrostatic and electroosmotic properties.
1199	Numerical and experimental investigation of 4 mm wavelength microwave oscillator based on high-current compact accelerator	The concept of two-wave relativistic Cherenkov oscillator for generation of nanosecond micro-wave pulses at ~72 GHz central frequency has been applied. Moderately oversized sectioned slow wave structure (average diameter &#x2248; 2.5 wavelength) provides interaction of electrons sim-ultaneously with slow (or surface) TM01 wave and the fast (or volume) TM02 wave, which gov-erns the microwave energy output. The generation of 85 MW, 1.3-ns long microwave pulses has been demonstrated in a single pulse operation with a pulsed guiding magnetic field of 3.8 T on the base of desktop high-current accelerator RADAN-303.
1200	<strong>Polyallylamine hydrochloride coating enhances the fluorescence emission of Human Serum Albumin encapsulated gold nanoclusters</strong>	<strong>A method of increasing the fluorescence emission of Human Serum Albumin (HSA) encapsulated gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) via a Polyallylamide hydrochloride (PAH) coating. PAH molecules with a molecular weight of ~17,500 Da can enhance the fluorescence emission of HSA-AuNCs by 3-fold when the protein/polymer concentration ratio is 2:1 in solution. AuNCs fluorescence lifetime decreases while native tryptophan (TRP) fluorescence lifetime decreases during enhancement. The zeta potential of the system was observed to be zero during maximum enhancement causing the formation of large aggregates. This suggests PAH binds to the HSA-AuNCs acting as a linker; causing aggregation and rigidification, which results in a decrease in separation between native TRP of HSA and AuNCs; improving F&ouml;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) and enhancing emission. These findings are critical to the development of brighter protein encapsulated AuNCs.</strong>
1201	<strong>Effect of morphology on optical and efficiently enhanced electrical properties of W-ZnS for UV sensor Applications</strong>	The influence of morphology on the transport properties of the ZnS nanostructures has been assessed by the electrical measurements on different ZnS nanostructures. High-quality poly (vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) capped wurtzite-ZnS (w-ZnS) micro and nanostructures have been prepared through one step hydrothermal method at low temperature. A detailed structural investigation based on XRD results and morphological analysis has been carried out using FE-SEM, TEM, SAED and HR-TEM techniques. In order to examine the formation of compound ZnS, atomic ratio of Zn to S has been found from the EDS. The bandgap of the samples calculated from the UV-visible absorption spectra in reflectance mode at room temperature. Dependence of size and shape on excitonic and trap-state emission features of the nanostructures have been investigated from the photoluminescence (PL) studies and the enhancement in PL intensity in ID nanostructures also discussed. High yield and highly crystalline long nanorods and nanowires can be considered as an excellent candidate for advanced optoelectronic systems of the future since it has a better photoconductivity as compared with micro-particles and nanoparticles.
1202	Surface plasmon resonances in a branched silver nanorod	The properties of surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) resonance modes were investigated in a branched silver nanorod consisting of two nanorods using high energy resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The experimental EELS maps of the SPP excitation showed a specific distribution depending on the resonance mode. The analytical formulas of the EELS signal and the resonance conditions for SPP resonance in the branched nanorod were derived by expanding the method reported for a one-dimensional straight resonator, and these were applied to interpret the experimental results. The SPP resonance in the branched nanorod can be attributed to Fabry-Perot type resonance that propagates in any of three different resonance paths. It was also demonstrated that the modes of SPP resonance are changed by the position of the crossing point in the branched structure, which indicates that the combination of the lengths of the respective branches can be used to control the propagation path and the resonance energy of SPP waves in branched structures.
1203	<strong>Excellent thermal stability thanks to Ge and C Doping in Sb<sub>2</sub>Te for high-speed phase change memory</strong>	<strong>Ge<sub>2.3</sub>Sb<sub>2.0</sub>Te phase change material was proposed to feature high thermal stability (10-year data retention above 220</strong><strong><sup>o</sup></strong><strong>C</strong><strong>) and fast transition speed (SET programming speed up to 5 ns) for electronic memory application. In mushroom-shaped device cells, the nanocomposite alloys implement an endurance life nearly 1&times;10<sup>5</sup>cycles with clear distribution of resistance values. Such operation speed among alloys with high-temperature characteristic is the best ever reported. And the moderate incorporation of C offers intriguing benefits that include the enhanced thermal stability and reduced RESET voltage in Ge-rich Sb<sub>2</sub>Te-based memory cells. Through microscopic analysis, the local segregation of C dopants can further refine crystalline grains and thus induce a less volume change and roughness upon heating process. These properties are crucial regarding the application potential in high-performance and high-density embedded memories.</strong>
1204	A simple model for the wall depletion length of nanoconfined DNA	We have measured the wall depletion length of DNA confined in 38 nm wide, square silicon dioxide nanochannels for five different ionic strengths between 15 mM and 75 mM. Experiments used the BioNano Genomics Irys platform for massively parallel data acquisition,  attenuating the effect of the sequence-dependent persistence length and finite-length effects by using nick-labeled E. coli genomic DNA with contour length separations of at least 30 &#x03BC;m (88,325 base pairs) between nick pairs. In excess of 5 million measurements of the fractional extension were obtained from 39,291 labeled DNA molecules. Analyzing the stretching via Odijk's theory for a strongly confined wormlike chain yielded a linear relationship between the depletion length and the Debye length that is in qualitative agreement with previously defined analytical models.
1205	Electric-field tuning of the valley splitting in silicon corner dots	We perform an excited state spectroscopy analysis of a silicon corner dot in a nanowire field-effect transistor to assess the electric field tunability of the valley splitting. First, we demonstrate a back-gate-controlled transition between single quantum dot and double quantum dot regimes that allows tuning the device in to corner dot formation. We find a linear dependence of the valley splitting on back-gate voltage, from 880 &mu;eV to 610 &mu;eV with a slope of -45 &plusmn; 3 &mu;eV/V (or equivalently a slope of -48 &plusmn; 3 &mu;eV/(MV/m) with respect to the effective field). The experimental results are backed up by tight-binding simulations that include the effect of surface roughness, remote charges in the gate stack and discrete dopants in the channel. Our results demonstrate a way to electrically tune the valley splitting in silicon-on-insulator-based quantum dots, a requirement to achieve all-electrical manipulation of silicon spin qubits.
1206	<strong>Rutherford backscattering spectrometry analysis of InGaAs nanostructures</strong>	In this paper, we demonstrate that Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) can be extended from a metrology concept applied to blanket films towards a method to analyze confined nanostructures. By a combination of measurements on an ensemble of devices and extensive simulations, it is feasible to quantify the composition of InGaAs nanostructures (16-50 nm) embedded periodically in a SiO<sub>2</sub> matrix. The methodology is based on measuring multiple fins simultaneously while using the geometrical shape of the structures, obtained from a transmission electron microscopy analysis, as input for a multitude of trajectory calculations. In this way, we are able to reproduce the RBS spectra and to demonstrate the sensitivity of the RBS spectra to the quantitative elemental composition of the nanostructures as a function of depth, to variations of their shape and mean areal coverage down to one nanometer. Thus, we establish Rutherford backscattering spectrometry as a viable quantitative characterization technique to probe the composition and structure of periodic arrays of nanostructures.
1207	Modeling of Quantum Dot Pattern Formation on Pit-Patterned Semiconductor Substrates	We develop a properly parameterized, three-dimensional continuum-scale kinetic model for monitoring the surface morphological evolution of coherently strained heteroepitaxial thin films that captures the morphological response of epitaxially grown Ge thin films on pit-patterned Si{100} substrates. The model accounts for curvature-driven atomic diffusion on the film surface, biaxial lattice misfit strain in the film, and the wetting potential between the film and the substrate. Self-consistent dynamical simulations based on our model show formation of complex nanostructures on the epitaxial film surface, including nanorings at the rims of pits, a single quantum dot at the center of a pit, as well as multiple quantum dots inside pits with rectangular openings, consistent with experimentally observed nanostructures. Our simulation results reproduce the variation in the formed nanostructural features observed experimentally by properly varying the key experimental parameters, namely, the pit size and the pit geometry. Our study sets the stage for designing systematic experimental protocols toward precise control of complex nanoring and quantum dot patterns forming on surfaces of epitaxially grown coherently strained semiconductor thin films.
1208	Three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow of Maxwell nanofluid containing gyrotactic micro-organisms with heat source/sink	This paper discusses the three-dimensional flow of Maxwell nanofluid containing gyrotactic micro-organisms over a stretching surface. The effects of magnetic field and heat source/sink are also considered. Theory of microorganisms is utilized to stabilize the suspended nanoparticles through bioconvection induced by the effects of buoyancy forces. Analytic solution for the governing nonlinearsequations is obtained by using homotopy analysis method (HAM). The effects of Deborah number, Hartmann number, mixed convection parameter, buoyancy ratio parameter, bioconvection Rayeigh number, stretcing ratio parameter, brownian diffusion and thermophoresis diffusion parameters, Prandtl number, Lewissnumber, bioconvection Lewis number, bioconvection Peclet number and the microorganisms concentration difference parameter on velocity, temperature, nanoparticle concentration and density of motile microorganisms are discussed graphically.sThe local Nusselt, Sherwood and motile micro-organisms numbers are also analyzed graphically. Several known results have been pointed out as the particular cases of the present analysis.
1209	<strong>The role of ZrO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles on interface reactions between electrodes and films to enhance dielectric strength of sol-gel Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> films</strong>	Taking Al as top electrode, a repairing layer with ultrahigh breakdown strength and resistivity was generated between the interface of sol-gel Al2O3 films and electrodes due to the interfacial anodic oxidation reaction, which effectively repaired the interfacial defects and improved the dielectric strength. More importantly, it was found that adding ZrO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle into the matrix film could further enhance the dielectric strength, since the ZrO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle is conductive to forming the repairing layer. According to the analysis of ac conduction properties, the calculation results showed that the addition of nano-ZrO<sub>2</sub> resulted in a lower potential barrier and a longer hopping distance for ionic migration. In addition, the electric field simulation indicated that nano-ZrO<sub>2</sub> addition induced a local region of high electric field in the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> matrix and thus accelerated ionic migration. As a result of these two factors, the nanocomposite structure of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/nano-ZrO<sub>2</sub> was favorable for ionic transport and further promoted interfacial reactions at the electrode-film interface. With the stronger interfacial reaction, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/nano-ZrO<sub>2</sub> films exhibited significantly enhanced dielectric strength of ~550 MV/m, in contrast with 385 MV/m for pure Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>films.
1210	<strong>Large depth focus-tunable photoacoustic tomography based on clinical ultrasound array transducer</strong>	Multi-element photoacoustic tomography (ME-PAT) systems either have an unmovable focus or have non-uniform light on the region of interest, effectively limiting the imaging depth-of-field and resolution of the technique. In this study, we developed a focus-tunable photoacoustic tomography (FT-PAT) based on a clinical ultrasound array transducer with uniform laser excitation to achieve relatively high-resolution imaging in deep tissue. Laser excitation uses an adjustable line-focus structure and ultrasound confocal reception through a delay receiving algorithm. Different depths of carbon rods were used to evaluate the zoom ability in the tissue phantom. <em>In vivo</em> depth zoom imaging performance was demonstrated by carbon nanoparticles-labeled present in living nude mouse under chicken breast. The proposed FT-PAT system was shown a great potential in clinical environment to be used in deep tumor detection.
1211	A critical assessment of the line tension determined by the modified Young's equation	Although the modified Young's equation is frequently applied to evaluate the line tension of droplets, debate concerning the value and even the sign of the line tension is ongoing. The reason for this is that the line tension defined in the modified Young's equation is not a pure line tension but an apparent line tension, which includes the effects of the Tolman length and the stiffness coefficients. In this paper, we employ molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate three-dimensional water nanodroplets on platinum surfaces, and determine their apparent line tensions by applying a linear fit to the relation of the cosine of the contact angle to the curvature of the contact line. The effects of the Tolman length and the position of the solid-liquid dividing interface on the measured line tension are investigated. On one hand, our results elucidate the reason why MD results for line tensions are so scattered, and also lend numerical support to Schimmele et al.'s theoretical predictions [J. Chem. Phys. 127, 164715 (2007)]. On the other hand, our MD simulation results demonstrate that the modified Young's equation is a useful tool to predict the macroscopic contact angle based on a linear fit of the measured contact angles at the nanoscale. The apparent line tension is, however, sensitive to the chosen position of the solid-liquid dividing interface.
1212	<strong>Size effects in TiAlNiAu thin film metal systems used to form ohmic contacts to nitride structures</strong>	In this paper, the relation between the geometry of metric space of TiAlNiAu thin film metal system and the geometry of normed functional space of its sheet resistances (functionals), that are elements of the functional space, is investigated in local approximation. The investigation provides a means to describe a lateral size effect that involves a dependency of sheet resistance R<sub>sq</sub> of TiAlNiAu metal film on its lateral linear dimensions (in (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) plane). This dependency is defined by fractal geometry of dendrites, or, more specifically, it is a power-law dependency on fractal dimension <em>D<sub>f</sub></em> value. The revealed relation has a great practical importance both for a precise calculation of thin film metal system <em>R<sub>sq</sub></em> values in designing discreet devices and ICs, and for controlling results at micro- and nanoscale in producing workflow for thin metal films and systems based on them.
1213	<strong>Deterministic Construction of Low Noise Avalanche Photodetector Materials</strong>	Over the past 40+ years, III-V materials have been intensively studied for avalanche photodetectors, driven by applications including optical communications, imaging, quantum information processing,<sup> </sup>and autonomous vehicle navigation. Unfortunately, impact ionization is a stochastic process that introduces noise, thereby limiting sensitivity and achievable bandwidths, leading to intense effort to mitigate this noise through the identification of new materials and device structures. Exploration of new materials has seen limited success as it has proceeded in a largely <em>ad hoc</em> fashion, due to little consensus regarding which fundamental properties are important. Here we report the first deterministic design of low-noise avalanche photodetector materials by alternating the composition at the monolayer scale; this represents a dramatic departure from previous approaches, which have concentrated on either new compounds/alloys or nanoscale band-engineering. In particular, we demonstrate how to substantially improve upon the noise characteristics of the current state-of-the art telecom avalanche multipliers, In<sub>0.52</sub>Al<sub>0.48</sub>As grown on InP substrates, by growing the structure as a strain-balanced digital alloy of InAs and AlAs layers, each only a few atomic layers thick.  The effective <em>k</em>-factor, which has historically been considered a fundamental material property, was reduced by 6-7&acute;. We also demonstrate that these &ldquo;digital alloys&rdquo; can significantly extend photodetector cutoff wavelength well beyond those of their random alloy counterparts.
1214	Lattice constant, bond orientational order, and solid solubility of PdPt bimetallic nanoparticles	Crystal structure deviations of bimetallic Pd-Pt nanoparticles (NPs) were investigated using synchrotron high-energy X-ray diffraction. The samples comprised Pd NPs and bimetallic Pd-Pt NPs featuring those with a Pd-core/Pt-shell structure as well as PdPt solid-solution NPs with varying diameters of 6.1, 6.7, 8.1, and 11.2 nm. The Rietveld method was used to find the lattice constant of the Pd NPs, which was larger than the bulk value; while reverse Monte Carlo modeling revealed they possessed a highly disordered structure. The lattice constants of the Pd-Pt bimetallic NPs were found to vary with the NP Pt content. For Pd-core/Pt-shell structure NPs, the lattice constants decreased with Pt content owing to lattice relaxation at the core/shell interface. After a reaction process of hydrogen absorption/desorption, the lattice constant of the resulting PdPt solid-solution NPs increased with NP Pt content, which followed Vegard&rsquo;s law. The degree of disorder of the solid-solution NPs was evaluated by the <em>P<sub>BOO</sub></em> values (i.e., structural parameters describing the deviation of the local structure from an ideal crystal structure) and was found to decrease with NP Pt content. A short-range-order parameter was introduced using a three-dimensional reverse Monte Carlo configuration structure to evaluate the atomic-scale solid solubility of the Pd<sub>0.92</sub>Pt<sub>0.08</sub> and Pd<sub>0.79</sub>Pt<sub>0.21</sub>NPs. The parameter values obtained were close to randomly dispersed in the solid-solution NPs.
1215	<strong>A study of Brownian Motion and Thermophoresis Effects on Unsteady Stagnation Point Flow of Eyring-Powell Nanofluid over a Stretching Sheet</strong>	This article concerns with the analysis of an unsteady stagnation point flow of Eyring-Powell nanofluid over a stretching sheet. The influence of thermophoresis and Brownian motion is also considered in transport equations. The nonlinear ODE set is obtained from the governing nonlinear equations via suitable transformations. The numerical experiments are performed by means of Galerkin scheme. A tabular form comparison analysis of outcomes attained via Galerkin approach and numerical scheme (RK-4) is available to show the credibility of Galerkin method. The numerical exploration is carried out for various governing parameters namely; Brownian motion, steadiness, thermophoresis, stretching ratio, velocity slip, concentration slip, thermal slip, and fluid parameters, and Hartmann, Prandtl, Schmidt numbers. The velocity of fluid enhanced with an increase in fluid and magnetic parameter for the case of opposing but the behavior is reverse for assisting case. The Brownian motion and thermophoresis parameters causes an increase in temperature for both cases (assisting and opposing). The Brownian motion parameter provide a drop in concentration while an increase is noticed for thermophoresis parameter. All the outcomes and the behavior of emerging parameters is illustrated graphically. The comparison analysis and graphical plots are endorsing the appropriateness of Galerkin method. It is concluded that the said method could be extended to other problems of complex nature.
1216	Understanding the microscopic origin behind heterogeneous properties of water confined in and around A&#x03B2;<sub>17-42</sub> protofilaments	Aggregation of amyloid beta (A&#x03B2;) peptide in the brain is responsible for onesof the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases, namely the Alzheimer'ssdisease (AD). In this study we have carried out atomistic molecular dynamicsssimulations to explore the effects of non-uniform structural distortions ofsA&#x03B2;<sub>17-42</sub> pre-fibrillar aggregates of different sizes on the microscopic structure and ordering of water molecules confined within their amphiphilic nanocores. The calculations revealed non-uniform peptide-water interactions resulting in simultaneous existence of both highly ordered and disordered water molecules within the spatially heterogeneous confined environment of the protofilament cores. Importantly, it is found that the high degree of ordering originates from a sizable fraction of core water molecules that are doubly-coordinated within their first coordination shells, while the randomly oriented ones are those that are coordinated with three neighbors in the first coordination shells. Further, it is quantitatively demonstrated that relative fractions of these two types of water molecules are correlated with the topology of the protofilament cores and the degree of confinement within those. It is proposed that the ordered core waters are likely to stabilize thesA&#x03B2; protofilaments by screening the residue charges and favoring water-mediated salt bridge formations, while the randomly oriented ones can drive further growth of the protofilaments by being displaced easily during the docking of additional peptides. In that way both types of core water molecules can play equally important roles in controlling the growth and stability of thesA&#x03B2; aggregates.
1217	<strong>Torsional strain effects on intertube friction in carbon nanotube: strain engineering in friction</strong>	The possibility of strain engineering of friction in carbon nanotube is explored by employing the molecular dynamics simulations. By study the intertube friction in carbon nanotube subjected to torsional strain, it is found that the friction can be tuned by torsional strain. It shows that the temperature has great influence on torsional strain effects on intertube friction. Mechanism and physical insight of torsional strain effects are revealed by numerical and phonon spectra analysis. The work in this letter implies the potential of strain engineering in nanoscale friction and brings new insight into fundamental understanding of strain effect mechanism in nanoscale friction.
1218	Investigation of spin Seebeck effect and magnetic damping in nanometer thick Cerium Yttrium Iron garnet films	Growth of nm thick Cerium Yttrium Iron garnet films, their magnetic damping properties and observation of Spin Seebeck effect in the films has been reported. The films in the range of 23-148 nm have been grown on gadolinium gallium garnet substrates through pulsed laser deposition technique (PLD). The films possess very good quality and smooth surfaces with a roughness of less than 0.3nm. The 148 nm thick film showed a 9.2 GHz FMR linewidth of about 14.06 mT and a damping constant of 2.5 x 10<sup>-2</sup>. The FMR line width exhibited a linear response with frequency indicating the absence of two magnon scattering. The spin Seebeck voltage in the longitudinal direction was obtained on sputtering a 10 nm thick hall bar patterned Rh on the films.
1219	Bending deformation behavior of Zr65Cu17.5Ni10Al7.5 bulk metallic glass with different solidification cooling rate	In order to further clarify the relationship between the free volume and bending plasticity, the bending properties of Zr65Cu17.5Ni10Al7.5 bulk metallic glass (BMG) samples with different thicknesses corresponding to different solidification cooling rates were investigated. The results show that the bending plasticity of Zr65Cu17.5Ni10Al7.5 BMG decreases with the decrease of cooling rate, which is consistent with the evolution of shear bands density revealed by the investigation of microstructure. These phenomena are mainly attributed to the decrease of free volume content with the decrease of cooling rates in spite of the increase of nanocrystallization fraction, which further confirm that free volume plays a crucial role in the deformation process of the BMGs.
1220	MHD flow of Fe&#x2083;O&#x2084;-nanofluid over a stretching surface with dusty particles	The present analysis examines hydromagnetic flow of dusty nanofluid by an exponentially stretching sheet. Flow in porous space is examined. Mathematical modeling is presented in presence of heat generation/absorption aspects. Homotopy algorithm leads to solutions computations. Convergence intervals are explicitly identified. Velocity and temperature are examined. Coefficient of skin friction and heat transfer rate are discussed.
1221	<strong><em>Ultrafast Laser Induced Nanostructured ITO for Liquid Crystal Alignment and Higher Transparency Electrodes </em></strong>	Femtosecond laser nanostructured indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass is shown to act both as liquid crystal (LC) alignment layer and electrode with higher transparency.  The nano patterns of 120nm period were created by directly on ITO films without any additional spin coating materials or lithography process.  Nine regions of laser-induced nanostructures were fabricated with different alignment orientations and various pulse energy levels on top of the ITO confirming the follow-up of the LC director to the lines orientation. The device interfacial anchoring energy was found to be , comparable to the anchoring energy of nematic LC on photosensitive polymers. The transparency as an electrode was found to improve due to the better antireflection and lower absorption expected from a nanostructured surface.
1222	A compact microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition based on a household microwave oven	I design an efficient compact microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MW PECVD) from a household 2.45 GHz MW oven. The MW plasma sparked by a piece of Cu foil in a low pressure down to 1 Pa. In the MW PECVD, the SiC plate is used as MW heater to realize rapid MW heating up and used to prevent the reflected power damaging the magnetron. To test the performance of the system, vertically oriented graphene nanosheets (VGNSs) were fabricated on Cu foil, which was confirmed by Raman spectra and scanning electron microscope ( SEM).
1223	<SPAN style="font-size: 18.0pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-style: normal;">Aggregation of human islet amyloid polypeptide revealed by hyperspectral imaging </SPAN>	The amyloid aggregation of proteins is a ubiquitous phenomenon associated with over 50 human diseases. Here we demonstrated the use of hyperspectral imaging of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) grafted with citrate and polyethylene glycol (PEG400 and PEG3000) as probes for identifying the aggregation states of human IAPP, a peptide associated with type 2 diabetes. Complemented by COMSOL simulation we revealed a distinct anticorrelation between increased IAPP aggregation and decreased red shifts they incurred in AuNP plasmonic resonance. This label-free strategy has the potential for facile identification of the aggregation states of a range of amyloid proteins.
1224	Magneto-hydrodynamic flow and heat transfer of a hybrid nanofluid in a rotating system between two parallel plates in the presence of thermal radiation and Joule heating	In this paper, the researchers explore heat transfer and magneto-hydrodynamic hybrid nanofluid flow in a rotating system between two parallel plates. The upper and lower plates of the system are assumed penetrable and stretchable, respectively. The thermal radiation and Joule heating impacts are considered. A similarity transformation is applied to alter the governing momentum and energy equations into non-linear ordinary differential equations that contain the appropriate boundary conditions and used the Duan-Rach Approach (DRA) to solve them. The impacts of diverse active parameters including the rotation parameter, the suction/blowing parameter, the radiation parameter the Reynolds number, the hybrid nanofluid volume fraction, and the magnetic parameter on the temperature and the velocity profiles are examined. Also, a correlation for the Nusselt number has been developed in terms of the active parameters of the present study. The outcomes indicate that the Nusselt number acts as an increasing function of the injection and radiation parameters, as well as the volume fraction of the nanofluid.
1225	Suction/injection process and thermal radiation impacts on magneto-hydrodynamic squeezing nanofluid flow and heat transfer between parallel disks considering Joule heating	In this paper, the unsteady squeezing flow and heat transfer of magneto-hydrodynamic nanofluid between two parallel disks under a suction/blowing process are studied. Thermal radiation, Joule heating and viscous dissipation impacts are considered. The researchers first converted the boundary conditions and governing momentum/energy equations into a non-dimensional form and solved them with DRA. Unlike ADM (Adomin Decomposition Method), this method permits us to discover an analytical solution without applying a numerical procedure to compute the missing parameters. The water based nanofluid is comprised of copper, copper oxide and alumina. The impacts of different parameters such as the suction/blowing parameter, the magnetic parameter, the solid volume fraction, the squeeze number, and the radiation parameter on flow and heat transfer attributes are investigated. Moreover, the value of the Nusselt number is calculated and illustrated in figures. The outcomes demonstrate that the fluid velocity ascends with the rise of the suction parameter while the temperature profile descends with the ascendance of the suction parameter.
1226	Low field manifestation of spiral ordering in sheet like BiFeO<sub>3</sub> nanostructures	Magnetic phase diagram of a material could be tuned through structural modication. Here we show significant lowering of magnetic field (H<sub>i</sub> ) required from transition from cycloidal to canted antiferromagnetic state in sheet like nanostructures of BiFeO<sub>3</sub>, in comparison to reported bulk single crystals of BiFeO<sub>3</sub>. Structural analysis of this sheet like nanostructured BFO suggests that there is more tilting in FeO<sub>6</sub> octahedra that reduces Fe-O-Fe distance in comparison to bulk BFO, leading<br />to decrease in H<sub>i</sub> through the reduction of exchange interaction strength.
1227	Random Lasing Mode Control by Application of an External Magnetic Field	This study experimentally demonstrates lasing mode switching within a ZnO nanoparticle film coated onto a magnetic thin film of NiFe alloy. When a neodymium magnet is brought close to or moved away from the film, switching behavior is observed in the lasing modes, although such change is induced in a ZnO nanoparticle film on a glass substrate. Our results suggest that the observed changes in lasing modes are because of a magnetic Kerr effect at the surface of the NiFe thin film. The small Kerr rotation would be enhanced by localized fields near the surface, inducing suppression or enhancement of the lasing modes in response to the surrounding environments, and accounting for the lasing mode switching.
1228	From MoO<sub>2</sub>@MoS<sub>2</sub> Core-shell Nanorods to MoS<sub>2</sub> Nanobelts	One-dimensional (1D) atomically thin crystals have attracted considerable interests due to their unique properties and potential applications. For example, reducing graphene physical size down to nanoscale to nanoribbons opens up band gaps, which makes graphene useful in electronic devices. Here, we report a facile approach to produce single- and bi-layered MoS<sub>2</sub> nanobelts by PMMA assisted decoupling of MoO<sub>2</sub>@MoS<sub>2</sub> core-shell nanorods. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman and photoluminescence (PL) results show that the decoupled monolayer staple-like MoS<sub>2</sub>-shells can fold into bilayer nanobelts or not depending on the PMMA removal method. Raman, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) results reveal that the left MoO<sub>2</sub> nanorods exhibit high crystal-quality. Our findings provide a method to produce 1D MoS<sub>2</sub> or MoO<sub>2</sub> nanomaterials, which have potential applications in electronics and catalysis.
1229	Many-Body Dissipative Particle Dynamics Simulations of Nano-Droplet Formation in 3D Nano-Inkjet Printing	Nano-droplet formation is a critical process in the development of 3D nano-inkjet printing. We show that Many-Body Dissipative Particle Dynamics (MDPD) can be used to predict nano-droplet formation in nano-sized nozzles with good accuracy.  A conversion methodology is also introduced to overcome the problem of large coarse-graining factor, which results in unphysical results when the simulation is scaled up to real units. Using our MDPD model and the new conversion methodology, insights into possible trends of physical quantities in nano-droplet formation of polymeric UV ink can be gained. It was found that higher temperature and applied pressure reduce droplet break-up time. In addition, higher temperature increases the droplets&rsquo; diameter while higher effective pressure reduces it. These findings suggest that the physical environment can be tuned to achieve the desired droplet properties for 3D nano-inkjet printing. Due to the technical challenges that impedes experimental testing, this work demonstrates that MDPD provides a low-cost alternative to study nano-droplet formation in 3D nano-inkjet printing.

1231	Phase Transitions in BiFeO<sub>3</sub> driven by etching highly strained thin films to nanodots	We propose a novel method to drive phase transitions by etching strained BiFeO<sub>3</sub> thin films to nanodots. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements reveal that the amount of rhombohedral-like (R)  phase increases as the BiFeO<sub>3</sub> thin films with tetragonal-like (T) matrix are etched to nanodots and larger fraction of R phase is obtained with the size reduction from 1 mm to 200 nm, indicating the T to R phase transition induced by partial release of substrate clamping. Using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), it is demonstrated that rhombohedral-like (R) to tetragonal-like (T) phase transitions can be reversibly achieved under DC electric field in BFO nanodots. Large electromechanical response has been observed in BFO nanodots as well. This approach can be extended to other strained oxide films and provide guidance for the development of high-performance electromechanical lead-free materials.
1232	<strong>Ferroelectric Polymer Nanostructure with Enhanced Flexoelectric Response for High-Density Memory</strong>	Through utilizing individual nanodots as smallest memory unit to convert stress into readable electronic information, we report force-induced high-density data storage in periodic nanostructure of ferroelectric polymer fabricated by nanoimprinting lithography. The nanostructure is ideal for stress concentration and increased non-uniformity of strains, thus leading to strain gradients inversely proportional to the feature size. A force as low as 400nN is applied to generate internal electric field in response to strain gradients, and switch polarization state of each memory unit. It can achieve storage density theoretically up to TB/inch<sup>2</sup> with the up-to-date nanofabrication technology to miniaturize unit size.
1233	Resistive Switching Behavior and Mechanism of Room-temperature-fabricated Flexible Al/TiS<sub>2</sub>-PVP/ITO/PET Memory Devices	The mixture of two-dimensional (2D) TiS<sub>2</sub> nanoflakes and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) exhibits a nonvolatile, bipolar resistive switching behavior with a low resistance state (LRS)/high resistance state (HRS) current ratio of ~10<sup>2</sup> in the devices with a flexible Al/TiS<sub>2</sub>-PVP/indium tin oxide (ITO)/polyethylene terephthalate (PET) structure. The polymer-assistant liquid-phase exfoliation of 2D nanoflakes from TiS<sub>2</sub> bulk material is processed in low-boiling solvent. And the fabrication process of these devices is performed entirely at room temperature. Such an energy-saving and scalable production process indicates a huge potential of large-scale industrial application. The AFM and TEM characterizations showed that the exfoliated 2D TiS<sub>2</sub> are flakes at micrometer scale with a layer-number of mostly 7 or 8. Both the HRS and the LRS can be kept for more than 10<sup>4</sup> s. The endurance of devices was obtained over 100 direct current (DC) sweeping cycles with remarkable separations between different resistive states. The distributions of writing (set) and erasing (reset) voltages show that set and reset voltages are small (&lt; 2 V). Also, the resistive switching characteristics of the devices are stable during 1000 bending cycles. The switching behavior is explained by the thinning and recovery of Schottky barriers within devices.
1234	Effects of tension-induced plastic deformation on mechanical and electrical conductivity response of &#xFF08;100&#xFF09;monocrystalline copper	The physical properties of a material can be affected by different stress states. In this paper, nanoindentation experiments with a maximum load of 100mN and strain-sensitive resistance tests were conducted on (100) monocrystalline copper with tension-induced plastic deformation to investigate the influences of plastic deformation on mechanical and electrical characteristics. By theoretical and experimental analysis, indentation depth, recovery rate of total work, contact area, pile-up, apparent hardness and elastic modulus for the deformed and virgin material were obtained and comparatively investigated. The results showed that under the same experimental conditions, more penetration depth (maximum and residual indentation depth) would be needed to reach the same load for the tension-deformed material. As the plastic deformation increased in the uniform plastic region, both the total and elastic indentation work increased, while the recovery rate of total work, contact area, apparent hardness and elastic modulus decreased. Meanwhile, the contribution of plastic deformation to electrical resistivity was also investigated. The quantitative relation between electrical resistivity and plastic strains was extracted from experiments. The understanding of the role of plastic deformation in mechanical and electrical properties of monocrystalline copper would be helpful to the application in damage detection systems and strain sensing sensor.
1235	Superhard Metal Borides: A Look Forward	Previous efforts towards the synthesis of superhard materials have focused on binary metal borides with short covalent bonds. We discuss the methods of enhancing the intrinsic and extrinsic hardening factors used to achieve these properties. As the realm of binary borides has all but been exhausted, there is a need to move to ternary and higher borides and to achieve greater morphological control at the nanoscale. The use of ternary and higher borides as starting materials provides a multitude of diverse compositional and structural combinations and merit further investigation as they offer the potential for the optimization of mechanical properties.
1236	Silicon nano-cone formation via low-energy helium ion sputtering	In this study, the effect of low-energy (100 eV) He+ ion irradiation on Si surface morphology is explored. Si (100) and (111) samples were irradiated with 100 eV He+ ions at an elevated sample temperature of 600 {degree sign}C and to fluences in the range 5.0&#x00D7;1019 - 2.0&#x00D7;1020 ions cm-2. Through a combination of high ion flux and high sample temperature, it was found that continued He+ ion irradiation facilitates the formation of homogeneously populated, high aspect ratio silicon nano-cones (NCs) (~50 - 100 nm base; ~200 - 400 nm height). Resulting surface morphology is shown to have excellent anti-reflective properties, suggesting potential application toward enhanced light absorption in photovoltaic and other optical applications. Furthermore, similar irradiations at reduced sample temperature show comparable structuring mechanisms but with smaller cone diameter. These results indicate that NC size and number density (and related wavelength-dependent reflectivity properties) may be tailored by carefully tuning ion irradiation conditions. Utilizing very low-energy He+ ions as the irradiating species, these studies also demonstrate an added benefit to limiting metallic surface contamination through reduced probability of sputtering in-vacuum components.
1237	<strong>Tailored tunneling magneto-dielectric effects in Co&ndash;MgF<sub>2</sub> granular nanostructures by in-situ insertion of thin MgF<sub>2</sub> layers </strong>	We propose a structural strategy that inserting several thin MgF crystalline layers into the super-paramagnetic granular structure of Co<sub>0.23</sub>&ndash;(MgF)<sub>0.77</sub>, to tailor the frequency response of tunneling magneto-dielectric (TMD) effect. The results indicate that increasing MgF interlayer thickness (<em>t</em>) from 0 to 4 nm causes the position of peak dielectric change (&Delta;<em>&epsilon;</em>&prime;/<em>&epsilon;</em>&prime;<sub>0</sub>) at a specific frequency <em>f</em><sub>TMD</sub>, to shift from 300 to 3 kHz, while also retaining a slight decrease in &Delta;<em>&epsilon;</em>&prime;/<em>&epsilon;</em>&prime;<sub>0</sub> from 2.9% to 2.4%. The magnitude of &Delta;<em>&epsilon;</em>&prime;/<em>&epsilon;</em>&prime;<sub>0</sub> was capable of being controlled by varying the Co content in the granular layers. Theoretical curve fittings predict that the TMD effect in the heterostructure arises from both the granular layers and interlayers, and a change in inter-granular distance within the interlayers leads to a shift in the position of <em>f</em><sub>TMD</sub>. This study may suggest a route toward tailoring the TMD response to a particular frequency, with potential applications in room-temperature magnetoelectric devices with high TMD response at any frequency.
1238	Ultrahigh supercapacitance in cobalt oxide nanorod film grown by oblique angle deposition technique	Nanorod films of cobalt oxide (Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) have been grown by a unique oblique angle deposition (OAD) technique in an e-beam evaporator for supercapacitor electrode applications. This technique offers a non-chemical route to achieve large aspect ratio nanorods. The fabricated electrodes at OAD 80<sup>o</sup> exhibited a specific capacitance of 2875 F/g. The electrochemically active surface area was 1397 cm<sup>-2</sup>, estimated from the non-Faradaic capacitive current region. Peak energy and power densities obtained for Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanorods were 57.7 Wh/Kg and 9.5 kW/kg, respectively.

1239	<strong>Atomistic Insights into Mechanical and Thermal Properties of Stanene with Defects</strong>	Stanene a two-dimensional, graphene-like buckled honeycomb structure material, has been synthesized in a recent experimental study. It is considered to be a potential material for the next generation nano-electronics application. In electronic applications, the materials are subjected to both thermal and mechanical loadings. In addition, structural defects are inevitable during synthesis of nanomaterials. Therefore, it is essential to study the mechanical and thermal properties of stanene with various structural defects. We investigated the effects of point vacancy, bivacancy and Stone-Wales defects on tensile response and thermal transport of single-layer stanene sheets using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. MEAM potential is used to describe the inter-atomic forces to predict the properties of the stanene adequately. We probed the deformation process of defective stanene by applying uniaxial tensile loading. Our study suggests that tensile strength and elastic modulus of stanene decrease with the increment of defect concentrations. Using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) method, we found that, the phonon thermal conductivity of stanene is highly sensitive to defect concentrations. Only 0.1% of defect concentrations result in about 40% reduction in thermal conductivity. To elucidate the underlying mechanism responsible for this reduction, vibrational density of states (vDOS) are calculated. Overall, our reported results provide an insight into the effect of defects in mechanical and thermal properties of defective stanene and will facilitate further tailoring of the design of stanene based nanoelectronics device.
1240	<em>Gas flow at the ultra-nanoscale: universal statistical predictive model and validation in nanochannels of &Aring;ngstrom resolution</em>	We report a theoretical and experimental analysis of gas transport in channels ranging in size from the ultra-nano- to the sub-microscale. A theoretical approach quantitatively predicting pressure driven gas flow in the Knudsen and transition regime was developed. This approach is equivalent to, but much more physically transparent and simple than existing Navier-Stokes descriptions of the problem with Maxwell boundary conditions. In order to benchmark our model against a precisely defined experimental system, we manufactured extremely reproducible membrane with slit nanochannels, whose sizes ranged from 2.5 to 250 nm. Volumetric gas ow in the Knudsen number range from 0.2 to 20 was measured. Excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental data was found, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach.
1241	Low-temperature homoepitaxial growth of two-dimensional antimony superlattices in silicon	We present a low-temperature process for the homoepitaxial growth of antimony superlattices in silicon. We have used low-temperature molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to embed atomically thin (2D), highly concentrated layers of dopant atoms within nanometers of the surface. This process allows for dopant densities on the order of 10<sup>13</sup>-10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> (10<sup>20</sup>-10<sup>21</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>); higher than can be achieved with three-dimensional (3D) doping techniques. This effort builds on our prior work with n-type delta doping; we have optimized our growth processes to achieve multiple, spatially-confined delta layers with sharp dopant profiles. By transitioning from a standard effusion cell to a valved cracker cell for antimony evaporation, we have achieved carrier densities approaching 10<sup>21</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> with peak distribution at ~10 &#x00C5; FWHM, the thinnest reported to date. We will discuss details related to growth optimization, and show results from in situ monitoring by electron diffraction. We will also report on elemental and electrical characterization of our films.
1242	<strong>High-performanc</strong><strong>e photodetector based on hybrid </strong><strong>of MoS<sub>2</sub> and reduced graphene oxide</strong>	Two dimensional materials are promising new class materials for next generation optoelectronic devices owing to its appealing optical and electrical properties. Pristine MoS<sub>2 </sub>is widely used in next generation photovoltaic and opto-electronic devices, but its low photo-dark current ratio prevents its uses in highly efficient photo detection applications. Here, we decorated crumpled reduced graphene oxide (rGO) particles on large-area vertically aligned MoS<sub>2</sub> flakes network for enhancing the performance of the MoS<sub>2</sub> based photodetector by forming multiple nanoscale p-n heterojunctions.The rGO/MoS<sub>2 </sub>device exhibited a significantly improved photo-responsivity of  ~ 2.10 A/W along with a good detectivity of ~ 5 &times; 10<sup>11</sup> Jones (Jones = cm Hz<sup>1/2</sup>/W) than that of MoS<sub>2</sub> photodetector in ambient atmosphere. Moreover, the rGO/MoS<sub>2</sub> photodetector showed a fast response of ~18 ms with excellent stability and reproducibility in ambient air even after three months. The high performance of the photodetector is attributed to enhanced photoexcited carrier density and suppressed photo generated electron-hole recombination due to strong local built-in electric field developed at the rGO/MoS<sub>2 </sub>interface. Our results showed that integration of rGO with MoS<sub>2</sub> provides an efficient platform for photo detection applications.
1243	<strong>Crystallization of amorphous silicon thin films induced by gold nano-particles </strong>	This work investigates the metal induced crystallization of hydrogenated amorphous silicon thin films using gold nano-particles as crystallizing mediator metal. Starting from colloidal gold solutions, electrophoresis deposition method was used to coat &lt;100&gt; oriented silicon substrates with various small amounts of Au nano-particles. Three samples were prepared for various electrophoresis deposition times. Afterwards, gold coated substrates were covered with a-Si: H films elaborated by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. All samples were submitted to a rapid thermal annealing at a fixed temperature 600&deg;C and for 90 min under N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Furthermore, Raman back scattering analysis allowed the determination of structural characteristics related to processed amorphous Si films such as the crystalline fraction, residual stresses and crystal sizes. On the basis of kinetic and thermodynamic considerations and accordingly to additional characterizations provided by both scanning electronic microscopy images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, we emphasis on highlighting the competition that took place between nucleation and growth mechanisms and led to the partial crystallization of amorphous silicon thin films.
1244	Biomedical sensing and imaging with optical fibers: innovation through convergence of science disciplines	The probing of physiological processes in living organisms is a grand challenge that requires bespoke analytical tools. Optical fiber probes offer a minimally-invasive approach to report physiological signals from specific locations inside the body. This Perspective article discusses a wide range of such fiber probes developed at the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Nanoscale BioPhotonics. Our fiber platforms use a range of sensing modalities, including embedded nanodiamonds for magnetometry, interferometric fiber cavities for refractive index sensing, and tailored metal coatings for surface plasmon resonance sensing. Other fiber probes exploit molecularly sensitive Raman scattering, or fluorescence where optical fibers have been combined with chemical and immunosensors. Fiber imaging based on interferometry and computational imaging are also discussed as emerging in vivo diagnostic methods. We provide examples to illustrate how the convergence of multiple scientific disciplines generates opportunities for the fiber probes to address key challenges in real-time in vivo diagnostics. These future fiber probes will enable the asking and answering of scientific questions that were never possible before.
1245	<strong>Intrusion of two strained-Si layers in the channel region of HOI MOSFET</strong>	A heterostructure design with two strained silicon (s-Si) layers on either side of the strained silicon germanium (s-SiGe) layer, forming a tri-layered channel heterostructure on insulator (HOI) metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) have been developed. Quantum carrier confinement ensued within both the ultrathin s-Si layers, which instigates mobility enhancement, and hence counter balances the threshold voltage roll-off induced by the strained layers in the channel region. A comparison of the conventional single s-Si on relaxed SiGe channel HOI MOSFET with double s-Si channel HOI MOSFET have been perceived leading to eloquent drain current enhancement of ~49% for channel length, L<sub>g</sub>=100nm due to the captivity of carriers with small reduction in the threshold voltage caused on the additional bottom s-Si layer. An in depth analysis of the device in the nanoscale regime for Device-B (L<sub>g</sub>=50nm) and Device-C (L<sub>g</sub>=40nm) have exemplified superior device characteristic without scaling down the overall device geometry, leading to prominence of velocity overshoot condition under low-scattering effect, augmenting mobility and drift velocity, while approaching to the quasi-ballistic transport mechanism in the channel region, therefore remarkably improving drive current of the nano-MOSFET.
1246	<strong>Diffuse discharge generation and evolution of the repetitive nanosecond pulsed dielectric barrier discharge in airflow</strong>	Diffuse dielectric barrier discharge excited by repetitive nanosecond pulses is achieved in airflow. On the introduction of airflow to the gas gap, the discharge state transforms from a filamentary one into a diffuse one at first, followed by the generation of a thin filamentary discharge at a high airflow rate. It is observed that the diffuse discharge and the thin filamentary discharge are ignited from the electrode boundary, which move towards the downstream region with a velocity below the corresponding airflow rate. Subsequent to hundreds of pulse cycles, a stationary discharge state is formed with the thin filamentary discharge in the upstream region, together with the diffuse discharge in the downstream region. The length of the thin filamentary discharge region is associated with the airflow rate, pulse repetition frequency, and applied voltage. The observations presented above are ascribed to the transverse electric field at the electrode boundary and the redistribution of charges under the action of airflow.
1247	Optical manipulation of dielectric microscopic particles and biocells using an elongated photonic jet	Flexibility trapping and manipulation of mesoscopic objects or cells in a wide range are extremely important for wide applications in physics, biology, bio-chemistry, bio-medicine, and so on. A most striking and specific feature of an elongated photonic jet (EPJ) is the extremely high spatial localization of light field in transverse direction, which can lead to a large working distance with high intensity. Based on the simulation and calculation results, we report an EPJ strategy of realizing highly flexible trapping and pushing of erythrocytes in wide-bound using a graphene-coated fiber tip. Furthermore, a photonic nanojet can also be obtained by adjusting the parameters of the EPJ.
1248	Elinvar Behavior of Deformed Fe-Ni Invar Alloy	We report a deformation induced Elinvar behavior in a prototype Fe-Ni Invar alloy. We observe that the temperature-dependent elastic modulus is associated with a premartensitic transformation characterized by forming nano-scale domains, and the transformation can be impeded by restricting the growth of nanodomains. Upon appropriate deformation, the modulus softening accompanying the transformation compensates the modulus hardening due to vibrational anharmonicity upon cooling, leading to Elinvar behavior over a wide temperature range. This work develops an alloy with Invar and Elinvar effects simultaneously, and may enhance the understanding on the nature of Invar and Elinvar anomalies from the aspect of structure.
1249	Tuning the Electronic Structure of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube by High-Pressure H<sub>2</sub> Exposure	We report on an electronic structure change of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) due to electron doping via high-pressure H<sub>2</sub> exposure. Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were carried out to support the <em>in situ</em> electrical measurements. The XPS data shows the fractional coverage of hydrogenated carbon atoms to be <em>&theta;</em><em> </em>= 0.165 (1.34 weight %), which is consistent with <em>&theta; </em>= 0.163 calculated from the <em>I</em><sub>ds</sub>-<em>V</em><sub>g</sub> measurements. In particular, we used the dissociative Langmuir-type model to yield the desorption coefficient <em>k</em><sub>des</sub> by fitting it to the <em>in situ</em> electrical data. Finally, we adopted this hydrogenation method for the SWNT network on the commercial Si/SiO<sub>2</sub> substrate to open the possibility of the scalable logic circuits made of the SWNT network with conventional semiconductor fabrication process.
1250	Numerical Investigation on Effects of Curvature and Wettability of Particle on Heterogeneous Condensation	The incipient process of water vapor condensation around an insoluble nanoscale particle is studied by Molecular Dynamics method and the emphasis is placed on the effects of nucleus surface curvature and wettability. With a high initial saturation, two different linear nucleation stages are observed. At the first stage, clusters are formed by the water molecules adsorbed on the surface such that the nucleation rate is significantly affected by both water molecule flux towards the surface and adsorption probability. The former decreases with the surface curvature and the latter is in proportion to the wettability. At the second stage, the nucleation rate is enhanced by the contribution of homogeneous clusters adsorbed to the surface and reduced by cluster merging because of the space limitation on small nucleus. As a result, the nucleation rate is basically not affected by the nucleus size. The average size of clusters keeps constant for a while, then starts to grow with a gradually increased growth rate. It is concluded that both curvature and wettability of nucleus surface promote the cluster growing.
1251	Speed-of-sound estimation of dual-acoustic waves using laser-activated nanodroplets	Inhomogeneity of speed of sound in a medium can cause degradation of photoacoustic and ultrasound signals due to phase aberration. To achieve a high coherency of the received waves in time-delay focusing during photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging, the actual speed of sound is required. This study evaluates the feasibility of a speed-of-sound estimation method for dual photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging using laser-activated phase-change perfluorohexane nanodroplets (PFHnDs). In our speed-of-sound estimation method, PFHnDs play a critical role because the nanodroplets can generate both photoacoustic and ultrasound signals upon laser irradiation. The photoacoustic waveforms generated from the PFHnDs are used to identify the actual speed of sound in the medium by iteratively comparing the estimated delay from the delay-compensated waveforms and geometric delay of the PFHnDs. The proposed method demonstrates that the estimated sound of speed (ESS) is close to the expected speed of sound for the medium (deviation = 0.3%). Compared with the typically assumed speed of sound in tissue (1,500 m/s), ESS significantly improved lateral resolution and coherence factor in the photoacoustic (up to 2.8 and 1.7 times, respectively) and ultrasound (up to 3.3 and 3.6 times, respectively) images. Therefore, the proposed speed-of-sound estimation method using PFHnDs can be useful for phase aberration correction in dual ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging.
1252	Investigation of various Magnetic features of spinel type Cobalt ferrite nanoparticles tuned by annealing temperature	Cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) nanoparticles synthesized by chemical co-precipitation method were studied to see the effect of annealing temperatures on the structural parameters and magnetic properties of the sample. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and SAD pattern demonstrated that single face (fcc) spinel structure of CoFe2O4 has been formed showing particles in completely crystalline state which was further confirmed by the lattice parameter and the unmixed hkl values. The particle size is in the range of about 5-10 nm depending on the annealing temperature from 200{degree sign}C to 400{degree sign}C. The grain growth occurred monotonically with the increase of annealing temperature. The magnetic properties demonstrated a strong dependence on particle size. The saturation magnetization Ms, remanent ratio Mr/Ms and coercivity Hc increased with the increase of particle size. The hysteresis curves for samples of different grain size showed the ferrimagnetic behavior which is completely analogous to the slow relaxation sextet peaks of M&#x00F6;ssbauer spectroscopy. Other parameters such as chemical shift, quadruple splitting and hyperfine field and site occupancy of Fe3+ were determined by M&#x00F6;ssbauer spectroscopy. Ferrimagnetic to superparamagnetic transition temperature known as blocking temperature TB was determined from the temperature dependent magnetization curves. With the increase of grain size, Blocking temperature also increases. Maximum entropy changes due to magnetic phase transition were also observed for mentioned annealing temperatures in the context of Magnetocaloric effect.
1253	A Novel Shadow Mask Aligner based on Three Points Leveling for Wedge Error Compensation	This paper reports a novel shadow mask aligner, which is capable of aligning planar with ~ 1 &#x00B5;m alignment error as well as provision to compensate the wedge error by using movements of three precision linear actuators, spotted under optical microscope. The use of three points leveling also overcomes the common error of the upper assembly bending, which could occur with time after its continuous use. The reported wafer/ mask holding mechanism is able to accommodate substrates of 3 inch to 6 inch diameter. The unique magnetic clamping mechanism after alignment has been successfully demonstrated. The fabricated system is useful for alignment of mask and wafer, as well as for other applications like  nano-imprint and micro-contact printing lithography, where molds/ stamp has to be aligned with the patterned/ un-patterned target substrate; to create complex 3D structures, micro-assembly of independently fabricated 2D components by proper aligning and clamping.
1254	<strong>A Surface Potential based Compact Model for 2D-FETs with Disorders Induced Transition Behaviors</strong>	A surface potential based compact model for two-dimensional field effect transistors (2D-FETs) is proposed to incorporate the structural disorders induced transition behaviors among variable range hopping (VRH), nearest neighbor hopping (NNH), and band-like transport in most 2D materials. These functions coupled with effective transport energy and multiple trapping and releasing theory enable our developed model to predict the temperature and carrier density dependent current characteristics. Its validity is confirmed by the experimental results such as the metal insulator transition (MIT) in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and VRH-NNH transition in black phosphorus nanoribbon (BPNR). Based on this model, the band-tail effects on the crossover gate voltage of MIT behavior are quantitatively investigated. It is found that the transition behavior is closely related to the distribution of the band-tail states. Furthermore, this model is implemented in Verilog-A for circuit-level prediction and evaluation of 2D-FETs to provide deeper insight into the relationship between material properties, device physics and circuit performances.
1255	<strong>Effect of gadolinium on magnetization, MCD and EMR of </strong><strong>&epsilon;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles arising in borate glasses</strong>	A series of K<sub>2</sub>O-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> glasses doped with 1.5 mass % of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and different concentrations of Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>from 0.1 to 1.0 mass % was prepared using a conventional melt quenching technique and subjected to an additional thermal treatment. The morphology and structure of the glasses were characterized by means of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and high resolution electron microscopy. Static magnetic measurements, magnetic circular dichroism and electron magnetic resonance (EMR) were used to study the properties of the glasses. In all thermally treated glasses magnetic nanoparticles are formed. The distribution of the dopants in the glass matrix and the nanoparticle characteristics greatly depend on Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> contents. The nanoparticle structure and magnetic characteristics bear a certain similarity with those of &epsilon;- Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Meanwhile, in the presence of Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> Gd<sup>3+</sup> ions are partially substituting Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions in the nanoparticle lattice, thus altering their structural parameters and lowering the nanoparticle magnetization. Analysis and computer simulations of EMR spectra of the glasses allow separating the contribution of electron paramagnetic resonance of diluted iron ions and demonstrate a superparamagnetic character of the nanoparticle EMR.
1256	<strong>Enhanced pyroelectric properties of 1-3 nanocomposites achieved by uniaxial stretching</strong>	Ceramic-polymer pyroelectric composites with favorable flexibility hold great potential for wearable sensors and energy harvesters, and the further improvement in pyroelectric properties would push them closer to practical application. In this work, we propose a uniaxial stretching method to optimize the perfor&shy;mance of lead zirconate titanate nanowires (PZT NWs)/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) 1-3 composites with a combination of the enhanced pyroelectric coefficient by inducing more <em>&beta;</em> phase PVDF and decreased permittivity by reorientation of NWs in the polymer matrix. As a result, the figure of merit (FOM) of the stretched composite with orientated PZT NWs increases to the value of 2.18&times;10<sup>-10</sup> C&middot;cm<sup>-2</sup>&middot;K<sup>-1</sup>, which is 619% higher than that of untreated samples around room temperature. This work could provide an efficient approach to fabricate high-performance ceramic-polymer pyroelectric composites.
1257	Mean-field density functional theory of a nanoconfined classical, three-dimensional Heisenberg fluid. II. The interplay between molecular packing and orientational order	As in part I of this series of papers [S. M. Cattes et al., J. Chem. Phys. 144, 194704 (2016)], we study a Heisenberg fluid confined to a nanoscopic slit pore with smooth walls. The pore walls can either energetically discriminate specific orientations of the molecules next to them or are indifferent to molecular orientations. Unlike in part I we employ a version of classical density functional theory that allows us to explicitly account for the stratification of the fluid (i.e., the formation of molecular layers) as a consequence of the symmetry-breaking presence of the pore walls. We treat this stratification within the White Bear version (Mark I) of fundamental measure theory. Thus, in this work we focus on the interplay between local packing of the molecules and orientational features. In particular, we demonstrate why a critical end point can only exist if the pore walls are not energetically discriminating specific molecular orientations. We analyze in detail the positional and orientational order of the confined fluid and show that reorienting molecules across the pore space can be a two-dimensional process. Last but not least, we propose an algorithm based upon a series expansion of Bessel functions of the first kind with which we can solve certain types of integrals in a very efficient manner.
1258	The evolution of structural topology of forming nanocrystalline silicon film by atomic-scale mechanism-driven model based on realistic continuous network	In order to establish the description of realistic structural evolution of growth film&#xFF0C;we propose a local definite continuous random network (CRN) structure combination with kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method based on the atomic-scale mechanism from first-principles density-functional-theory computations and molecular-dynamics computations to elucidate the evolution of elaborate topological structure and the transformation from amorphous phase to nanocrystalline phase of silicon films, which is essentially attributed to the atomic interactive behavior of film growth. It predicts the realistic structural networks of growing film at various temperatures based on various atomic-scale mechanisms competing with each others, which not only essentially drive the radical from physisorption to chemisorption with film surface, but also cruelly influence the chemical composition of film surface. Especially, we find the evolution of topological structure critical dependence on the compositions of film surface and H-induced crystallization mechanism, which give the important information to the optimized strategy of deposition condition for forming local crystalline. The results of evolution of structural network indicate that the structure of film is similar the continuous random network model's representation at relative lower temperature, and is in full agreement with the inhomogeneous crystalline model at relative higher temperature. Our CRN-KMC realistic structure model has significances for exploring the relation of various atomic-scale mechanisms to the phase transformation of growing film.
1259	<strong>From MoO<sub>2</sub>@MoS<sub>2</sub> Core-shell Nanorods to MoS<sub>2</sub> Nanobelts</strong>	One-dimensional (1D) atomically thin crystals have attracted considerable interests due to their unique properties and potential applications. For example, reducing graphene physical size down to nanoscale to nanoribbons opens up band gaps, which makes graphene useful in electronic devices. Here, we report a facile approach to produce single- and bi-layered MoS<sub>2</sub> nanobelts by PMMA assisted decoupling of MoO<sub>2</sub>@MoS<sub>2</sub> core-shell nanorods. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman and photoluminescence (PL) results show that the decoupled monolayer staple-like MoS<sub>2</sub>-shells can fold into bilayer nanobelts or not depending on the PMMA removal method. Raman, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) results reveal that the left MoO<sub>2</sub> nanorods exhibit high crystal-quality. Our findings provide a method to produce 1D MoS<sub>2</sub> or MoO<sub>2</sub> nanomaterials, which have potential applications in electronics and catalysis.
1260	<strong>Entropy analysis for radiative flow of Cu and SWCNT-nanofluid past static/moving wedge subject to viscous dissipation and convective condition</strong>	<em>The steady tow-dimensional boundary layer flow of nanofluid by static or moving wedge is studied. Entropy generation is analyzed in the presence of thermal radiation and viscous dissipation with convective boundary condition. Two different types of nanoparticles, namely copper Cu and single wall carbon nanotube SWCNT with water as the base fluid are considered. The governing partial differential equations (PDE) are transformed into a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODE). The optimal homotopy asymptotic method (OHAM) is applied to derive an explicit analytical solution, which provides an effective technique for solving strongly nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The analytical results of the dimensionless temperature and velocity have been validated with </em><em>fourth-fifth order Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg numerical solution and numerous researchers results [28,48-50]. Further the analytical results for the entropy generation number and Bejan number are also presented These results show the effects of thermal, dynamic and geometric parameters on entropy production.</em>
1261	Dramatic enhancement in heat conduction ability of graphene nanoplatelets through edge compared to basal plane functionalization	We demonstrate, through molecular dynamics simulations and non-equilibrium Green&rsquo;s function calculations, that edge-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets can provide up to 70% higher enhancement in thermal conductivity of polymer composites compared to basal plane functionalized nanoplatelets. This larger effectiveness of edge-bonded nanoplatelets is found to be due to a combination of two effects, first, edge bonding couples all of the layers of the nanoplatelet with the polymer matrix, enabling the entire nanoplatelet to be effective in heat transfer, and second, interface thermal conductance is found to be higher for a polymer chain bonded on the edge compared to basal plane of the nanoplatelet. Understanding of the role of nanoplatelet geometry and grafting density of polymer chains in modifying the advantage of edge bonding is provided. These results can have important implications for developing high thermal conductivity polymer-graphene nanocomposites.
1262	Atmospheric pressure Non-thermal Plasma-liquid interactions for template-free synthesis of Al doped CdS nanorods	In this study, Al doped CdS nanorods were grown via a novel non-thermal plasma-liquid interaction (PLI) at atmospheric pressure. Cd (SO4), Al (NO3)3 and Na2S2O3 were used as precursors and Thioglycolic acid as capping agent. Crystalline structure, morphology and optical properties of nanomaterials have been characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), photoluminescence (PL) and UV-Vis analyses. XRD patterns showed that as Al incorporates into CdS, the hexagonal phase of CdS developed in new crystalline planes. The FESEM imaging confirmed that one directional Al doped CdS nanorods (NRs) were fabricated via PLI method. It was also depicted that NRs size increases simultaneously when plasma treatment time increases till it reaches a diameter and length of 80 and 500nm, respectively, after 50 minutes of plasma treatment. EDS analysis demonstrated that Al was introduced in CdS structure successfully via this plasma method. The optimal PL intensity of QD NRs was reached after 40min synthesis time and Al concentration of 1%. Also as treatment time increases, PL and absorption spectra is red-shifted. The nanostructures indicated a good activity for methyl orange photo-degradation as a pollution, in which the activity largely increased after Al-doping. Impedance spectroscopy indicated an enhancement of the electron transport via Al insertion in CdS nanorods.
1263	<strong>Role of the conducting polyaniline interphase on the electric and magnetic transport of manganite nanocomposites</strong>	In the present report, we aim to show the synergistic effect of conducting polyaniline and manganite based nanocomposites focusing on the electrical and magneto-electric transport. We gave special attention on the different contribution of both, manganite nanoparticles and conducting polyaniline thin interphase, in a broad range of temperatures and low applied magnetic fields. Our results showed a small increment on the electrical conductivity and enhancement on the magnetoresistance for low polyaniline additions with respect to the manganite unloaded samples. We also found that close to room temperature, the changes in magnetoresistance are mostly due to an increment of the spin polarization and the spin disorder with respect to pure manganites. However, at intermediate temperatures (T=200 K) the polyaniline interphase intrinsic magnetoresistance showed a notorious contribution to the total negative magnetoresistance response. At low temperatures, no enhancement on the magnetoresistance response was observed, possibly due to a negative-to-positive transition of polyaniline intrinsic magnetoresistance.
1264	<strong>Tears of an evaporating meniscus </strong>	We identify the formation of an unstable rim at the three-phase contact line of an evaporating methanol meniscus due to the autophobic nature of the liquid. Undulations along the rim rupture at a consistent frequency, leaving behind a regular pattern of droplet tears as the contact line recedes. We characterize the geometry and undulation dynamics of the rim. The rim movement exhibits slip at the contact line; the measured ratio of rim width to undulation wavelength matches the critical unstable Rayleigh ratio for an intermediate slip regime. Unlike previously observed rim instabilities, the rim volume here is replenished from the evaporating bulk meniscus and maintains a constant thickness, such that the instability wavelength remains constant and droplets are generated with a consistent, nano-liter volume and deposited in a regular pattern. Occurrence of this unstable rim during an evaporation-driven dewetting process may allow for rapid, controlled deposition of small droplets from the fast-moving contact line of a highly volatile fluid.
1265	Mophology dependence of low temperatures exchange bias Co/CoO core-shell nanoparticles/spheres by eco-friendly solvothermal route	The present work reports the magnetic effect of particle shape and superparamagnetic property in a Co/CoO core-shell exchange bias system. Co/CoO core-shell nanoparticles/spheres (NPSs) of different sizes including regular and irregular mophologies were synthesized by the decomposition of cobalt acetate under solvothermal conditions. Unlike irregular nanoparticles with excess PVP stabilizer, the Co/CoO NPSs with stabilizer are uniform spheres because the size and shape of these samples can be well tuned by suitable stabilizer. Regular and irregular Co/CoO NPSs all display superparamagnetism at room temperature. It can be seen in hysteresis loop patterns that the saturation magnetization (MS) values of the Co/CoO NPSs are 100.6, 76.1, and 75.9 emu/g, whose diameters are 16, 200 and 300 nm, respectively. The measurements are carried out after the field-cooling at different temperatures across the Neel temperature of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) CoO shell. It's a surprise that all of regular Co/CoO NPSs reveal exchange bias field at low temperature whereas irregular ones disappear. what's more with the reducing ferromagnetic (FM) Co core diameter, the exchange bias increases.
1266	<strong>Enhanced anharmonic coupling of surface optical phonon with Raman scattering in CdTe thin film</strong>	Surface optical phonon modes (SO) are characteristic atomic vibrations confined within the first several atom layers of the free surface of a polar solid material. Raman scattering of the SO modes is hardly to be observed due to extremely weak scattering from the few surface atom layers. In principle the SO modes are associated with a long-range Fr&ouml;ehlich interaction with the optical modes in a polar material and would lead to strong or weak anharmonic coupling with these modes depending on mode polarization. This coupling in an ultra-thin film would have a profound effect on carrier transport when a polar material is the active layer in an electronic device. In this report both the SO and the bulk Raman scattering efficiency were dramatically enhanced in CdTe thin films by employing silver nano-plasmonic enhanced Raman scattering and maximized free surface atomic vibration. Raman scattering phonon overtones of the longitudinal optical mode (A1 LO) up to the fifth order were observed. Strong and rich information on the multi-phonon anharmonic coupling of the SO with the LO mode and the overtones were well resolved and clarified.
1267	Synthesis of &beta;-FeSi<sub>2</sub> nanowires by using silicon nanowire templates	Si nanowires templates were grown by a Cu-catalyzed vapor&ndash;liquid&ndash;solid process and used for the preparation of &beta;-FeSi<sub>2</sub> nanowires on a Si substrate. The silicon nanowires were transformed into &beta;-FeSi<sub>2</sub> nanowires by annealing with additional source material containing FeCl<sub>2</sub> and Si powder. In contrast to uniform Si nanowire templates along the &lt;111&gt; direction, the synthesized nanowires were deformed irregularly. The electron diffraction pattern of the nanowires synthesized from the template corresponded to that of single-crystalline &beta;-FeSi<sub>2</sub> and the longitudinal direction of the nanowire was along the &lt;104&gt; direction. The energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis confirmed that the nanowire contained Fe and Si in an atomic ratio of approximately 1:2. The results confirmed that &beta;-FeSi<sub>2</sub> nanowires on a Si substrate were synthesized from the Si nanowire templates.
1268	Appearance of ferromagnetism property for Si nano-polycrystalline body and vanishing of electrical resistances at local high frequencies	Reduction in the skin effect for the sintered Si nanopolycrystalline body as an electricity conductor at a high frequency was studied. Singular vanishing of electrical resistances, close to 0 m&#x03A9;, near a local high magnetic harmonic frequency of a few MHz was observed at room temperature. Also, negative resistance was observed. It will be applicable to electronic transmittance lines or semiconductors. Sintered Si nano-polycrystalline body has ferromagnetism judged by the measured magnetization property. High-density dangling bonds cause the sintered Si nanopolycrystalline to have ferromagnetism. The density of the unpaired electrons in the sintered Si nanopolycrystalline was estimated using ESR.
1269	The ultrafast charge transfer in the CVD-grown WS<sub>2</sub>/WSe<sub>2</sub> heterostructure	A WS<sub>2</sub>/WSe<sub>2</sub> heterostructure is constructed by stacking a WS<sub>2</sub> monolayer on the top of WSe<sub>2</sub> monolayer fabricated with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique. Ultrafast transient spectroscopy is used to demonstrate the ultrafast charge transfer and dynamics in the heterostructure. When the WS<sub>2</sub>/WSe<sub>2</sub> heterostructure was photoexcitated at 617 nm (A-exciton of WS<sub>2</sub>), an ultrafast photobleaching was observed around the A-exciton transition of WSe<sub>2</sub> layer at 749 nm. The bleaching signal lasts several nanosecond, which is much longer than the A-exciton lifetime in both the WS<sub>2</sub> and WSe<sub>2</sub> monolayer film. Moreover, by selectively photoexcited the heterostructure at wavelength of 749 nm (A-exciton of WSe<sub>2</sub>), an ultrafast photobleaching was identified around the A-exciton transition of WS<sub>2</sub>, the recovery of the bleaching shows a single exponential relaxation with typical time constant of ~1.8 ps. The very fast relaxation in the heterostructure probing around 620 nm suggests that there are rich defect states in WS<sub>2</sub>, which can trap these electrons transferred from the WSe<sub>2</sub> upon photoexcitation. Our spectroscopic results reveal that our CVD-grown WS<sub>2</sub>/WSe<sub>2</sub> bilayer film has a type II heterostructure in nature at room temperature. With photoexcitation, electrons and holes can be separately confined in WS<sub>2</sub> and WSe<sub>2</sub> layer, respectively.
1270	Modeling of Electron and Phonon Contributions to Thermal Conductivity of Crystalline and Amorphous TiN Nanotubes in the Sub 20 nm Regime	Size reduction in microelectromechanical systems leads to a more complex treatment of physical parameters affected by quantum mechanical effects. Besides specific electrical resistance, thermal conductivity is a characteristic variable for designing application-specific MEMS. Nanotubes are able to realize an electrical contact between a sensor element and CMOS substrate by an increased thermal isolation. A model for the prediction of thermal conductivity of nanotubes, compounded of alloys like titanium nitride, is presented here. Therefore crystal structure is taken into account to demonstrate the most limiting parameters of mean free path for electrons and phonons in thin layer geometries in combination with an 3D-2D transition in density of states. Concerning these effects, the dominating thermal conductance mechanism varies between phonons and electrons in TiN.
1271	<strong>Au-Si plasmonic platforms: synthesis, structure and FDTD simulation</strong>	Plasmonic platforms based on Au nanostructures have been successfully synthesized by directional solidification of eutectic of Au thin films. In order to determine homogeneous shape and space distribution, the influence of annealing conditions and the initial thickness of Au film on nanostructures was analyzed. For the surface morphology studies, SEM and AFM measurements were performed. The structure of platforms was investigated using XRD and XPS methods. Structural investigations confirmed, that nanostructures consist of metallic Au,  growing in (111) direction. The most homogeneous seems to be platform obtained by solidification of 2.8 nm Au film, annealed at 550&deg;C for 15 min. This sample was subsequently chosen for theoretical calculations. Simulations of electromagnetic field propagation through the produced samples were  performed using FDTD method. The calculated absorbance, as a result of the FDTD simulation shows a quite good agreement with experimental data, obtained in UV-Vis range.
1272	<strong>Synthesized Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoflowers coated Mach Zehnder Interferometer as magnetometer with large dynamic range</strong>	Promising application after synthesis of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoflowers to stimulate magnetic field detection in large dynamic range using Mach Zehnder Interferometric approach is presented. Technology relevant aspects of present study and current limitations are also highlighted. Earlier developed sensors for the magnetic field detection using magnetic fluid covers up to around 400 mT, which limits the application for higher magnetic field sensing. In present study, we first time proposed a fiber optic Mach Zehnder interferometer (MZI) based magnetic field sensor in the range of 0 to 1.5 Tesla by optimizing the coating of prepared magnetic nanoflower around the sensing probe. The interaction between modes of tapered fiber and <em>magnetic nanoflowers coated on the probe, shift the interference pattern on the application of applied magnetic field. This facilitates in providing larger operating range to the device which can be used in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for online monitoring of magnetic field.</em>
1273	Field operating window of nanodevices employing the domain wall propagation through the stripes intersection: numerical optimization	In this paper, we present the detailed numerical study of the domain wall (DW) dynamics in thin magnetic stripes and in nanostructures containing intersections of such stripes. We focus on the DW propagation through these intersections (crosses), because they are the key element in field-based multiturn sensors and magnetic logic devices. The DW propagation through such intersections is the main bottleneck by ensuring the functional reliability of the above mentioned devices due to the strong pinning of a DW at these crosses and the risk that a wrong cross 'shoulder' is reversed by the DW propagation. By means of micromagnetic simulations, the operating field range for the desired DW propagation through the stripes intersection in devices with a constant stripe width is determined and the drawbacks of this simple design are discussed. To overcome these drawbacks, we suggest a new sensor design employing the stripes with a modulated width. We show that sensors with this design are expected to have a higher reliability, and that their field operating window can be controlled in a more flexible way.
1274	Evidence of interface driven thermal rectification in a graphene-bilayer graphene junction	We report on a series of controlled computational experiments based on nonequilibrium molecular dynamics and show that at the nanoscale the thermal rectification is determined by the thermal boundary resistance and cannot be explained without it. In the graphene--bilayer graphene system that we study, the sign of the thermal rectification is opposite to the value predicted based on bulk-derived models, i.e. phonons preferentially flow in the opposite direction, outlining the importance of properly accounting for the active role of the interface.
1275	Long-lived quantum speedup based on plasmonic hot spot systems	Long-lived quantum speedup serves as a fundamental component for quantum algorithms. The quantum walk is identified as an ideal scheme to realize the long-lived quantum speedup. However, one finds that the duration of quantum speedup is too short in real systems to implement the quantum algorithms. The speedup can last only dozens of femtoseconds in the photosynthetic light-harvesting system, which was regarded as the best candidate for quantum information processing. Here, we construct one plasmonic system with two-level molecules embodied in the hot spots of one-dimensional nanoparticle chains to realize the long-lived quantum speedup. The coherent and incoherent coupling parameters in the system are obtained by means of Green's tensor technique. Our results reveal that the duration of quantum speedup in our scheme can exceed 500 fs under strong coherent coupling conditions, which is several times larger than that in the photosynthetic light-harvesting system. Our proposal presents a competitive scheme to realize the long-lived quantum speedup, which is very beneficial for quantum algorithms.
1276	Dramatic enhancement in heat conduction ability of graphene nanoplatelets through edge compared to basal plane functionalization	We demonstrate, through molecular dynamics simulations and non-equilibrium Green&rsquo;s function calculations, that edge-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets can provide up to 70% higher enhancement in thermal conductivity of polymer composites compared to basal plane functionalized nanoplatelets. This larger effectiveness of edge-bonded nanoplatelets is found to be due to a combination of two effects, first, edge bonding couples all of the layers of the nanoplatelet with the polymer matrix, enabling the entire nanoplatelet to be effective in heat transfer, and second, interface thermal conductance is found to be higher for a polymer chain bonded on the edge compared to basal plane of the nanoplatelet. Understanding of the role of nanoplatelet geometry and grafting density of polymer chains in modifying the advantage of edge bonding is provided. These results can have important implications for developing high thermal conductivity polymer-graphene nanocomposites.
1277	Stable plasmon excitations in quantum nanowires	Stable electrostatic plasmon excitations due to propagation of Gaussian electron pulse are studied in a cylindrical nanowire of radius "a" and length "L". For this purpose, we consider conduction electrons that follow the quantum hydrodynamical model to account for quantum statistics, quantum diffraction and exchange-correlation effects in the presence of classical static ions. The use of well-known Fourier transform technique and Trivelpiece-Gould configuration leads to the generalized dispersion for plasmon with finite mode quantization effects via the radial and azimuthal mode indices, as well with quantum settings. The excitations of plasmon wakefield appear when the electron beam propagates with a constant velocity along the axial direction of nanowire. The stability conditions are also analyzed for the existentence of wakefield excitations by solving three important inequalities using typical parameters of gold nanowire. The results may prove useful for understanding the plasmon excitations in quantum nanowires, where electrons can be trapped and accelerated in the wakefield to emit radiation in the extreme-ultraviolet range.
1278	Transient Analysis of Avalanche Transistor-based Marx Circuit with Pulse Output of Sub-nanosecond Rise Time and High Repetition Frequency	Avalanche transistor-based Marx circuit can produce the short pulse with sub-nanosecond rise time and several kilovolts (kV) amplitude, which is used in ultra-wideband (UWB) radiation, bioelectromagnetics, discharge plasma, and etc. The main contribution of this paper is the analysis of two transient processes for this kind Marx circuit to produce pulses. For the transient analysis of pulse forming process, the signal integrity is crucial due to the high frequency characteristic. A Marx circuit model considering segmented transmission line is established, which not only contains the distribution parameters, but also can be used to analyze the traveling wave process in the pulse forming process. The transient analysis of charging process is divided into three periods, and the transistor recovery process after avalanche breakdown is focused on. The main limiting factors affecting the avalanche recovery time is analyzed considering the physical mechanism of avalanche breakdown, which restricts the highest repetition frequency of output pulses. Based on the two transient processes, some new circuit designs are presented, including the adjustment of the pulse tail, the multistage series of Marx circuit for pulse amplitude modulation and high repetition frequency Marx circuit.
1279	Percolation probability in a system of cylindrical particles	A broad variety of materials, ranging from composites and heat transfer nano-fluids to electrochemical energy storage electrodes, widely employ cylindrical particles of various aspect ratios, such as carbon nanotubes. These particles are generally excellent conductors of heat and electricity, and when dispersed in a continuous medium influence dramatically the transport properties of the heterogeneous material by forming a percolating network. While significant numerical and analytical works explore the critical particle density leading to the onset of percolation, there is less work devoted to the heterogenous material's properties at particle densities significantly beyond percolation threshold. The most widely-used theory is based on the scaling hypothesis, which is only appropriate for small deviations from percolation threshold. In an effort to develop analytical theories based on network microstructure rather than the scaling hypothesis, we here present an analytical probabilistic model capturing the contact number distribution and percolation probability at all particle concentrations for a network of randomly positioned, soft-core, cylindrical particles with finite aspect ratio. We show that our analytical theory agrees well with numerical and experimental results predicting the percolation threshold. Our theory further predicts a scaling parameter, the particle aspect ratio multiplied by particle concentration, and networks with identical values are expected to exhibit similar macroscopic behavior. The model presented here capturing the percolating network topology can serve as the foundation for analytical composition-structure-property relationships for heterogeneous materials with conducting cylindrical particles.
1280	Space-charge and current non-uniformities, and contact resistivity of end-bonded metal contacts to thin heavily doped semiconductor nanowires	Prior work calculated the contact resistivity, <em>&rho;<sub>cN</sub></em>, of <em>end-bonded</em> metal contacts on n-type silicon NanoWires (NWs) of radius, <em>R</em> = 5-10 nm<sup> </sup>and doping, <em>N<sub>d</sub></em> = 10<sup>18</sup>-10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>; it described the internal physics briefly and qualitatively, and considered long NWs and high barrier heights, <em>&Phi;</em><em><sub>b0</sub></em> = 0.8-1.0 V. The present work extends the <em>&rho;<sub>cN </sub></em>calculations to low <em>&Phi;<sub>b0</sub></em> = 0.4-0.6 V contacts with long NWs, and to low to high <em>&Phi;<sub>b0</sub></em> = 0.4-0.8 V contacts with short NWs of length, <em>L<sub>NW</sub></em> &le; long NW space-charge width. It calculates the space-charge and current distributions in contacts with <em>L<sub>NW</sub></em> = 50 nm - 2 &mu;m and low to high <em>&Phi;<sub>b0</sub></em> = 0.4-0.8 V to provide the following insights: (i) Radial non-uniformity in space-charge width and current are high enough to violate the plane space-charge edge assumption employed to model NW junctions analytically. The non-uniformity peaks at <em>N<sub>d</sub></em> where bulk depletion width &asymp; 2.14<em>R</em>, for large metal and small surface charge. (ii) Low <em>&Phi;<sub>b0</sub></em> contacts are tunneling dominated, and their <em>&rho;<sub>cN</sub></em> versus <em>N<sub>d</sub></em> behavior differs qualitatively from that of high <em>&Phi;<sub>b0 </sub></em>contacts. (iii) Practical <em>L<sub>NW</sub></em> can be &le; long NW space-charge width, for <em>N<sub>d</sub></em> &le; 10<sup>19</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>. Shortening the <em>L<sub>NW</sub></em> reduces the space-charge non-uniformity and increases (reduces) the tunneling (GR) current. However, the current non-uniformity is unaffected, and the change in current or <em>&rho;<sub>cN </sub></em>is disproportionately smaller than that in <em>L<sub>NW</sub></em>, since the tunneling or GR causing these occur over a small region near the junction that is less affected by NW shortening.
1281	<strong>Compression and Shear Behavior </strong><strong>of Ultrathin Coated Nanoporous Gold: A Molecular Dynamics Study</strong>	This paper investigates the compressive and shear properties of nanoporous gold (np-Au) coated with different ultrathin metallic materials (i.e., platinum and silver) via molecular dynamics simulations. Atomistic models used for the geometric representation of coated and uncoated np-Au structures are generated through a new modelling technique, which is based on the Voronoi tessellation method. Three different coating thickness values are used to examine the role of thickness for the coating performance under compressive and shear loading by comparing the mechanical characteristics of the atomistic models such as Young's modulus, yield, and ultimate strengths. Moreover, adaptive common neighbor analyses (aCNA) are carried out by monitoring the evolution of the crystal structure of the specimens during the loading process. In this way, the deformation mechanisms of coated and uncoated nanoporous specimens are identified thoroughly. As a main finding from the simulation results, it is observed that the mechanical properties of np-Au are highly dependent on the type of the coating material. However, a significant improvement on the toughness within the plastic regime is demonstrated for all types of coating materials and loading conditions.

Recently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ~ 15% has been achieved in OSCs by the researchers due to their continuous efforts. Interfacial layer engineering is one of the parameters which plays an important role (electron transport layer, ETL or hole transport layer, HTL) in enhancing the PCE and the stability of OSCs. Hence, tailoring of interfacial layer materials and their impact on the performance of OSCs should be understood in-depth.

1283	Comparing between low F and high Si concentrations influencing on structures, mechanical and tribological properties of diamond-like carbon films	The results obtained from a study of the influence of low F and high Si concentrations on the properties of diamond-like carbon films are reported. The structures of the films were characterized using Auger electron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. The mechanical properties, including adhesion strength, hardness and elastic modulus, were evaluated by scratch and nanoindentation hardness testing. The friction behavior was assessed using ball-on-disk friction testing and optical microscopy. The results indicated that the deposited DLC films contained 0.6-4.9 at.% F and 26.7-39.5 at.% Si. The addition of F and Si to the DLC film affected the growth rate: a decreasing growth trend was observed with increasing F content, and an increasing trend was observed with as the amount of Si in the films increased. The root-mean-square roughness increased when F and Si were doped into DLC films (approximately 2.6 and 1.3 times increased for the F-DLC and Si-DLC films, respectively). However, a decrease of 1.5 times in the hardness and elastic modulus was obtained as F increased in concentration, which was the opposite of the behavior observed in the Si-DLC films with an increase of 1.1 times. This was due to the shifting in the G-peak position. Furthermore, the strong adhesion between the film and the substrate was observed in both the F-DLC and Si-DLC films of approximately 1.2 and 1.4 times compared to the pure DLC film. When measured in ambient air, the addition of Si into the DLC film strongly influenced the friction coefficient, whereas doping with F only slightly influenced the films, as shown by their wear scars. Only a 4.9 at.% F-DLC film exhibited poor mechanical properties, i.e., low hardness and elastic modulus, causing easy peel off and high friction coefficients compared to the results from the DLC film. In addition, the pure DLC, 0.6 at.% F-DLC and 26.7 at.% Si-DLC films showed super low friction coefficients when measured in dry air, as evidenced by their wear scars. Therefore, the addition of low F (0.6 at.%) and high Si (26.7 at.%) concentrations to DLC films can be considered beneficial for improving mechanical and tribological performance.
1284	Electroviscous effect and electrokinetic energy conversion in time periodic pressure-driven flow through a circular nanotube with surface charge-dependent slip	Electroviscous effect and electrokinetic energy conversion efficiency of time periodic pressure-driven flow of incompressible viscous Newtonian liquid through a nanotube with surface charge-dependent slip are studied using a separation of variable technique. Electric potential, velocity and streaming electric field are obtained analytically and further energy conversion efficiency is computed using them. The effects of surface charge-dependent slip and electroviscous effect on velocity and energy conversion efficiency are mainly discussed. The main results show that the velocity amplitude and energy conversion efficiency of the surface charge-dependent flow are reduced compared with those of the surface charge-independent flow.
1285	Food Analysis Employing High Energy Nanosecond Laser and Low Pressure He Ambient Gas	We report the results of an experimental study of food analysis using Nd:YAG nanosecond (ns) laser at various pulse energies in atmospheric ambient air and He ambient gas at different pressures. In contrary to previous results indicating the unfavorable applications of LIBS to food analysis using lower pulse energies and atmospheric ambient air, this study demonstrates clearly the excellent spectral quality obtained from a number of food samples of different hardnesses with high energy (132 mJ) ns laser pulses and 20 Torr He ambient gas. A series of energy dependent intensity measurements show that the intensities generally increase with higher laser energies and harder samples which can be attributed to the generation of stronger shock wave plasma and the subsequently induced He assisted excitation (HAE) mechanism which is responsible for the sharp emission lines and the very low spectral background. Using mochi samples with different Cu impurity contents, this experiment further reveals the existence of a linear calibration line and a detection limit of sub ppm level. The results of this study have thus suggested the promising development of low cost and practical technique for quantitative food analysis in place of more expensive and bulkies picosecond laser used before.
1286	<strong>Characterization of longitudinal acoustic phonons in InGaAsP multi</strong><strong>ple </strong><strong>quantum well</strong><strong>s</strong><strong> by asynchronous optical sampling</strong>	We performed time-resolved reflectivity measurements and characterized the time-varying oscillations of longitudinal acoustic phonons in InGaAsP multiple quantum wells (MQWs) by asynchronous optical sampling with Er-doped fiber lasers. Oscillations of longitudinal acoustic phonons ranging from a few tens to a few hundred gigahertz were observed, which were induced by forward and backward Raman scattering in unfolded and first zone-folded acoustic phonon modes. To characterize the time-varying oscillations of each phonon mode, we analyzed the experimental data with a continuous wavelet transformation. While the oscillations of the first zone-folded acoustic phonons vanished in less than a nanosecond, the oscillations of the unfolded acoustic phonons lasted up to a few nanoseconds, which is more than one order of magnitude longer than the propagation time in the MQW.
1287	<strong>THz Bio-Chemical Sensor </strong>	Optical methods have been essential in the field of chemical and biological analysis, and the terahertz (THz) spectral region has received tremendous attention for its low energy characteristics which allows for non-destructive sensing. However, a major hindrance to terahertz bio-chemical sensing is the large absorption of terahertz radiation in an aqueous environment. Here, we overcome the limitation of high absorption of water in the THz frequency region through experimental demonstration of a metamaterial sensing platform that confines aqueous solution in nanometric volume. Split-ring resonator (SRR) and Fano resonator were selected as typical metamaterial configuration for sensing, and both resonator design exhibit clear resonance in the transmitted THz spectrum under aqueous environment. As a demonstration of chemical sensing, the THz spectra of three alcoholic solutions with different concentrations were measured. Selective adenosine triphosphate (ATP) sensing was demonstrated through ATP-aptamer functionalization on gold metamaterials, where a decrease in the transmittance value was observed as the ATP concentration increased. Hence, the device allows for sensing of chemical and biological samples in aqueous solution in the THz region. The proposed sensing approach have the potential to be an effective tool for molecular analysis through exploiting the advantages offered by THz wave resonant with metamaterials and integrated with nanofluidic technologies.
1288	<strong>Strain Engineering the Structures and Electronic Properties of </strong><strong>Janus Monolayer Transition-metal Dichalcogenides</strong>	Using first-principles calculations, we studied the structure and electronic properties of janus transition-metal dischalcogenides (TMDs) monolayers <em>MXY</em> (<em>M</em> = Mo, W ;<em> X &ne; Y</em> = S, Se, Te). Electronic band structure and density of states calculations reveal that all of the <em>MXY </em>monolayers behavior semiconducting characteristics. Particular attention has been focused on the bandgap engineering by applying <em>in</em>-plane biaxial compressive and tensile strain. Both for tensile and compressive biaxial strains, the shrinking of the energy band-gap of monolayers <em>MXY</em> with increasing level of applied strain is observed. And a semiconductor-to-metal transition can be undergoing at a critical value of strain. The possibility of the tunable energy gap over a wide range makes <em>MXY</em> monolayers potential candidates for nanoelectronics and optoelectronics.
1289	Improving characterization capabilities in new single-photon avalanche diode research	Many novel and promising single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) emerged in recent years. However, some of them may demonstrate a very high dark count rate (DCR), even tens of MHz, especially during development phase or at room temperature, posing new challenges to device characterization. During test of such SPADs, nanosecond gating operation has to be used to eliminate the dark avalanche event not coincident with photon arriving time. However, the fast-gating operation usually induces large fixed-pattern noise, such as spikes with a magnitude over 100mV and possible ringing, making weak avalanche signals difficult to detect. The noise is usually removed (either completely or partially) using various cancellation techniques based on dedicated circuits. Here we present an alternative method and setup to characterize such SPADs. Fast-gating operation is applied and a high-speed digital oscilloscope (DSO) is used to extract the weak avalanche signals from the large noise by waveform subtraction. In this way, the gating width can be down to 1ns or lower while the avalanche detection threshold can be reduced to 5% of the full vertical scale of the DSO or 5mV, whichever is greater. The timing resolution can be better than 2ps for typical avalanche signals. The optical alignment and calibration is easy. The feasibility of on-wafer test with an RF probe station is discussed. All the advantages and features above make this method very useful in new SPAD research.
1290	Voltage controlled sub-THz detection with gated planar asymmetric nanochannels	This letter reports on Self-switching diodes (SSD) fabricated on a AlGaN/GaN heterostructure on Si substrate. By means of free-space measurements at 300 GHz, we demonstrate that the responsivity and noise equivalent power (NEP) of sub-THz detectors based on planar asymmetric nanochannels can be improved and voltage controlled by means of a top gate electrode. A simple quasi-static model based on the DC measurements of the current-voltage curves is able to predict the role of the gate bias on its performance. The best values of voltage responsivity and NEP are achieved when the gate bias approaches the threshold voltage, around 600 V/W and 50 pW/Hz<sup>1/2</sup>, respectively, with a good agreement between modeled results and those obtained from RF measurements under probes at low frequency (900 MHz) and in free-space at 300 GHz.
1291	The origin of optimal sensing temperature in Pt/Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>/MoO<sub>3</sub> Schottky contacted nanobelt straddling heterojunction	Nanostructured Schottky barrier gas sensors have emerged as novel semiconductor devices with large surface areas and unique electronic characteristics. Although it is widely known that operating these gas sensors requires heating to an optimal temperature for the highest sensitivity, the fundamental mechanism that governs the temperature-dependent sensitivity has yet been well understood. In this work, we present new evidence to support that thermionic field emission is the dominant transport mechanism for Schottky contacted nanostructured heterojunction gas sensors at their optimal sensing temperature. Through the fabrication and characterization of Pt/MoO<sub>3</sub> Schottky contacts and Pt/Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>/MoO<sub>3</sub> heterojunctions, we found the previously unreported connection between TFE transport and optimal gas sensing temperature. This connection enables the description of Schottky barrier gas sensing performance using transport theory, which represents a major step towards systematic engineering of nanostructured oxide gas sensors with layered high-<em>k</em> material.
1292	Extending the hierarchical quantum master equation approach to low temperatures and realistic band structures	The hierarchical quantum master equation (HQME) approach is an accurate method to describe quantum transport in interacting nanosystems. It generalizes perturbative master equation approaches by including higher-order contributions as well as non-Markovian memory and allows for the systematic convergence to the numerically exact result. As the HQME method relies on a decomposition of the bath correlation function in terms of exponentials, however, its application to systems at low temperatures coupled to baths with complexer band structures has been a challenge. In this publication, we outline an extension of the HQME approach, which uses a re-summation over poles and can be applied to calculate transient currents at a numerical cost that is independent of temperature and band structure of the baths. We demonstrate the performance of the extended HQME approach for noninteracting tight-binding model systems of increasing complexity as well as for the spinless Anderson-Holstein model.
1293	<strong>Realization of GaN nanostructured ultraviolet photodetector via non-homogeneous Au-GaN interfaces</strong>	We report the fabrication of ultraviolet photodetector based on GaN nanostructures, epitaxially grown on silicon substrate. The surface illustrated GaN nanoislands which lead to a significant enhancement in sensitivity of the device to 1.83&times;10<sup>2</sup> at 13mW in power dependent studies. Whereas, voltage dependent analysis revealed high responsivity and detectivity values of 40.3 mA/W and 5.3&times;10<sup>10</sup> Jones, respectively at 3V. The current&ndash;voltage characteristics revealed inhomogeneous Au-GaN interfaces, responsible for zero-bias operation revealing a self-powered mode with good performance parameters. Additionally, the photoresponse measurement endorsed an effective charge collection by nanoisland networks, leading to a fast rise and fall time constants of 18 and 27 ms, respectively. Such nanostructured GaN photodetector can be employed for energy efficient optoelectronic applications.
1294	<strong>Nanocomposites of Ferroelectric Liquid Crystals and FeCo Nanoparticles: Magnetic Response to the Application of a Small Electric Field </strong>	Nanocomposites of liquid crystals and nanoparticles have been used for a variety of bioapplications using a small applied magnetic field. We explore the use of nanocomposites of ferroelectric liquid crystals and magnetic nanoparticles for their potential to create an internal ordered magnetic field when excited with an applied electric field. Ferroelectric liquid crystals need a small electric field to achieve this. We find out that the concentration of the magnetic nanoparticles facilitates this effect by reducing the switching time and making it constant, which in turn will reduce the rotational viscosity, and hence, the applied electric field. The nanocomposite shows promise as a potential voltage-sensitive contrast agent that may be useful with modalities that can measure local magnetic field changes such as magnetic resonance imaging.
1295	Thermionic cooling efficiency of functionalized carbon nanotube thin films	A large thermionic cooling effect is observed from a functionalized carbon nanotubes cathode surface, and the cooling efficiency, defined as thermionic cooling power as a percentage of total input heating power to the surface, is reported. The cathode consists of a thin tungsten ribbon covered with low work function barium strontium oxide coated carbon nanotubes. It has both a low work function surface and a large Schottky field effect induced by the carbon nanotubes. The combination of the two leads to a strong thermionic emission and hence a relatively large thermionic cooling effect and high cooling efficiency. Detailed measurements of the cathode temperature profiles are presented together with the analysis of the cooling efficiency. The highest cooling efficiency found in this study was 5.9% obtained at 1099 oC cathode temperature and 114.5 mA of thermionic emission current. The dependences of the cooling efficiency on the cathode temperature, and on the emission current are also presented. Prospects of further improvements are discussed as well.
1296	Shear thickening performance of ceria and silica mixed nanoparticles suspension	In this work, the shear thickening (ST) performance of a novel suspension of ceria and silica mixed nanoparticles was systematically studied. Ceria/silica-shear thickening fluids (CeO2/SiO2-STFs) of different concentrations were prepared by using an ultrasonication and mechanical stirring technique. The presence of ceria nanoparticles and their interaction with the SiO2 nanoparticles in the STF were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry. Steady-shear rheological tests showed that distinct rheological behaviors and clear ST effects existed in CeO2/SiO2-STFs with different mass ratios. The viscosity increased from 50.97 (SiO2-STF) to 111.51 Pa&#x2022;s (CeO2/SiO2-STF), and the critical shear rate decreased from 63.09 to 19.95 s-1 when the concentration of the ceria nanoparticles was 12 wt%. An oscillatory dynamic rheological analysis showed that the 12O2/20%SiO2-STF suspension not only had significant energy storage and energy dissipation capacities but also presented excellent elastic behaviors when subjected to low stress and significant energy dissipation under high stress. The results also showed that temperature exerted little influence on the viscosity of the CeO2/SiO2-STF suspension but had a significant influence on the ST effect. Furthermore, the current carried by the CeO2/SiO2-STF suspension increased with the increasing ceria nanoparticle content, indicating improved conductivity. This work provides a novel method for the production of high-performance STFs.
1297	<strong>Negative/Zero Thermal Expansion in Black Phosphorus Nanotubes</strong>	Black phosphorus nanotubes (BPNTs) as new one-dimensional materials have very promising prospects in nanoelectronics devices. Taking into account that the effect of finite temperature on nanoelectronic devices is indispensable, we perform a comprehensive first-principles study of thermal expansion of BPNTs. It is surprisingly found that the negative and zero thermal expansion behaviors can occur in BPNTs. The abnormal thermal expansion can be tunable by changing diameter and bonding in the unique configurations of armchair and zigzag BPNTs. In pristine BPNTs, the size effect appears in armchair nanotubes where the positive thermal expansion (PTE) is weakened generally with increasing diameter. In contrast, the thermal expansion of the zigzag nanotubes is diameter independent. Some zigzag nanotubes exhibit nearly zero thermal expansion (ZTE). For processed BPNTs with changed bonding, both types of nanotubes present negative thermal expansion (NTE) behavior. Differing from the diameter independence of NTE in processed zigzag nanotubes, the NTE in the processed armchair nanotubes is weakened gradually to nearly ZTE with increasing diameter. This work demonstrates that the special characteristics of edge shapes, size and bonding can play crucial roles in determining the abnormal thermal behaviors in BPNTs.
1298	<strong>Determining the polarity of droplet epitaxy grown AlGaN nanorods by piezoresponse force microscopy</strong>	We report a unique methodology for determining the polarity of Al<sub>0.97</sub>Ga<sub>0.03</sub>N nanorods oriented in different crystallographic directions by the non-destructive technique of piezoresponse force microscopy. Al<sub>0.97</sub>Ga<sub>0.03</sub>N nanorods are grown by the plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy technique under extreme group III rich condition. Droplet epitaxy process is employed for the formation of well-faceted nanorods with smooth morphology. The phase formation is investigated by the Raman spectroscopic analysis. Spatial distribution of piezoresponse of Al<sub>0.97</sub>Ga<sub>0.03</sub>N nanorods is mapped, and the polarities of the different crystalline planes of <em>m</em> and <em>c</em> are determined. The corresponding piezoresponse is explained on the basis of spontaneous and induced polarization in a unit cell of the hexagonal crystal, which is further confirmed using piezoresponse spectroscopy. A high value of piezoelectric coefficient, <em>d</em><sub>33 </sub>~ 9.0 pm/V for nanosize Al<sub>0.97</sub>Ga<sub>0.03</sub>N is attributed to the availability of free boundary for volume expansion or contraction at the nanoscale.
1299	Size confinement and origins of two-photon absorption and refraction in CdSe quantum dots	Tuning a semiconductor nanomaterial with large two-photon absorption cross section in the near infrared and investigating the correlation and origins between its size and third-order nonlinear optical properties is very important in possible applications. So in this work, CdSe quantum dots (QDs) with various sizes were successfully prepared, and their size-confined third-order nonlinear optical properties were investigated by Z-scan technique with 100 fs laser pulses at 800 nm wavelength. Both the two-photon absorption and nonlinear refraction were enhanced with size decrease and then weakened with further size decrease. QDs with the diameter of 4.9 nm had the largest susceptibility of 7.8&times;10<sup>-12</sup> esu. The effects of intrinsic dipole moment, photoinduced dipole moment, local electric field and defects in CdSe QDs were discussed.
1300	Absolute cross section for DNA damage induced by low-energy (10 eV) electrons: experimental refinements and sample characterization by AFM	This work describes multiple experimental improvements for measuring absolute cross sections of DNA damage induced by low-energy electrons (LEE) in nanometer-thick films in vacuum. Measurements of such cross sections are particularly sensitive to film thickness and uniformity. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) in 70% ethanol, we present a novel and effective method to determine plasmid DNA film thickness and uniformity that combines height histograms and force-distance curves. We also investigate film deposition with DNA intercalated with 1,3-diaminopropane (Dap) on tantalum-coated substrates as a convenient and cost-effective alternative to the previously-used HOPG substrate. The new substrate permits deposition of films very similar to those formed on the graphite substrate. Using these refinements and further optimizations of the experimental procedure, we measure an absolute cross section of (4.7 {plus minus} 1.5) x10-14 cm2 for conformational damage to a 3197 base-pair plasmid induced by 10 eV electrons, which we believe should be considered as a reference value.
1301	<strong>Heat Transfer Foot Print on Ceramics after Thermal Shock with Droplet Impingement: Development of Thermal Shock Tolerant Material with Hydrophobic Surface</strong>	We perform a systematic study of the thermal shock experienced by the alumina during quenching by cold water droplet impingement with heated surface temperature ranging from 125&deg;C to 475&deg;C for Weber number &asymp;32. We explore the effect of surface heat transfer mode on the thermal shock experienced by the material. It is found that the variation of residual strength translates into the mode of boiling heat transfer, hence surface heat flux. The material remembers the degree of thermal shock; the heat transfer foot print is embedded in the residual strength. This finding speaks to a possibility of developing a ceramic detector for heat transfer modes in extreme environments. This study finds that superior thermal shock tolerance can be achieved by removing the heat transfer footprint with reduced heat flux. By promoting the film boiling with nano-fractal hydrophobic surface, we achieved superior thermal shock tolerance for alumina substrates. This is a novel approach to reduce thermal shock by controlling the heat transfer with surface modification, different from conventional, yet expensive, method of improving the bulk material properties.
1302	The extremely enhanced photocurrent response in the Sb<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>2</sub>Te nanosheet with high conductance	The photocurrent was performed in the Sb<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>2</sub>Te topological insulator with different conductances at a wavelength of 532 nm. The photocurrent is linear with light power intensity, and proportional to the dark current. The higher photocurrent is observed in the nanosheet with higher conductance. The responsivity is proportional to the nanosheet conductance. The responsivity and gain at V=0.1V reaches 731 and 1706 at the nanosheet with conductance of 0.06 S. These are higher than all reported values in (Sb, Bi)<sub>2</sub>(Te, Se)<sub>3</sub> topological insulators, low-dimensional materials and only lower than several reported heterostructure.
1303	Bulk turbostratic graphene deposition on aluminum substrates via high-pressure graphite blasting	This work presents the mechanical exfoliation of graphite into graphene nano-platelets via high pressure blasting onto metallic substrates. After ensuring successful graphene deposition via Raman spectroscopy, the substrates are then tested to detect the enhancement of their thermal, optical and electrochemical properties. The process is facile and straightforward, with no special requirements in terms of energy addition or isolation and is capable of depositing graphene over large surface areas. The application of such approach is suitable for solar thermal absorbers.
1304	<strong>Designing front dielectric and back plasmonic wire grating for efficient light trapping inside perovskite solar cells<sup></sup></strong>	Thin film perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) solar cells have been emerged as good alternatives to conventional silicon solar cells due to their low cost, low fabrication temperature, high carrier collection efficiency, and high-power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the small thickness of perovskite solar cells limits light absorption of the long wavelengths. In this work, we proposed a theoretical design for enhancing light absorption to achieve maximum theoretical photocurrent using front dielectric and back plasmonic wire grating. Using finite element method (FEM) three-dimensional optical model, the optimum size and periodicity of the studied wire grating nanostructures were identified. Additionally, the electrical model revealed a satisfactory enhancement in PCE over that of the planar structure counterpart. The simulation results showed an average enhancement of 22.4% in total generation rate for the entire simulated wavelength, and more than 85% enhancement in narrow-band wavelength compared to the planar structure counterpart
1305	<strong>Quantum Steps in Nano Scale Body SOI-MOSFET as Experimental Probe of Quantum Energy Levels</strong>	In the efforts to address the need of developing ultra-fast computers based on combined electronic and optical signal processing using silicon-based nanoscale devices, new types of transistors have been developed.  Ultra-Thin Body (UTB) and Nano-Scale Body (NSB) SOI-MOSFET devices, sharing a similar W/L but with a channel thickness of respectively 46nm and down to 1.6nm, have been fabricated using a selective Gate-Recessed Channel (GRC) process on the same silicon wafer, and electrically tested at room (300K) and low (77K and 4.7K) temperatures. In addition to the observed drain current values, which were found different by three orders of magnitude, quantum steps have been identified in the NSB transfer curves when measured at low temperatures. Since the NSB device&rsquo;s channel is part of a quantum well structure, the steps can point to discrete levels of energy. Such approach can lead the way to some opportunities towards inter-subband emitting devices. Location of discrete steps is evidence of indirect-to-direct transition in ultra-thin silicon.
1306	Microstructure of Cu<sub>2</sub>S Nanoprecipitates and Its Role as Carrier Bank and Phonon Scattering Center in Thermoelectric Cu<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>0.2</sub>Sn<sub>0.8</sub>S<sub>3</sub> Ceramics	The microstructures of the Cu<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>0.2</sub>Sn<sub>0.8</sub>S<sub>3 </sub>ceramics were investigated by a combination of SAED, HRTEM, EDS and AFM. The metastable Cu<sub>2</sub>S nanoprecipitates show clear orientation relationships with the matrix that the plates align with three crystal axes of cubic lattice. KPFM and CAFM reveals that the nanoprecipitates have much lower potential than the matrix to promote electrical properties. A mechanism of phonon scattering is proposed based on the effects of the occupation disorder of Cu atoms in Cu<sub>2</sub>S nanopercipitates, coherent heterointerfaces between Cu<sub>2</sub>S and matrix, and the extended strain field in the matrix regions adjacent to the Cu<sub>2</sub>S nanoprecipitates.
1307	Research on the selective adhesion characteristics of polydimethylsiloxane layer	Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a widely used inexpensive, non-toxic material which has many advantages. But it is generally considered that PDMS does not adhere to the other substrates without the special treatments due to its low surface energy. However, in this paper, it is the first time that we found that the PDMS adhered on the silicon dioxide substrate to form an adhesive layer only by the routine cast molding process. The mechanism of the PDMS adhesion on the silicon dioxide substrate during the process was illustrated in detail. The smooth, thin, transparent, hydrophobic and selective PDMS adhesion layer can be used as a functional coating to improve the special performances of the micro/nano devices. Finally, as an example, a facile approach is proposed to realize the superhydrophobic surfaces by combining the SiO2 microstructure with the PDMS adhesion layer.
1308	<strong>Charge transfer induced anomalous magnetic behavior in 2D &alpha;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanosheets grown on Graphene surface</strong>	To overcome the detrimental effect of charge transfer from transition metal to 2D substrates like graphene we have grown ultrathin antiferromagnetic &alpha;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layers on graphene surface. Anomalous magnetic behavior viz. both coercivity and exchange bias increase with increasing temperature with strong ferromagnetic ordering. The highest values of coercivity and giant exchange bias are obtained as 3335 Oe and 2361Oe respectively. Giant enhancement (646%) in exchange bias is observed with increase in temperature from 2K to 70K. Interlayer exchange coupling which also increases with increasing temperature becomes strongest at 300K to achieve ultra-low coercivity of 22 Oe by growing &alpha;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> phase on both sides of graphene surface. Maximum 32% negative magnetoresistance is observed as a result of exchange bias which changes with temperature. All these results are explained on the basis of charge transfer effect at the interface of graphene/&alpha;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> at low temperature region and spin canting effect of surface spins at higher temperature region. Theoretical support using first principle calculation is also provided to understand the interface interaction, quantitative evaluation of charge transfer and density of states.
1309	Enhanced bremsstrahlung X-ray emission from Ag nanoparticles irradiated by ultrashort laser pulses	Ag nanoparticles flowing through a thin water jet are irradiated by femtosecond laser pulses to produce bremsstrahlung X-rays of up to 100 keV energy. The jet ensures long-term stability of nanoparticles during laser irradiation. A 30-fold enhancement is observed in the X-ray yield compared to the precursor salt solution, owing to the enhanced multiphoton ionization resulting from surface plasmon assisted local field enhancement. A lower 18-fold enhancement is measured in Au nanoparticles under identical conditions. The relatively lower ionization potential of Ag nanoparticles makes them better suited for X- ray generation, with variety of applications including dynamics studies, microscopy, and lithography.
1310	<strong>Angle dependent localized surface plasmon resonance from silver nanoparticles embedded in SiO<sub>2</sub> thin film</strong>	<SPAN style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 150%;">Near surface silver nanoparticles embedded in silicon oxide were obtained by 40 keV silver negative ion implantation without the requirement of an annealing step. Ion beam induced local heating within the film leads to an exo-diffusion of the silver ions towards the film surface resulting in the protrusion of larger nanoparticles. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (XTEM) reveals the presence of poly-disperse nanoparticles (NPs), ranging between 2 nm-20 nm, at different depths of the SiO<sub>2</sub> film. The normal incidence reflectance spectrum shows a double kink feature in the vicinity of 400nm, indicating a strong localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) from the embedded NPs. However, due to overlap of the bilayer interference and LSPR, the related features are difficult to separate. The ambiguity in associating the correct kink with the LSPR related absorption is cleared with the use of transfer matrix simulations in combination with an effective medium approximation. The simulations are further verified with angle dependent reflectance measurements. Additionally, transfer matrix simulation is also used to calculate the electric field intensity profile through the depth of the film, wherein an enhanced electric field intensity is predicted at the surface of the implanted films.</SPAN>
1311	Spin-current diodes based on germanene and stanene subjected to local exchange fields	We propose and demonstrate a spin-current diode based on germanene and stanene nanoribbons. The results reveal that the germanene or stanene nanoribbon simultaneously under x- and z-direction local exchange fields exhibits excellent rectification characteristics, and that the spin current is blocked in a certain range of spin voltage. The proposed spin-current diodes have three main features: (1) the breakdown voltage of the diodes can be controlled by the strength of exchange fields; (2) the polarity direction of the diodes can be reversed just by adjusting the direction of local exchange fields; and (3) the spin diode effects can be well maintained at 300 K room temperature. All of the results indicate that the proposed germanene and stanene nanosystems are promising candidates for spintronic devices.
1312	<strong>The frequency dependence of hysteresis behaviors in columnar-grained BaTiO<sub>3</sub> nano films</strong>	By taking into account the effects of the epitaxial strain, the influence of defects, the low-permittivity surface layer and the grain boundary, a phase-field model is developed to investigate the influence of loading frequency on the ferroelectric properties of columnar-grained BaTiO<sub>3</sub> nano films. The results showed that the hysteresis response consists of two phases. In the low-frequency phase, the electrical polarizations are observed to follow closely with the variation of electric filed, causing a complete 180&deg; polar reversal. As the frequency increases within this phase, the remnant polarization increases slightly and the coercive field exhibits a sharper increase, while the dielectric constant and piezoelectric constant decrease severely. In the high-frequency phase, a higher loading speed leaves less time for the electric dipole to fully rotate, leading to a less switched state. The remnant polarization decreases with increasing frequency. The coercive field, the dielectric constant and the piezoelectric constant exhibit a frequency-insensitive effect at higher frequencies.
1313	<strong>INVESTIGATIONS ON STRUCTURAL AND OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF CHALCONE DENDRIMER IN Ag@TiO<sub>2</sub> CORE-SHELL NANOPARTICLES</strong>	The main focus of this research article is to observe the contributions of chalcone dendrimer in Ag@TiO<sub>2</sub> core shell nanoparticles. The samples were synthesized by Redox transmetalation method. The structure of the samples in three molar ratio viz.1:1, 1:2, 1:5 (noted as A,B,C) with Poly Vinyl Pyrolidine (PVP) as stabilizing agent were compared with the sample Ag@TiO<sub>2</sub> of 1:2 molar ratio (noted as D) using chalcone dendrimer as stabilizing agent. The prepared samples were structurally characterized by XRD and HRTEM analysis. The XRD and SAED analysis exhibited tetragonal body centered crystal structure with <em>d</em><sub>hkl </sub>= 1.6 &Aring;, 2.4 &Aring; and 3.4 &Aring;. The lattice parameters were calculated for all the samples and the variations observed were reported. The grain size and dislocation density of the synthesized nanoparticles were calculated using Debye-Scherrer formula. From Williamson &ndash; Hall plot, it was identified that the effect of lattice strain was limited in sample D in which chalcone dendrimer acted as stabilizing agent. The structural investigation showed the impact of stabilizing agent on the surface elements. Similarly, the optical characteristics were discussed based on UV-DRS and Photo luminescence studies. Using Kubelka-Munk function, the band gap energy was calculated and the difference observed in the band gap energy due to the impact of stabilizing agents on metal-metaloxide (Ag@TiO<sub>2</sub>) combination was analysed. The molar absorptivity (&epsilon;) was calculated for all the samples using Beer-Lambert&rsquo;s law and the difference in absorbance on using different capping agent was discussed.
1314	Nanoscale investigation of Si nanoribbon growth on Ag(110)	We present a nanoscale investigation by means of scanning tunneling microscopy of Si nanostructure growth on the anisotropic silver (110) surface, in the submonolayer range. Four types of Si nanostructures are studied statistically as a function of the substrate temperature in the range 300 K to 500 K: isolated single- and double nanoribbons, which differ only by a factor of two in their width, and their respective bi-dimensional counterparts in the self-assembly regime. Our observations highlight different growth regimes controlled by kinetics. Below 320 K, the Si adatoms diffuse along the easy [11 &#x0305;0] direction, forming essentially isolated single nanoribbons randomly distributed on the silver terraces. At higher temperatures, transverse diffusion along the [001] direction is activated and a competition between the growth of self-assembled single nanoribbons and isolated double nanoribbons is observed. Above 440 K, a transition from one- to two-dimensional double nanoribbons growth is evidenced. At 490 K, the Si deposition results in the formation of massively self-assembled double nanoribbons. Based on Arrhenius analyses, activation barriers are found to be (125 {plus minus} 15) meV and (210 {plus minus} 20) meV for the formation of isolated Si nanoribbons and self-assembled Si double nanoribbons, respectively. Our results allow for a better understanding of the kinetic limiting processes which determine the submonolayer morphology and illustrate the role played by the missing row reconstruction of the Ag(110) surface in the formation of extended Si nanoribbon arrays.
1315	Quadrature squeezing of the mechanical mode in a superconducting electromechanical system	We propose a scheme for realizing quadrature squeezing of the mechanical mode in a superconducting electromechanical system. The system is composed of a superconducting transmission line resonator(STLR) and a superconducting quantum interference device(SQUID). The SQUID acts as the qubit and a nanomechanical resonator(NAMR) is fabricated as one part of the SQUID. Under the large detuning condition, we use the Fr&ouml;hlich-Nakajima transformation to eliminate the qubit and obtain an effective Hamiltonian for the STLR and the NAMR. Our results show that a squeezing effect can occur in the NAMR and the squeezing degree can be adjusted by controlling the strength of the driving field and the dissipation ratio of the system. One of the most notable features of our results is the universality, i.e., the results only depend on a few scaled quantities, not on too many parameters.
1316	Magnetic tunneling with CNT-based metamaterial	Multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) fabricated by chemical vapor deposition contain magnetic nanoparticles. While increasing frequency of electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure (up to &lt;10 kHz) of MWCNTs resulted in slight induced magnetization decrease due to skin effect of the conducting carbon, higher frequencies (&gt;10 kHz) demonstrated an exponential magnetization increase. Furthermore, this magnetization increase is stronger for the EMF fields with decreasing amplitude (less than 0.5 A/m for 512 kHz). This observation reveals a possibility of magnetic tunneling in MWCNTs (change of magnetic state of blocked magnetic moments). This interpretation is supported by observation of unblocking larger magnetic remanence (MR) portion from MWCNTs with progressively smaller amplitude of oscillating magnetic field.
1317	<strong>Vibration suppression of doublewalled carbon nanotubes </strong><strong>in the terahertz range</strong>	Inspirited by locally resonant microstructure of metamaterials, the role of counter-phase intertube vibration in metamaterial-like vibration behavior of DWCNTs (doublewalled carbon nanotubes) is investigated. It is shown that unlike elastic metamaterials characterized by wavelength-independent effective mass, &ldquo;effective mass&rdquo; of a DWCNT in flexural vibration depends on wavelength. In spite of the non-existence of the &ldquo;bandgap&rdquo; (within which effective mass is negative for all wavelengths), our results indicated that forced vibration of a DWCNT driven by an applied periodic force is largely suppressed when the applied exciting frequency approaches or exceeds (but not exactly identical to) the lowest intertube resonant frequency in the terahertz range. This result suggests that the counter-phase intertube vibration (between the inner and outer tubes) stimulated at terahertz frequencies has a significant effect to suppress forced vibration of MWCNTs (multiwalled carbon nanotubes), and MWCNTs can exhibit metamaterial-like vibration behavior in the terahertz range. This conclusion may provide useful insights into vibration controlling of MWCNTs at terahertz frequencies.
1318	High-performance small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) experiments on a multi-functional laboratory goniometer platform with easily exchangeable X-ray modules	Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is a well-established, versatile technique for the analysis of nanoscale structures and dimensions e.g. in liquid dispersions, thin solid objects or powder samples. When combined with wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) complementary information about the atomic structure can be obtained. SAXS experiments traditionally require dedicated instruments to achieve the desired angular resolution, sensitivity, stability and speed of measurement. Here we demonstrate how a multi-functional laboratory goniometer platform, as widely being used for powder X-ray diffraction and for a variety of related techniques, can be configured with pre-aligned X-ray modules that enable advanced SAXS/WAXS experiments, without compromising the exceptional versatility of the instrument. Line and point collimation setups, as well as quick and easy switching between them, are readily possible. Key components are a detachable, evacuated beam path and a high-resolution, low-noise hybrid pixel area detector, in combination with a hardware interface design that allows to configure the instrument with different X-ray modules without the need for re-alignment. Software for SAXS data reduction and analysis was developed. The good SAXS/WAXS performance and the derived analytical results were verified on various test samples, such as gold nanoparticles, colloidal silica, liposomes, dilute protein solutions and solid polymer samples. It is believed that this novel approach to SAXS/WAXS instrumentation will help to make this powerful structure analysis technique more widely accessible and affordable for multi-user laboratories.
1319	<strong>Suction/injection process and thermal radiation impacts on magneto-hydrodynamic squeezing nanofluid flow and heat transfer between parallel disks considering Joule heating</strong>	In this paper, the unsteady squeezing flow and heat transfer of magneto-hydrodynamic nanofluid between two parallel disks under a suction/blowing process are studied. Thermal radiation, Joule heating and viscous dissipation impacts are considered. The researchers first converted the boundary conditions and governing momentum/energy equations into a non-dimensional form and solved them with DRA (Duan Rach Approach). Unlike ADM (Adomin Decomposition Method), this method permits us to discover an analytical solution without applying a numerical procedure to compute the missing parameters. The water based nanofluid is comprised of copper, copper oxide and alumina. The impacts of different parameters such as the suction/blowing parameter, the magnetic parameter, the solid volume fraction, the squeeze number, and the radiation parameter on flow and heat transfer attributes are investigated. Moreover, the value of the Nusselt number is calculated and illustrated in figures. The outcomes demonstrate that the fluid velocity ascends with the rise of the suction parameter while the temperature profile descends with the ascendance of the suction parameter.
1320	Letter: Molecular Diffusion Replaces Capillary Pumping in Phase-Change Driven Nanopumps	Inspired by the capillary driven heat transfer devices, we present a phase-change driven nanopump operating almost isothermally. Meticulous computational experiments on different sized nanopumps revealed efficient operation of the pump despite the reduction in system size that extinguishes capillary pumping by annihilating the liquid meniscus structures. Measuring the density distribution of liquid near evaporating and condensing liquid/vapor interfaces, we discovered that phase-change induced molecular scale mass diffusion mechanism replaces the capillary pumping in the absence of meniscus structures. Therefore, proposed pumps can serve as a part of both nanoelectromechanical (NEMS) and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) with similar working efficiencies.
1321	<strong>Transverse Piezoresistance Behaviors </strong><strong>of N-doped 3<em>C</em>-SiC</strong> <strong>Nanobelts with Selected(1-10) </strong><strong>Top Surface</strong>	<strong>Abstract</strong> The piezoresistive effect of SiC low-dimensional nanostructures, together with their exclusive benefits of superior mechanical properties and could be integrated into the flexible devices that can withdraw large strain, promise to enable a wide range of sensing devices application possible in the harsh working conditions. In this work, we reported the transverse piezoresistance behaviors of <em>n</em>-type 3<em>C</em>-SiC nanobelts with selected  top surface and N dopants. The single-crystalline SiC nanobelts were synthesized <em>via</em> direct pyrolysis of polymeric precursors without catalysts, which had an average N doping level of ~6.02<em> at</em>.% and a typical width-to-thickness ratio of ~8. It was disclosed that the transverse piezoresistance coefficient  reached the maximum 10.29&times;10<sup>-11</sup> Pa<sup>-1</sup> at a fixed external stress of 67.03 <em>n</em>N. Correspondingly, the gauge factor (GF) was calculated to be of ~61.7, which was higher than those of <em>n</em>-type SiC materials ever reported. The results revealed that present <em>n</em>-type SiC nanobelts have the potential of becoming an outstanding contestant for building robust pressure sensors with elevated sensitivities.
1322	Evidence of Converse Magnetoelectric Interactions Observed in Sol-gel derived thin films of PLZT and CZFO using Magnetic Force Microscopy	This work focus on an investigation of the reverse magnetoelectric interactions observed using Magnetic Force Microscopy. The layered nano composite films of Pb<sub>0.93</sub>La<sub>0.07</sub>Zr<sub>0.6</sub>Ti<sub>0.4</sub>O<sub>3   </sub>(PLZT) and Co<sub>0.9</sub>Zn<sub>0.1</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (CZFO) were obtained using sol-gel derived spin coating route. The composite structure so obtained was subjected to an external DC voltage  0V, &plusmn;2V, &plusmn; 5V and MFM topography, phase angle and intensity contrasts were recorded. MFM images show a noticeable change in the phase contrast as well as other image parameters as a function of an external DC electric field which is a signature of converse magnetoelectric interactions.
1323	Hot-carrier-mediated impact excitation of Er<sup>3+</sup> ions in SiO<sub>2</sub> sensitized by Si nanocrystals	Past research has shown that indirect excitation of Er<sup>3+</sup> ions in SiO<sub>2</sub> solid-states<p>matrix with Si nanocrystals can be achieved by different pathways. Here, we investigate the impact excitation mechanisms in detail by means of time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. We explicitly demonstrate that the free carrier impact excitation mechanism is activated as soon as the carriers obtain sufficient excess energy. The &ldquo;hot&rdquo; carriers with the above-threshold energy can be created upon optical pumping in two ways: either upon absorption of (i) a single photon with an energy exceeding a certain threshold hv &gt; E<sub>th</sub>, or (ii) following absorption of multiple photons of lower energy in a single nanocrystal, hv &lt; E<sub>th</sub>, followed by an Auger recombination of the generated multiple e-h pairs. In addition, we show that the impact excitation dynamics by hot carriers are similar, regardless of the mode in which they have been created.
1324	<strong>Selective electric field assisted dissolution as a technique for micro and nano structuring of metal thin films</strong>	A novel technique for patterning compact thin metal layers is presented. The technique is based on a successive application of well known, cost-effective and simple methods of glass poling and electric field assisted dissolution. A microstructure from the patterned anode, was successfully copied onto a thin silver layer on a glass substrate. It is demonstrated that electric field assisted dissolution can be used for selective dissolution of compact metal layers. Nanostructuring of compact metal layers is interesting as it can be used in the production of metamaterials, metasurfaces and optical circuits. Proposed two-step technique does not involve expensive equipment and the duration of the structuring process is independent of the size of the required structured surface.
1325	Visualization of nanocrystalline CuO in the grain boundaries of Cu<sub>2</sub>O thin films and effect on band bending and film resistivity	Direct evidence for the presence of a CuO structure in the grain boundaries of Cu<sub>2</sub>O thin films is provided by high resolution automated phase and orientation mapping (ASTAR), which was not detectable by classical transmission electron microscopy techniques. Conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) revealed that the CuO causes a local loss of current rectification at the Schottky barrier between the C-AFM tip and Cu<sub>2</sub>O. The suppression of CuO formation at the Cu<sub>2</sub>O grain boundaries is identified as the key strategy for future device optimization.
1326	<SPAN style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: windowtext;">Effect of coconut shell on the performance of beta-silicon carbide reinforced conducting polymer composites</SPAN>	This study aims to investigate the effect of using the combination of coconut shell (CS) particles and beta-silicon carbide (&beta;-SiC) nanoparticles as reinforcement in the conducting polymer composites. The elemental composition, physical characterization, impact strength, water absorption and dielectric properties of the composites were studied. Chemical composition analysis reveals that the lignocellulosic CS is made up with 48.37% carbon, 6.313% hydrogen, 1.20% nitrogen, 0.306% of sulfur and 43.391% of oxygen. Presence of macroporous structure was detected on irregular CS particles size with porosity ranging from 870.9 nm &ndash; 1.6 &mu;m. The increase of the amorphization in the conducting polymer composites contributed by the CS particles increased the dielectric loss factor and electrical losses but decreased the impact strength. The incorporation of CS particles in the conducting polymer composites had a positive influence on the dielectric constant <em>&epsilon;</em>&rsquo;, dielectric loss factor <em>&epsilon;&rdquo; </em>and electrical conductivity <em>&sigma;</em>, contributed by the heterogeneous nature of the composites with overall polarizability arises from atomic, electronic and orientation polarizations.

1328	Review of hydro-instability experiments with alternate capsule supports in indirect- drive implosions on the National Ignition Facility	Hydrodynamic instability growth of capsule support membranes (or "tents") has been recognized as one of the major contributors to the performance degradation in high- compression plastic capsule implosions at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) [E. M. Campbell, R. Cauble, and B. A. Remington, AIP Conf. Proc. 429, 3 (1998)]. The capsules were supported by tents because the nominal 10-um diameter fill tubes were not strong enough to support capsules by themselves in indirect-drive implosions on NIF. After it was recognized that the tents had a significant impact of implosion's stability, new alternative support methods were investigated. While some of these methods completely eliminated tent, other concepts still used tents but concentrated on mitigating their impact. The tent-less methods included "fishing pole" reinforced fill tubes, cantilevered fill tubes, and thin-wire "tetra cage" supports. In the "fishing pole" concept, a 10-um fill tube was inserted inside 30-um fill tube for extra support with the connection point located 300 um away from the capsule surface. The cantilevered fill tubes were supported by 12-um thick SiC rods, offset by up to 300 um from the capsule surfaces. In the "tetra-cage" concept, 2.5-um thick wires (carbon nanotube yarns) were used to support a capsule. Other concepts used "polar tents" and a "foam-shell" to mitigate effects of the tents. The "polar tents" had significantly reduced contact area between the tents and the capsule compared to the nominal tents. In the "foam-shell" concept, 200-um thick, a 30 mg/cc SiO2 foam layer was used to offset the tents away from the capsule surface in an attempt to mitigate their effects. These concepts were investigated in x-ray radiography experiments and compared with perturbations from standard tent support. The measured perturbations in the "fishing pole", cantilevered fill tube, and "tetra-cage" concepts compared favorably with (were smaller than) nominal tent perturbations and were recommended for further testing for feasibility in layered DT implosions. The "polar tents" were tested in layered DT implosions with a relatively- stable "high-foot" drive showing an improvement in neutron yield in one experiment compared to companion implosions with nominal tents. This article reviews and summarizes recent experiments on these alternate capsule support concepts. In addition, the concept of magnetic levitation is also discussed.
1329	Reversible nanomagnetic effects exhibited by multiscale ion-implanted platinum in silica glass recorded by an ultrafast two-wave mixing	Nanomagnetization exhibited by multiscale platinum (Pt) structures embedded by ion-implantation in silica plates was studied. An interferometrically-controlled laser irradiation was carried out in the plasmonic samples to induce periodic linear arrangements of Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs) dispersed in the surrounding of microstructures integrated by SiO<sub>2</sub> and Pt. The topographical and magnetic effects on the sample surface were analyzed by atomic force microscopy in contact-quasistatic mode, non-contact dynamic mode (AC-mode) and its respective magnetic force mode (MFM). The magnetic polarization of the multiscale Pt-based structures was further tuned with a Neodymium magnet contact procedure. MFM measurements indicated that gradient phase-shift (<em>&#x2206;</em><em>&theta;</em>) and the corresponding gradient force (<em>&part;Fz</em>/<em>&part;z</em>) were stronger at an embedded Pt-based structure magnetic shape. This process correspond to the first controlled method toward the development of multiscale plasmonic structures based on laser-induce bimodal nanoparticles distribution. Moreover, increase in compactness of the structure was further confirmed by a heightening of about 5 GPa in effective elastic modulus, <em>E</em><sub><em>eff</em></sub>, for the case of silica glass-PtNPs, against silica glass. The studied nanostructure composite behavior promises immediate applications for developing endurable high-density data storage devices. <SPAN style="color: #000000; font-family: CMR10; font-size: 9pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal;"><SPAN style="color: #000000; font-family: CMR7; font-size: 6pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal;"><SPAN style="color: #000000; font-family: CMMI10; font-size: 9pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal;"><br /></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN>
1330	Resistive switching behaviors mediated by grain boundaries in one longitudinal Al/MoS<sub>2</sub>&amp;PVP/ITO device	Nonvolatile memory devices based on 2D layered transition metal dichalcogenides have inspired tremendous amounts of research interests in recent years. In this work, resistive switching (RS) devices based on hybrid molybdenum disulphide and Polyvinylpyrrolidone (MoS<sub>2</sub>&amp;PVP) is explored. One longitudinal Al/MoS<sub>2</sub>&amp;PVP/ITO device exhibits three different modes of I-V characteristics, i.e. typical bipolar RS (TBRS), asymmetrical bipolar RS (ABRS) and threshold switching (TS), which can be explained by the formation and rupture of conducting filaments (CFs) consisting of sulfur vacancy filaments in MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflakes and sulfur ions filaments in PVP. These CFs form from three different kinds of grain boundaries (GBs), intersecting-GB, bisecting-GB, and bridge-GB in which GBs attach one electrode, parallel to the two electrodes, and attach both electrodes, respectively, corresponding to the three modes of I-V characteristics. These three kinds of GBs coexist in one device and the CF forms randomly from one kind of them during sweeping loops. The mechanism was experimentally proved by our results of the increasing probability of TBRS in device with one layer of PVP thin film inserted into the interface of MoS<sub>2</sub>&amp;PVP and ITO and other researchers&rsquo; results in all-surface MoS<sub>2</sub> single-layer MoS<sub>2</sub> devices.
1331	The interfacial stability and electronic properties of Ag/M (M=Ni, Cu, W and Pd) and Cu/Cr interfaces	The work of separation (<em>W</em><sub>sep</sub>), interface energy (<em>&gamma;<sub>i</sub></em><sub>nt</sub>) and electronic properties of Ag/M (M=Ni, Cu, W and Pd) and Cu/Cr interfaces are systematically studied by using first-principles calculation. Three criteria including <em>W</em><sub>sep</sub>, <em>&gamma;<sub>i</sub></em><sub>nt</sub> and<sub> </sub>quantum conductivity (<em>G</em>) have been proposed for the suitable electrical contact materials. The results indicate that Ag(111)/Ni(111), Ag(100)/W(100) and Ag(111)/W(110) interfaces have comparatively larger <em>W</em><sub>sep</sub> and lower positive <em>&gamma;<sub>i</sub></em><sub>nt</sub> among all the interfaces, which demonstrates that Ag/Ni and Ag/W interfaces are more suitable as nano-multilayer electrical contact materials than other interfaces. Moreover, Ag(111)/Ni(111) interface has the largest <em>G</em> and the best dispersing arc ability among these three interfaces, and thus it is chosen as the best candidate for the interface of nano-multilayer electrical contact material.
1332	Superconducting NanoJosephson Junctions Patterned with a Focused Helium Ion Beam	We report the fabrication of nano scale wires and Josephson junctions in 25 nm thick YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7&minus;;&delta;</sub> thin films with wire widths as narrow as 50 nm. Our approach utilizes a finely focused gas field ion source from a helium ion microscope to directly modify the material on the nanometer scale to convert irradiated regions of the film into insulators. In this manner the film remains intact and no material is milled or removed. Transport data shows that the electrical properties: critical current and conductance scale linearly with the<br />lithographically defined width ensuring that the actual dimensions are commensurate. We observe that the critical current and voltage state resistance of the junctions is nearly temperature also demonstrate the ability<br />to fabricate hysteric underdamped junctions by using this process to create devices exhibiting high resistance and capacitance. This patterning technique allows for a broad range of electrical properties for Josephson devices that will expand potential applications.
1333	<strong>Magnetoelectric Spin-Glass Transition(s) in Pure and Disordered BiFeO<sub>3</sub></strong><sub></sub>	We present here the results of a comparative study of the spin glass (SG) transition in pure and 20% BaTiO<sub>3</sub> substituted BiFeO<sub>3</sub>. It is shown that the anomalous frequency dependence of ac susceptibility in the SG phase of BiFeO<sub>3</sub> is not linked with the spin cycloid as it is present even after its destruction in 20% BaTiO<sub>3</sub> substituted BiFeO<sub>3</sub>. Our neutron scattering studies reveal the presence of long-range ordered (LRO) antiferromagnetic (AFM) peak and decrease in the ordered magnetic moment at the SG transition temperature suggesting that some spin components are getting detached from the AFM phase. Further, the SG transition is accompanied with anomalies in unit cell volume and ferroelectric polarization around the SG transition temperature, highlighting the presence of magnetoelastic and magnetoelectric couplings, respectively. All these results suggest that the SG phase of BiFeO<sub>3</sub> is intrinsic to the system and is not due to nano-sized impurities.
1334	<strong>Vanadium Nitride-decorated lotus root-like NCNFs as 3D current collector for Li-S batteries</strong>	In the present study, a facile strategy to construct 3D vanadium nitride (VN)-decorated lotus root-like N-doping carbon nanofibers (VN-NCNFs) as current collector with stable electrochemical performance for Li-S batteries was described. The polar conductive VN with catalytic property provides chemical adsorption to trap lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and enhances the transformation of LiPSs. The Li-S batteries with as-prepared VN-NCNFs current collector display stable cycling performance with a capacity of 700 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> after 500 cycles at 0.2 C.s<p><strong> </strong>
1335	Photodynamics of reconfigurable two-dimensional polar wetting sheets of a dendrimer	We report an unusual reversible interfacial wetting-dewetting switching of a dendrimer incorporating azobenzene moieties. The switching is accompanied by light-driven generation/extinction processes of the surface wetting nanostructures, which are composed of supramolecular polarly layered molecules. The photoswitching allows macroscopic wetting/dewetting and nonlinear optical responses. Our results provide unique insights into controlling transient structures of photoresponsive materials.
1336	<strong>Hierarchical nanostructure of CrCoNi film underlying its remarkable mechanical strength</strong>	A CrCoNi medium entropy alloy thin film is developed using magnetron sputtering. It contains unique hierarchical nanostructures, featuring (1) a high density of planar defects (i.e., stacking faults and twin boundaries), (2) nanometre-sized dual phase (face-centred-cubic and hexagonal-close-packed) crystals, and (3) vertically aligned nano-columns, each with a width of ~ 100 nm. The hierarchical nanostructures in this study are novel and interesting, especially the dual phase structure, since the bulk CrCoNi medium entropy alloy generally presents the face-centred-cubic structure. The CrCoNi film shows a hardness quadruple that of its face-centred-cubic structured counterpart, while maintaining a considerable damage resistance. The role of the hierarchical nanostructure in producing such mechanical responses is discussed.
1337	Spectrally resolved X-ray beam induced current in a single InGaP nanowire	We demonstrate electrically detected X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS) using a 65 nm beam in single n+-i-n+ doped nanowire devices. The X-ray beam induced current (XBIC) and the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) signals were detected simultaneously as a function of the excitation energy near the Ga K absorption edge at 10.37 keV. The spectra show similar oscillations around the edge, which shows that the XBIC is limited by the primary absorption. Our results reveal the feasibility of the XBIC detection mode for the XAFS investigation in nanostructured devices.
1338	Polyaniline (C<sub>3</sub>N) nanoribbons: Magnetic metal, Semiconductor, and Half-Metal	Two-dimensional polyaniline sheet has been recently synthesized and found that it is a semiconductor with<br />indirect band gap. Polyaniline nanoribbons decomposed from two-dimensional polyaniline sheet (C<sub>3</sub>N sheet)<br />are investigated using density functional theory. The existence of nitrogen atoms in the edge of the ribbons<br />increases stability and magnetization of the ribbons and make them different from graphene nanoribbons.<br />Unsaturated nanoribbons are magnetic metals so that armchair C3N nanoribbons are gap-less spin semicon-<br />ductors in the antiferromagnetic state and half-metals in the ferromagnetic state. A transition from metal<br />to semiconductor is observed in the armchair C3N nanoribbons when the edge atoms are passivated by hy-<br />drogen. The band gap of hydrogen saturated armchair C<sub>3</sub>N nanoribbons can be controlled using an external<br />transverse electric field so that its magnitude is dependent on the direction of the electric field. Being metal<br />or semiconductor in hydrogen saturated zigzag C<sub>3</sub>N nanoribbons is strongly dependent on the edge atoms so<br />that just ribbons having nitrogen atoms in both edges are semiconductor. An external electric field cannot<br />induce any spin polarization in the zigzag nanoribbons which is in contrast with what was observed in zigzag<br />graphene nanoribbons.
1339	Ion Movement in Thin Nafion Films Under an Applied Electric Field	The electromechanical response of Nafion films with and without an ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) ([emim]Tf<sub>2</sub>N) additive were characterized under an applied electric field <em>in situ</em> using neutron reflectometry (NR) and voltage modulated atomic force microscopy (VM-AFM). NR showed that pure Nafion films exhibited no response under field strengths of ~0.5 V/&micro;m while VM-AFM measurements showed a minimal response at higher field strengths (~200 V/&micro;m), which is ascribed to residual water presence in the films. The addition of ionic liquid resulted in clear electroresponsiveness seen in both NR and VM-AFM. NR results indicated mass migration away from the cathodic interface driven by [emim]<sup>+</sup> movement in the direction of the electric field.  The lack of ionic liquid accumulation at the electrode interfaces, contrasts bulk electromechanical behavior of similar systems reported in the literature. VM-AFM measurements were able to resolve the relative contributions of the [emim]<sup>+</sup> cation and Tf<sub>2</sub>N<sup>-</sup> anion to film deformation by alternating the direction of the applied field, and support the [emim]<sup>+</sup> dominant migration seen in the NR results. The findings presented here emphasize the need for nanoscale analysis of material properties of electroresponsive thin film systems and demonstrate the potential for probing electric field effects using <em>in situ</em> techniques.
1340	Tuning and Stabilization of Optomechanical Crystal Cavities Through NEMS Integration	Nanobeam optomechanical crystals, in which localized GHz frequency mechanical modes are coupled to wavelength-scale optical modes, are being employed in a variety of experiments across different material platforms. Here, we demonstrate the electrostatic tuning and stabilization of such devices, by integrating a Si3N4 slot mode optomechanical crystal cavity with a nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) element, which controls the displacement of an additional "tuning" beam within the optical near-field of the optomechanical cavity. Under DC operation, tuning of the optical cavity wavelength across several optical linewidths with little degradation of the optical quality factor (Q ~ 10^5) is observed. The AC response of the tuning mechanism is measured, revealing actuator resonance frequencies in the 10 MHz to 20 MHz range, consistent with the predictions from simulations. Feedback control of the optical mode resonance frequency is demonstrated, and alternative actuator geometries are presented.
1341	Low field manifestation of spiral ordering in sheet like BiFeO<sub>3</sub> nanostructures	Magnetic phase diagram of a material could be tuned through structural modification. Here we show significant lowering of magnetic field (H<sub>i</sub>) required from transition from cycloidal to canted antiferromagnetic state in sheet like nanostructures of BiFeO<sub>3</sub>, in comparison to reported bulk single crystals of BiFeO<sub>3</sub>. Structural analysis of this sheet like nanostructured BFO suggests that there is<br />more tilting in FeO<sub>6</sub> octahedra that reduces Fe-O-Fe distance in comparison to bulk BFO, leading to decrease in H<sub>i</sub> through the reduction of exchange interaction strength.
1342	Overcoming device unreliability with continuous learning in a population coding based computing system	The brain, which uses redundancy and continuous learning to overcome the unreliability of its components, provides a promising path to building computing systems that are robust to the unreliability of their constituent nanodevices. In this work, we highlight that this path can be illustrated by a computing system based on population coding with magnetic tunnel junctions that implement both neurons and synaptic weights. In particular, we show that equipping such a system with continuous learning enables it to recover from the loss of neurons and makes it possible to use unreliable synaptic weights (i.e. low energy barrier magnetic memories). There is a tradeoff between power consumption and precision because low energy barrier memories consume less energy than high barrier ones. For a given precision, there is an optimal number of neurons and an optimal energy barrier for the weights that leads to minimum power consumption.
1343	&#x00C5;-Indentation for non-destructive elastic moduli measurements of supported ultra-hard thin films and nanostructures	In this paper we report on the development of modulated nano-indentation (MoNI) to achieve sub-&#x00C5; resolution indentations while measuring applied loads and imaging materials with nanoscale resolution. MoNI was originally invented to measure the radial elasticity of multi-walled nanotubes, here we show how further progresses of MoNI allow for unprecedented high resolution indentation measurements to investigate non-destructively the elastic properties of supported two-dimensional (2D) materials and ultra-stiff ultra-thin films on substrates.
1344	Enhancement of Thermoelectric Figure of Merit by the Insertion of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes in &alpha;-MgAgSb	Hybrid materials provide an efficient alternative route on improving the thermoelectric performance comparing with doping elements. Especially, the insertion of carbon nanotubes plays an effective role on modulating the electrical transport properties and phonon scattering simultaneously. We firstly fabricated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) doped &alpha;-MgAgSb-based hybrid material and researched its thermoelectric properties in detail. The introduced MWCNTs enhanced carrier transport due to the metallic character of MWCNTs and increased phonon dispersion by the additional interfaces of insertions. The results showed that the electrical conductivity in &alpha;-MgAgSb/CNTs was remarkably enhanced especially at MgAg<sub>0.97</sub>Sb<sub>0.99</sub>/0.15 wt% CNTs boosting to 1.6 times than that of CNTs-free MgAg<sub>0.97</sub>Sb<sub>0.99</sub>. In addition, the thermal conductivity (&kappa;<sub>0.1</sub>) of MgAg<sub>0.97</sub>Sb<sub>0.99</sub>/0.1 wt% CNTs was reduced to 0.85 &kappa;<sub>0</sub>. As a result, the ZT value at room temperature was efficiently improved from 0.55 to 0.83, 1.5 times higher, and a high ZT value of 1.05 at 375 K was obtained. In addition, the dimensionless material factor B<sup>*</sup> increased from 0.98 to 1.49 at the doping level of 0.1 wt% CNTs at 300 K, which revealed that MWCNTs significantly enhanced thermoelectric performance of &alpha;-MgAgSb.
1345	<strong>Enhanced electrons extraction <strong>and superior performance of flexible perovskite solar cells using SnO<sub>2</sub>/graphene and Ag nanowires electrode</strong></strong>	The ultrafine silver (Ag) nanowires dispersed in a mixed solution of EMIMBF<sub>4 </sub>and water were spin-coated onto polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as perovskite solar cell (PVSC) flexible electrode. The graphene nanosheets (GNs) after weak oxidation were incorporated into SnO<sub>2 </sub>(SnO<sub>2</sub>/GNs) to enhance the electron mobility and flexibility of electron selective layer (ESL). The deposited C<sub>60</sub>-self-assembled monolayer(C<sub>60</sub>-SAM) between perovskite and ESL can impede carrier recombination. Herein, the improved surface photovoltage responses can be attributed to the synergistic effect of C<sub>60</sub>-SAM and SnO<sub>2</sub>/GNs ESL under zero and applied electric field. The best-performing PVSC has achieved a PCE of 13.36%, a V<sub>oc</sub> of 1.10 V, a J<sub>sc</sub> of 18.39 mA cm<sup>&minus;2</sup>, and a FF of 0.66 under a reverse voltage scan (the corresponding PCE of 12.81%, V<sub>oc</sub> of 1.10 V, J<sub>sc</sub> of 18.19 mA cm<sup>&minus;2</sup>, and FF of 0.64 under a forward scan), indicating the negligible hysteresis. The EMIMBF<sub>4 </sub>can improve the dispersivity and intrinsic contacts between Ag nanowires. The C<sub>60</sub>-SAM and SnO<sub>2</sub>/GNs can passivate surface traps in perovskite and enhance the charge dynamics. The PVSC in a low-temperature solution process is compatible with roll-to-roll manufacturing and the intrinsic charge dynamics was also explored.
1346	Magnetic edge states in bilayer zigzag graphene ribbon	The magnetic edge states in bilayer graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edges are studied by using an unrestricted self-consistent mean-field approach to a Hubbard model on the bilayer hexagonal lattice. Different from the single layer ribbon, three self-consistent solutions are found, corresponding to three different kinds of edge spin arrangements for AB-stacked bilayer zigzag ribbons. The edge state with the lowest energy is consistent with Lieb's theorem not only for the whole bilayer ribbon but also for each layer alone, where edge spins prefer ferromagnetic alignment within each layer while antiferromagnetic arrangement between the two layers.
1347	Topological charges of Skyrmions in Fe<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>0.5</sub>Si-Like Quasi-Two-Dimensional Ferromagnets	In a continuous system, magnetic skyrmions are characterized by an integer-valued topological index, often referred to as the topological charge. However, this topological concept is not applicable to the energetically stabilized magnetic structures of discrete lattices. In this work, we apply a quantized spin model to a Fe<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>0.5</sub>Si-Like quasi-two-dimensional ferromagnetic system with co-existing Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya and Heisenberg-exchange interactions. We find that, the helical texture is the spontaneous ground state; when a weak external magnetic field is applied normal to the magnetic layer, skyrmion lattice of hexagonal-closely-packed pattern is induced; our calculated periodic distances of the spin textures in weak external magnetic fields are consistent with the theoretical value; the topological charge of each skyrmion is a field-dependent non-integer value, showing strong effects of quantum physics unaccounted for by previous studies on continuous systems; each skymion is surrounded by four non-fully developed vortices, formed by the spins in the boundary area, which curl in the opposite direction; as the field is increased and temperature changes, the SkX pattern can be rotated, elongated and deformed; if the external field is continuously enhanced, a SkX plus bimeron phase appears, the spin texture evolves, and finally becomes ferromagnetic. Therefore, this quantum model, if scaled, is able to qualitatively reproduce the experimental results of SkX with long periodicity, and especially, it is expected to be more accurate than the classical ones when the skyrmion size is in the order of nanometer.
1348	<strong>Resonate and Fire Neuron with Fixed Magnetic Skyrmions</strong>	In the brain, the membrane potential of many neurons oscillates in a subthreshold damped fashion and fire when excited by an input frequency that nearly equals their eigen frequency. In this work, we investigate theoretically the artificial implementation of such &ldquo;resonate-and-fire&rdquo; neurons by utilizing the magnetization dynamics of a fixed magnetic skyrmion in the free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). To realize firing of this nanomagnetic implementation of an artificial neuron, we propose to employ voltage control of magnetic anisotropy or voltage generated strain as an input (spike or sinusoidal) signal, which modulates the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). This results in continual expansion and shrinking (i.e. breathing) of a skyrmion core that mimics the subthreshold oscillation. Any subsequent input pulse having an interval close to the breathing period or a sinusoidal input close to the eigen frequency drives the magnetization dynamics of the fixed skyrmion in a resonant manner. The time varying electrical resistance of the MTJ layer due to this resonant oscillation of the skyrmion core is used to drive a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) buffer circuit, which produces spike outputs. By rigorous micromagnetic simulation, we investigate the interspike timing dependence and response to different excitatory and inhibitory incoming input pulses. Finally, we show that such resonate and fire neurons have potential application in coupled nanomagnetic oscillator based associative memory arrays.
1349	The electronic structures and absorption spectra of Mn-doped GaAs nanowires in the magnetic field	The electronic structures and absorption spectra of Mn-doped GaAs nanowires in the magnetic field are calculated via eight-band k.p theory. During the calculation, the optical transitions satisfying the selection rule of nanowires at different wave vectors are considered. We find that (i) the shape of $\pi$ absorption spectra is substantially different from that of $\sigma$ absorption spectra whether the radius is 3 nm or 6 nm, and more strong peaks will appear in $\pi$ and $\sigma$ absorption spectra when the radius increases from 3 nm to 6 nm; (ii) the shape of $\pi$ absorption spectra is almost unchanged even if the magnetic field increases to 30 T, while it can be affected slightly by increasing the concentration of manganese ions; (iii) two $\sigma$ absorption spectra can be separated by the magnetic field, and the separation between $\sigma^+$ and $\sigma^-$ absorption spectra will increase as the increase of the magnetic field and the concentration of manganese ions; (iv) the intensities of the first strong peak in $\sigma^+$ absorption spectra will become larger than that of the first strong peak in $\sigma^-$ absorption spectra gradually as the increase of the magnetic field and the concentration of manganese ions.
1350	<strong>Flexible, transparent resistive switching device based on topological insulator Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>- organic composite</strong>	Two dimensional topological insulator (TIs) bismuth selenide (Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>) nanosheets embedded in Poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA) are employed for the first time for the resistive switching (RS) application. Hexagonal 2D Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3 </sub>nanosheets (NSs) are synthesized by a simple solvothermal method and combine with PMMA at different weight percentage of 2D Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>. Field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy along with other characterization such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)  &amp; Raman spectroscopy were performed for the characterization of Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3 </sub>@ PMMA hybrid system. Composite was deposited on transparent, flexible PET substrate to form Ag/Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>@PMMA/ITO memory cell. I-V characteristics of the device revealed stable and non-volatile memory effect. The device shows a significantly high resistance (R<sub>HRS</sub>/R<sub>LRS</sub>) ratio, more than 10<sup>3</sup>, high retention time (more than 9000 s) with high reproducibility over a large number of (10<sup>5</sup>) ac cycles. From the experimental data RS performances are explained by using a charge trapping&ndash;detrapping mechanism. Owing to the increasing interest in flexible electronics, bending tests have carried out at various bending diameters (10-30 mm) to show the mechanical robustness of the proposed device.
1351	<strong>A comparative study of polaronic transport in paramagnetic state of bulk and nanocrystalline La0.46Ca0.54MnO3 compound</strong>	In this present study, electronic transport and magneto-transport properties of bulk and nanocrystalline La0.46Ca0.54MnO3 compound is reported. The activation energies required for polaron transport in paramagnetic state for different average grain size particles were estimated from the resistivity as a function of temperature data in the absence of magnetic field. It is found that there is a strong dependency of the activation energy in paramagnetic state with the reduction of the grain sizes. Additionally, the correlation between the variation of activation energy and the crystallographic unit cell volume with the reduction of particle size is addressed.
1352	Multi-tip Scanning Tunneling Microscopy - Experimental Techniques and Data Analysis	In scanning tunneling microscopy, we witness in recent years a paradigm shift from "just imaging"sto detailed spectroscopic measurements at the nanoscale and multi-tip STM is a technique followingsthis trend. It is capable to perform nanoscale charge transport measurements like a "multimeter atsthe nanoscale". Distance-dependent four-point measurements, the acquisition of nanoscale potentialsmaps at current carrying nanostructures and surfaces, as well as the acquisition of I &#x2212; V curvessof nanoelectronic devices are examples of the capabilities of the multi-tip STM technique. In thissreview, we focus on two aspects: How to perform multi-tip STM measurements, and how to analyzesthe acquired data in order to gain insight into nanoscale charge transport processes for a varietysof samples. We further discuss specifics of the electronics for multi-tip STM, properties of tips forsmulti-tip STM, and present methods for a tip approach to nanostructures on insulating substrates.sWe introduce methods how to extract the conductivity/resistivity for mixed 2D/3D systems fromsfour-point measurements, and how to measure the conductivity of 2D sheets, and introduce scanningstunneling potentiometry (STP) measurements with a multi-tip setup. For the example of multitipsmeasurements at freestanding vapor liquid solid (VLS) grown nanowires, we discuss contactsresistances as well as the influence of the presence of the probing tips on the four point measurements.
1353	<strong>Understanding the influence of initial cluster size distribution on crystallization dynamics in phase-change materials</strong>	Phase-change materials are recognized as major technological contenders for the development of fast, low power and small non-volatile memories, and for realising the evolutionary paradigm of simultaneous data processing and storage for brain-like and neural computing.  The (re)crystallization process remains to be the limiting factor in deciding the operating speeds of phase-change devices.  It has been shown experimentally that pre-annealing amorphous phase-change materials leads to shorter crystallization times and therefore increased device switching speeds.  This has been attributed to the formation of nano-clusters embedded in the amorphous phase that reduce the incubation time for nucleation and leads to faster crystallization.  Recent work using enhanced transmission microscopy has confirmed the formation of nuclei that are few nanometres in size which enhance the crystallisation speed.  However, the correlation between the initial size distribution of nano-clusters on the crystallization dynamics is still uncertain, which is crucial for increasing the speed in phase-change memories and data processors.  This work aims to simulate the distribution of cluster sizes following pre-annealing and melt-quenching in as-deposited amorphous phase-change materials using the Master rate equation approach.  Moreover and to use this approach to systematically investigate the effects of theses simulated and theoretical Gaussian initial clusters densities in the sub-nanometre to few tens of nanometres range on the crystallization dynamics in phase-change material at different annealing rates.  This investigation revealed the enhancement of crystallization speeds with narrow initial distributions of small cluster sizes of few nanometres, for the same initial crystalline concentration, in agreement with enhanced microscopy observations.
1354	Nano-oscillator-based classification with a machine learning-compatible architecture	Pattern classification architectures leveraging the physics of coupled nano-oscillators have been demonstrated as promising alternative computing approaches, but lack effective learning algorithms. In this work, we propose a nano-oscillator based classification architecture where the natural frequencies of the oscillators are learned linear combinations of the inputs, and define an offline learning algorithm based on gradient back-propagation. Our results show significant classification improvements over a related approach with online learning. We also compare our architecture with a standard neural network on a simple machine learning case, which suggests that our approach is economical in terms of numbers of adjustable parameters. The introduced architecture is also compatible with existing nano-technologies: the architecture does not require changes in the coupling between nano-oscillators, and it is tolerant to oscillator phase noise.
1355	Spiking neuron circuits using superconducting quantum phase-slip junctions	Superconducting circuits that operate by propagation of small voltage or current pulses, corresponding to propagation of single flux or charge quantum, are naturally suited for implementing spiking neuron circuits. Quantum phase-slip junctions (QPSJs) are 1-D superconducting nanowires that have been identified as exact duals to Josephson junctions, based on charge-flux duality in Maxwell's equations. In this paper, a superconducting quantized-charge circuit element, formed using quantum phase-slip junctions, is investigated for use in high-speed, low-energy superconducting spiking neuron circuits. By means of a SPICE model developed for QPSJs, operation of this superconducting circuit to produce and transport quantized charge pulses, in the form of current pulses, is demonstrated. The resulting quantized-charge-based operation emulates spiking neuron circuits for brain-inspired neuromorphic applications. Additionally, to further demonstrate the operation of QPSJ-based neuron circuits, a QPSJ-based integrate and fire neuron circuit is introduced, along with simulation results using WRSPICE. Estimates for operating speed and power dissipation are provided and compared to Josephson junction and CMOS-based spiking neuron circuits.
1356	High-speed low-power neuromorphic systems based on magnetic Josephson junctions	Josephson junctions and single flux quantum (SFQ) circuits form a natural neuromorphic technology with SFQ pulses and superconducting transmission lines simulating action potentials and axons. Josephson junctions consist of superconducting electrodes with nanoscale barriers that modulate the coupling of the complex superconducting order parameter across the junction. When the order parameter undergoes a 2&pi; phase jump, the junction emits a voltage pulse with an integrated amplitude of a flux quantum &#x03D5;<sub>0</sub>=h/(2e<sup>2</sup> )=2.068x10<sup>-15</sup>Vs. The coupling across a junction can be controlled and modulated by incorporating nanoscale magnetic structure in the barrier. The magnetic state of embedded nanoclusters can be changed by applying small currents or field pulses, enabling both unsupervised and supervised learning. The advantage of this magnetic/superconducting technology is that it combines natural spiking behavior and plasticity in a single nanoscale device and is orders of magnitude faster and lower energy than other technologies. Maximum operating frequencies are above 100 GHz, while spiking and training energies are ~10<sup>-20</sup>J, 10<sup>-18</sup>J, respectively. This technology can operate close to the thermal limit, which at 4K, is considerably lower energy than in a human brain. The transition from deterministic to stochastic behavior can be studied with small temperature modifications. Here we present a tutorial on the spiking behavior of Josephson junctions, the use of nanoscale magnetic structure to modulate the coupling across the junction, the design and operation of magnetic Josephson junctions, device models and simulation of magnetic Josephson junction neuromorphic circuits, and potential neuromorphic architectures based on hybrid superconducting/ magnetic technology.
1357	Perspectives on Antibacterial Performance of Silver Nanoparticle-loaded Three-dimensional Polymeric Constructs	Silver nanoparticle (AgNP)-loaded polymeric constructs are widely investigated for potential applications as drug delivery systems, wound dressings, and anti-biofouling biomaterials.  Herein, we present several methods for fabricating such materials and evaluate their efficacy against Escherichia coli.  H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(v)</sub> plasma surface modification is employed to enhance material surface wettability (explored by water contact angle goniometry) and nanoparticle incorporation.  Compositional analyses reveal that incorporation of AgNPs on the surface and bulk of the materials strongly depends on the fabrication methodology.  More importantly, the nature of AgNP incorporation into the polymer has direct implications on the biocidal performance resulting from release of Ag+.  The mate-rials fabricated herein fell significantly short of healthcare standards with respect to antimicrobial behavior, and, in comparing our results to numerous literature studies.  Notably, we identified a glaring disparity in the way such results are often described.  Thus, this work also contains a critical evaluation of the literature, highlighting select poor-performing materials to demonstrate several shortcomings in the quantitative analysis and reporting of the antibacterial efficacy of AgNP-loaded materials.  Ultimately, we provide recommendations for best practices for better evaluation of these constructs towards improved antibacterial efficacy in medical settings.
1358	<strong>Micromagnetic simulation of spin torque ferromagnetic resonance in </strong><strong>nano-ring-shape confined magnetic tunnel junctions</strong>	Spin-torque excited ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) performed in nanoscale devices can be used to characterize material properties and optimize spintronic devices for application. In this paper, micromagnetic simulation is employed to study the FMR property in a nano-ring shaped magnetic tunnel junction. The simulation predictions are confirmed by experiments, revealing that two resonance states (mode-1 and mode-2) with different resonance frequency are excited by a microwave frequency current or magnetic field. The relative weak response signal of FMR at negative field can be attributed to the intrinsic asymmetric structure of MTJs, which leads to a bias-dependent asymmetric spin transfer torques. Besides, high-order harmonics with twice and three times of fundamental frequencies of the mode-1 and mode-2 are also observed.
1359	Nonlinear Plasmonics of Three-Dimensional Dirac Semimetals	The three-dimensional Dirac semimetal (3D DSM) is a new class of material with a slew of electronic and optical properties in common with graphene, while structurally having a bulk form like real metals. In particular, the Dirac bandstructure of 3D DSM conferred very high optical nonlinearities much like the case for graphene. Consequently, we found that 3D DSM has respectable nonlinear plasmonic performance in comparison with graphene, while retaining the structural benefits of bulk metals, having reduced passive plasmonic losses, and is much easier to handle in fabrication facilities. 3D DSM is expected to play a strong role in providing strong optical nonlinearities for all-optical switching, and at the same time offering a superior platform for nanophotonic device integration.
1360	Magnetic Domain Wall Neuron with Lateral Inhibition	<strong>The development of an efficient neuromorphic computing system requires the use of nanodevices that intrinsically emulate the biological behavior of neurons and synapses. While numerous artificial synapses have been shown to be analogous to biological synapses, the challenge of developing an artificial neuron is impeded by its more complex functionality. In particular, previous proposals for artificial neurons have required the use of external circuits to perform lateral inhibition, thereby decreasing the efficiency of the resulting neuromorphic computing system. This work therefore proposes a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron that intrinsically provides lateral inhibition, without requiring any additional circuitry. The proposed neuron is based on the previously proposed domain-wall magnetic tunnel junction devices, which have been proposed as artificial synapses and experimentally demonstrated for non-volatile logic. Single-neuron micromagnetic simulations are provided that demonstrate the ability of this neuron to implement the required leaking, integrating, and firing. These simulations are then extended to pairs of adjacent neurons to demonstrate, for the first time, lateral inhibition between neighboring artificial neurons. Finally, this intrinsic lateral inhibition is applied to a ten-neuron crossbar structure and trained to identify handwritten digits, and shown via direct large-scale micromagnetic simulation for 100 digits to correctly identify the proper signal for 94% of the digits.</strong>
1361	Tunable resistivity in ink-jet printed electrical structures on paper by plasma conversion of particle-free, stabilizer-free silver inks	Printable metal inks are typically composed of premade nanoparticles that require post-deposition thermal sintering to produce crystalline, electrically-conductive features.  In this paper, we show that particle-free Ag inks made from simple, water-soluble metal salts such as silver nitrate can be ink-jet printed and converted into electrical features with tunable resistivity at low temperature (&lt;100 oC) by exposure to a pure argon plasma.  X-ray diffraction confirms that the converted inks are crystalline and four-point probe electrical measurements show that the sheet resistances are a function of the pressure and power in the plasma.  From cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy analysis, we find that morphology of the converted silver layer becomes increasingly dense with increasing plasma treatment time, which explains the measured changes in sheet resistance, and that the thickness of the layer is ~1.5 &#x00B5;m, which yields a minimum resistivity of ~6&#x00D7;10-8 &#x03A9;-m, approximately 3.8X times higher than bulk resistivity of silver.  Interestingly, the resistivity can be varied over a span of 6 orders of magnitude which allows resistor-capacitor (RC) filter devices to be fabricated exhibiting varying cutoff frequencies from a single material and geometry.
1362	Development of a scanning probe microscopy integrated atomic layer deposition system for in-situ successive monitoring of thin films growth	A dual chamber system integrated with atomic layer deposition (ALD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) was developed for the successive monitoring of nanoparticles to thin films growth process. The samples were fabricated in the ALD chamber. A magnetic transmission rod enabled sample transferring between the ALD and the AFM test chambers without breaking the vacuum condition, avoiding possible surface morphology change when frequently varying the growth condition and oxidation when exposed to air. The sample transmission also avoids deposition and contamination on the AFM tip during the successive testing process. The sample stage has machined a group of accurate location pinholes, ensuring the 10 um2 measurement consistency. As a demonstration, platinum metallic thin films were fabricated with thickness control by varying ALD cycles. The surface morphology was monitored successively during the deposition. After high temperature treatment under vacuum condition and with controlled oxygen partial pressure, the aging and sintering phenomenon of particles has been observed in the AFM testing chamber. The integrated AFM/ALD instrument is potentially a powerful tool for thin film preparation and characterization system.
1363	2D re-programmable magnonic crystal with vertical control of the spin wave dynamics: Py film decorated with array of  elliptical nanodots	We investigate magnonic band structure in thin homogeneous Py film decorated with periodic array of elliptically shaped Py dots and separated by a Pt spacer. We demonstrated experimentally formation of the magnonic band structure for Damon-Eshbach wave propagating in Py film  with the band gap opened at the Brillouin zone border and band splitting at smaller wavenumbers, due to the Bragg resonance and interaction of propagating wave with a confined magnetization oscillations in nanodots, respectively. The shape anisotropy of the Py nanodots allows to control the spin wave dynamics through the switch between two states of the magnetization with respect to the underneath film magnetization. With numerical analysis we show that predominant role in formation of the magnonic band structure is played by a vertical dynamic coupling between propagating wave in the film and magnetization oscillations in the nanodots.
1364	<strong>Synthesis and intrinsic magnetism of bilayer graphene nanoribbons</strong>	Pristine bilayer graphene nanoribbons (BLGNRs) with the average width of ca. 9 nm were obtained by longitudinal unzipping the oxalic acid-intercalated double-walled carbon nanotubes followed by annealing at 900 <sup>o</sup>C. The magnetic properties of BLGNRs were investigated. The results reveal that BLGNRs show obvious antiferromagnetic behavior with the N&eacute;el temperature of ca. 66 K. It is proposed that (i) the spin-polarized edge states are the dominant magnetic source, and (ii) the antiferromagnetism is mainly caused by the interlayer couplings.
1365	<strong>Calculation of mass </strong><strong>attenuation coefficients, effective atomic numbers and electron densities for Iron, Cobalt, Copper and Zinc nano-Hydroxyapatite</strong>	Iron, cobalt, copper and zinc substituted hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (nFeHA, nCoHA, nCuHA and nZnHA) were obtained successfully by ultrasonically assisted wet chemical method. The values of X-ray attenuation coefficients of present samples were calculated experimentally using narrow transmission geometry. The specimens were absorbed with using 59.6 photons emitted from an <sup>241</sup>Am radioisotope source with 50 mCi activity. The attenuation coefficients of the samples were compared with each other, HA and real animal bone powder experimentally and XCOm predicted values. Electron densities and effective atomic numbers were derived from the mass attenuation coefficients. The obtained results may provide information on how much radiation the samples can absorb when they are exposed to X-rays at current energy.
1366	Single, double, and triple quantum dots in Ge/Si nanowires	We report highly tunable control of holes in Ge/Si core/shell nanowires. We demonstrate the<br />ability to create single quantum dots of various sizes, with low hole occupation numbers and clearly<br />observable excited states. For the smallest dot size we observe indications of single-hole occupation.<br />Moreover, we create double and triple tunnel-coupled quantum dot arrays. In the double quantum<br />dot conguration we observe Pauli spin blockade (PSB). These results open the way to perform hole<br />spin qubit experiments in these devices.
1367	<strong>NEURONAL CELLS CONFINEMENT BY MICROPATTERNED CLUSTER-ASSEMBLED DOTS WITH MECHANOTRANSDUCTIVE NANOTOPOGRAPHY </strong>	The <em>in vitro </em>fabrication of neural networks able to simulate brain circuits and to maintain their native connectivity is of strategic importance to gain a deep understanding of neural circuit physiology and brain natural computational algorithm(s). This would also enable a wide-range of applications including the development of efficient brain-on-chip devices or brain-computer interfaces. Chemical and mechanotransductive cues cooperate to promote proper development and functioning of neural networks. Since the 80&rsquo;s, controlled growth of mammalian neuronal cells on micrometric patterned chemical cues with the development of synaptic connections and electrical activity has been reported, however the role of mechanotransductive signaling on the growth/organization of neural networks has not been investigated so far. Here we report the fabrication and characterization of patterned substrates for neuronal culture with a controlled structure both at the nano- and microscale suitable for the selective adhesion of neuronal cells. Nanostructured micrometric dots were patterned on passivated cell-repellent glass substrates by supersonic cluster beam deposition of zirconia nanoparticles through stencil masks. Cluster-assembled nanostructured zirconia surfaces are characterized by nanotopographical features that can direct the maturation of neural networks by mechanotransductive signaling. Our approach produces a controlled microscale pattern of adhesive areas with predetermined nanoscale morphology. We have validated these micropatterned substrates using a neuronal cell line (PC12 cells) and cultured hippocampal neurons. While cells have been uniformly plated on the substrates, they adhered only on the nanostructured zirconia regions, remaining effectively confined inside the nanostructured dots on which they were found to grow, move and differentiate.
1368	Thermo-Magneto Effects on Cu- Engine-Oil/Water-Nanofluids in a Porous Annulus Medium	In this attempt, we examined the thermo-magneto influences on nanofluid in a porous circular annulus region, bounded by the rotating cylinders, in the presence of the constant radial magnetic field but variable thermal conductivity. The nanofluid consists of a sample liquid (water/ engine oil) along with suspended copper-nanoparticles. We formulated this physical problem and developed the analytical solutions, by using the homotopy analysis method, in the form of the physical variables such as; the pressure, the fluid speed, the temperature, shear stress, the thermal heat transfer and the concentration of nanoparticles. Then we studied the effects of the field parameters on these physical variables. We found that the fluid-speed (pressure) increases (decreases) with the Forchheirmer coefficient, the porosity, the applied magnetic field intensity and the angular speed of an outer cylinder but it decreases with angular speed of the inner cylinder, for both the liquids. The reverse flow exists if the inner and outer cylinders are rotating in the opposite directions for both the liquids. Furthermore the thermal transfer rate in engine oil is lower than that in water. If the annulus region is squeezed then the fluid-speed decays while the pressure rises. The temperature and the thermal transfer rate decay if we march from inner cylinder to outer one. The porosity and the angular speed of the outer cylinder enhance the viscous dissipation and shear stress. The concentration is proportional to the temperature. The results are also compared with the existing literature for the clear fluid. The comparison is well.
1369	<strong>Structural phase transition, grain growth and optical properties of uncompensated Ga-V co-doped TiO<sub>2</sub></strong>	Effect of uncompensated Ga-V co-doping (0&le;<em>x</em>&le;0.046) on structural phase transition, grain growth process and optical properties of TiO<sub>2</sub> is reported here. Inhibition of phase transition due to co-doping is confirmed by X-ray diffraction measurement. Activation energy of phase transition increases from 120KJ/mol (<em>x</em>=0) to 240 KJ/mol (<em>x</em>=0.046) due to Ga-V co-doping.  In anatase phase, lattice constants increase by the effect of Ga<sup>3+</sup> interstitials.  This results in inhibition of phase transition.  Anatase phase becomes stable up to ~650 &deg;C in co-doped sample whereas for pure TiO<sub>2</sub> phase transition starts in between 450-500 &#x2070;C. In anatase phase, strain increases due to co-doping which reduces crystallite size. In rutile phase, grain growth process is enhanced due to co-doping and particles show a rod-like structure with majority {110} facets. Bandgap decreases in both phases and reduced to the visible light region. BET analysis shows that surface area increases from 4.55 m<sup>2</sup>/g (<em>x</em>=0) to 96.53 m<sup>2</sup>/g (<em>x</em>=0.046) by Ga-V incorporation which provide a large number of active site for photocatalytic activity. Hence, co-doped anatase nanoparticle can be used as a promising candidate for photocatalytic applications using visible light up to a higher temperature ~650 &deg;C.
1370	<strong>Pulsed Laser Transfer of Micro-droplets through </strong><strong>Patterned Apertures in Thin Copper Films</strong>	This paper explores a mask-based approach to control the transfer of molten droplets from a donor film to a target substrate by locally heating copper films with a nanosecond pulsed laser. The presence of apertures in the donor film facilitate the generation of micro-bumps with small protrusions that extend into micro-jets with diameters of between 1-2 mm and a height of up 5 mm above the donor film surface. The micro-jets break-up into single or multiple droplets that are deposited on the target substrate. The number of transferred droplets for a single laser shot depends on the film thickness and the laser fluence. The smallest diameter of a single droplet observed on the target substrate is below 3 mm, obtained from an 800 nm thick donor film. We explore a 2D axisymmetric heat conduction numerical model to investigate the temperature distribution in the donor film and the corresponding material phases expected for different laser fluence and film thicknesses. Furthermore, we use the results from the model to provide a qualitative explanation for the micro-bumps and micro-jets observed in the experiment, and to identify the regime where controlled melting of the donor film and transfer of molten droplets to the target substrate can be facilitated. Our results suggest that the aperture-based approach has the potential to control the minimum size of droplets transferred to the target substrate, thus allowing for controlled synthesis of micro- and nanosized metal particles, which have significant interests in sensing and catalysis applications, and microscale ballistic experiments.
1371	Designing CdS/Se heterojunction as high-performance self-powered UV-visible broadband photodetector	Se nanorod film is successfully synthesized on hydrothermally-grown CdS layer through a facile vapor phase deposition process, forming a n-CdS/p-Se heterojunction. By virtue of the narrow direct bandgap and large absorption coefficient in UV-visible range of CdS and Se, the integrated CdS/Se photodetector exhibits excellent self-powered behavior in wide spectral range. In particular, the heterojunction device shows a high photoresponse under weak light irradiation (500 nm, 1.08 &#x00B5;W/cm2) with large on-off ratio (9&#x00D7;103), high responsivity (40 mA/W) and detectivity (1.3&#x00D7;1013 Jones), as well as fast response speed (rise time 2 &#x03BC;s and decay time 22 ms).
1372	Novel optical property of PbS/ZnS nanocrystals	PbS quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized via colloidal route, and then PbS/ZnS nanocrystals (NCs) were prepared for the first time by two different routes: the epitaxial growth and cation substitution method. The structure and optical property of these NCs were characterized by XRD, EDX and vis-NIR absorption. For two kinds of PbS/ZnS NCs, the ground state exciton binding energy becomes stronger due to introducing of Zn, and there is the same blue shift of optical band gap despite their different sizes, which isn&rsquo;t in accordance with the classic <em>E<sub>g</sub></em>-R relation of nanoparticles. Two new exciton peaks appear in PbS/ZnS NCs.
1373	<strong>Study on Electrical Behavior of Copper </strong><strong>and its Alloys</strong><strong> Containing Dispersed Nanoparticles</strong>	Nanoparticles can be added to metals to tune their properties for widespread applications. Significant research has been recently conducted to understand the functional properties of the nanoparticle reinforced metals. However, few theories exist to understand how nanoparticles interact with metals to affect their electrical performance, partly due to the difficulty in producing bulk metal samples containing dispersed nanoparticles. In this work, bulk copper and copper alloy samples (Cu, Cu-40Zn, and Cu-60Ag) containing dispersed tungsten carbide (WC) nanoparticles (~100-200 nm) of more than 20 vol.% were successfully fabricated via solidification processing. The experimental results show that copper and its alloys with an increasing volume fraction of nanoparticles offer an exponentially decaying electrical conductivity. A new theoretical model compatible with the Nordheim&rsquo;s rule was established to predict the electrical behavior of metals containing dispersed nanoparticles.. The new model on the electrical behavior of the copper nanocomposite samples is experimentally validated by the low-temperature resistivity and electronic heat capacity above Debye temperature.
1374	<strong>Preparation of MoS<sub>2</sub> Quantum Dots Based on Optimized Liquid Phase Exfoliation and Its Optical Properties</strong>	MoS<sub>2</sub> quantum dots prepared by the optimized liquid phase exfoliation technique are investigated in this study. Thorough grinding of the bulk material followed by an ultrasonic reaction may facilitate the formation of quantum dots with narrow size distribution. The morphology, crystal structures and chemical properties of the quantum dots are studied using TEM, AFM, XRD, FTIR, Raman and XPS respectively. The optical properties of the nanomaterial are characterized by UV-Vis and fluorescence spectrophotometers. The results showed that the MoS<sub>2</sub> quantum dots fluoresce under 365 nm excitation and they exhibited graphene-like properties. Such characteristics of MoS<sub>2</sub> quantum dots would have great potential in optoelectronic applications.
1375	<strong>Inhibition of spontaneous emission in a leaky mode wedge nanocavity<sup></sup></strong>	In this paper, we experimentally investigate the effective role of a wedge-type leaky-mode nanocavity on the inhibition dynamics of the spontaneous emission rate of core-shell CdTe/CdS quantum dots. Three dimensional wedge cavities are fabricated inside a fused silica micro-rod by a conventional fiber-drawing technique, which allow confinement of the quantum dots by the capillary effect. It is demonstrated that both optical and geometrical design of the photonic cavity enforce the generation of leaky modes that cause an inhibition in the spontaneous emission rate monotonically, by about 50%, due to coupling of the emitted photons into continuum modes. Time-resolved experiments confirm that the spontaneous emission rate decreases as the cavity wedge angle increases from 43 to 88 degrees. The physics behind the transduction mechanism of this phenomenon is explained by the weak-coupling regime.
1376	Rheological (extensional, shear) and morphological properties of linear low density polyethylene nanocomposites in the presence of modified and unmodified silica	The objectives of this study are to investigate the effect of modification of silica nanoparticles on the rheological behavior of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) in both shear and extensional flow. The silica nanoparticles surface was modified by silanization reaction and with hexadecyltrimethoxysilane as silane agent. Melt blending method was performed to prepare the nanocomposites samples. Characterization methods included Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and rheometric measurements under shear and uniaxial extensional flows. Sentmanat Extension Rheometer (SER) and parallel plate rheometer were used to investigate rheological behavior of the nanocomposites in extensional and shear flow, respectively. The shear data illustrated that for all samples, storage modulus and complex viscosity of LLDPE with the modified silica nanoparticles were higher than the samples containing unmodified silica. The extensional rheology results showed that regardless of the type of silica, the elongational viscosity becomes larger by the incorporation of silica nanoparticles. LLDPE containing 2 wt.% of the unmodified silica nanoparticles demonstrated strain hardening behavior that was disappeared by increasing loading of the unmodified silica from 2 to 8 wt.%. Another interesting result was obtained for the LLDPE nanocomposite samples containing the modified silica particles. By loading of the modified silica nanoparticles in LLDPE nanocomposite samples, a fracture took place due to gel structure formation in these samples. Finally, Kaye-Bernstein-Kearsley-Zapas (K-BKZ) model was used to correlate the extensional rheological property of the present LLDPE/ SiO2 nanocomposites.
1377	The same optical property of PbS/ZnS nanocrystals with different sizes	PbS quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized via colloidal route, and then PbS/ZnS nanocrystals (NCs) were prepared for the first time by two different routes:  the epitaxial growth and cation substitution method. The structure and optical property of these NCs were characterized by XRD, EDX and vis-NIR absorption. For two kinds of PbS/ZnS NCs, the ground state exciton binding energy becomes stronger due to introducing of Zn, and there is the same blue shift of optical band gap despite their different sizes, which isn't in accordance with the classic Eg-R relation of nanoparticles. Two new exciton peaks appear in PbS/ZnS NCs.
1378	<strong>Mixed convection characteristics in a U-shaped lid-driven cavity with a baffle in the presence of magnetic field</strong>	In the present study, mixed convection of CuO/water nanofluid in a lid-driven U-shaped enclosure filled with a baffle is studied using lattice Boltzmann method. The bottom wall is fixed at a uniform temperature and the effect of magnetic field is investigated. KKL (Koo-Kleinstreuer-Li) model is used to get the effective thermal conductivity and viscosity of nanofluid. In this model, Brownian motion of nanoparticle is considered. Effect of Hartmann number, Richardson number, Reynolds number and nanoparticle volume fraction on the fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics have been examined. The results revealed that the addition of nanoparticles has a significant positive effect on the heat transfer. However, at <em>Re</em> = 100, the nanofluid strategy has a detrimental effect on the Nusselt number when the Richardson number is high. As Reynolds number increases, the average Nusselt number increases but adverse trends can be observed when the Hartmann numbers increases. The effect of increasing Reynolds number on the heat transfer is more pronounced at higher Richardson numbers.
1379	Integrating Plasmonic Nanostructures with Natural Photonic Architectures in Pd-Modified <em>Morpho</em> Butterfly Wings for Sensitive Hydrogen Gas Sensing	This work reports a bioinspired three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous structure for optical hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) sensing. The structure was fabricated by selective modification of the photonic architectures of <em>Morpho</em> butterfly scales with Pd nanostrips. The coupling of the plasmonic mode of the Pd nanostrips with the optical resonant mode of the <em>Morpho</em> biophotonic architectures generated a sharp reflectance peak in the spectra of Pd-modified butterfly wing, as well as enhancement of light-matter interaction in Pd nanostrips. Exposure to H<sub>2</sub> resulted in a rapid reversible increase in the reflectance of the Pd-modified butterfly wing, and the pronounced response of the reflectance was at the wavelength where the plasmonic mode strongly interplayed with the optical resonant mode. Owing to the synergetic effect of Pd nanostrips and biophotonic structures, the bioinspired sensor achieved an H<sub>2</sub> detection limit of less than 10 ppm. Besides, the Pd-modified butterfly wing also exhibited good sensing repeatability. The results suggest that this approach provides a promising optical H<sub>2</sub> sensing scheme, which may also offer the potential design of new nanoengineered structures for diverse sensing applications.
1380	Aluminum Nitride (AlN) Single Nanowire UV Photodetector	High UV light sensitivity, small size, very short response time, low power consumption, and high efficiency are the most important features of nanowire based devices for new and superior applications in photodetectors, photovoltaics, optical switches, and image sensors. Single AlN nanowire UV photodetector has been fabricated from the catalyst-free grown high quality AlN nanowires through a very practical scheme. The UV photodetector, which can operate at low voltages ({less than or equal to} 3 V), has shown a significant photocurrent response to the 254 nm UV light exposure. Moreover, the photocurrent has decayed to the dark current value rapidly, after the exposure ended suggesting the absence of defect-related traps. Furthermore, the photocurrent rise (&#x03C4;r) and decay time constants (&#x03C4;d) have been determined through modelling from the time-dependent current response curves of the photodetector. The &#x03C4;r  and &#x03C4;d were determined to be 7.7 s and 11.5 s, respectively.
1381	<strong>Exchange-interaction by the induced growth of the soft phase on the extreme hard phase </strong>	The significant change is reported in interparticle interaction for nanocomposites of &epsilon;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and FeCo with the morphological change of the soft phase (FeCo) from amorphous to crystalline state upon annealing. It undergoes a transition from the dipolar interaction dominant regime into the exchange-interaction dominant regime, starting from the crystalline soft phase size of 9.6 nm, which is coincident with the theoretical critical dimension. The effective anisotropy increases exponentially as the ordering dimension of the soft phase increases with the ratio between hard and soft phases stays constant, causing a delay in the demagnetization process. The emerged exchange-interaction is understood by the induced growth of the soft phase on the extreme hard phase.
1382	Facile Synthesis of Ultra-Small Polydopamine-PEG Nanoparticles for Cellular Delivery	Very small polydopamine (PDA) poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) crosslinked copolymer (PDA-PEG) nanoparticles have been prepared following a convenient one-step procedure in aqueous solution. Particle sizes and colloidal stabilities have been optimized by varying PEG in view of chain length and end group functionalities. In particular, amine-terminated PEG3000 (PEG3000(NH2)2) reacted with polydopamine intermediates so that very small, crosslinked PDA-PEG nanoparticles with sizes of less than 50 nm were formed. These nanoparticles remained stable in buffer solution and no sedimentation occurred. Chemical functionalization was straight-forward as demonstrated by the attachment of fluorescent dyes. The PDA-PEG nanoparticles revealed efficient cellular uptake and high cytocompatibility thus rendering them attractive candidates for cell imaging or for drug delivery applications.
1383	Streamer corona, single filament, transient glow, dc glow, spark and their transitions in atmospheric air	By using a ballast resistor having resistance of 10 M&#x03A9;, varying the gap distance from 23 mm to 0 mm and using a fixed dc voltage at 14 kV, the streamer corona, single filament, transient glow, dc glow and spark modes and their transitions are demonstrated in positive needle-to-plate air discharge at atmospheric pressure. The electrical characteristics, the rotational temperature and vibrational temperature of N2, as well as the temporal behavior of streamer propagation in these discharge modes are investigated. First, to the best of our knowledge, the transient glow mode between the single filament mode and the dc glow mode, operated in a stable repetitive fashion, is reported for the first time in positive dc air discharges. The pulse repetition frequency ranges from 7.5 to 15 kHz. The current density and the rotational temperature are in the range of 27-105 A/mm2 and 600-850 K, respectively. Its temporal behavior reveals that, after the primary streamer arrives at the cathode, the secondary streamer initiates within several nanoseconds near the anode and then propagates at high speed of 105-106 m/s. There is no transition to spark even after the secondary streamer arrives at the cathode. Second, the transition from single filament to transient glow is characterized by the sudden decrease of the pulse repetition frequency and the abrupt increase of the current amplitude, the pulse width and the gas temperature. Third, the transition from transient glow to dc glow is identified visibly by the formation of typical glow structure (positive column, Faraday dark space and negative glow), which is accompanied by the transition of the discharge current from nanosecond pulse to dc. In addition, both the ballast resistor and the stray capacitor exert significant influence on the transition of discharge modes.
1384	<strong>Multiband Light Emission and Nanoscale Chemical Analyses of Carbonized Fumed Silica</strong>	Fumed silica with specific area of 295 m<sup>2</sup>/g were carbonized by successive phenyltrimethoxysilane treatments followed by annealing in inert atmosphere up to 650 <sup>o</sup>C. Emission, excitation, kinetics and photo-induced bleaching effects were investigated by steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopies. The local chemistry was also studied by infrared transmission spectroscopy. Strong ultraviolet and visible photoluminescence was observed in the samples after the chemical treatments/modifications and thermal annealing. It has been shown that ultraviolet photoluminescence in chemically modified fumed silica is associated with phenyl groups, while near ultraviolet and visible emission in annealed samples are originated from inorganic pyrolytic carbon precipitates dispersed in the silica host matrix. Two types of emission bands were identified as a function of the annealing temperature: one is in the near UV and the other is in the visible range. Based on the emission/excitation analysis of these two bands, as well as on correlations with the synthesis conditions, a structural-energy concept of light-emitting centers has been proposed. According to this model, the light-emitting centers are associated with sub-nanometer carbon clusters that can be bonded or adsorbed on the silica surface.  This has been validated by a detailed (S)TEM-EELS study, confirming the presence of 2-6 nm carbon nanoclusters, inhomogeneously distributed at the surface of the silica nanoparticles. These carbon nanoclusters are mostly amorphous although they possess some degree of graphitization and local order. Finally, the fraction of sp<sup>2</sup> carbon in these nanoclusters has been estimated to be close to 80 %.
1385	Electrostatic transport modulation in single crystal VO<sub>2</sub> nanowire channels and their width dependence using planar-type side gating	Investigations of electric field-induced resistance modulation in correlated electron oxides with a metal-insulator transition play a significant role in understanding the behavior of nano-domains <em>via</em> electric perturbation and in paving the way for steep slope switching applications. Here we report the dependence of the resistance switching effect on both the width of oxide nanowires and their crystallinity in VO<sub>2</sub>-based planar-type field effect transistors. A positive electric field yielded an expansion of the metallic nano-domains, while a negative one caused a depletion layer to form. Moreover, narrower VO<sub>2</sub> nanowires and single crystal VO<sub>2</sub> nanowires showed effective resistance modulation when the gate bias was varied. Our results provide an understanding of the electronic characteristics in metal-insulator nano-domains through carrier modulation and further the development of devices employing metal&ndash;insulator nano-domains.
1386	<strong>Thermal property engineering of InSe layer by a thin </strong><strong>Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> stress liner</strong>	We investigate the thermal properties of thin InSe layers with high-&kappa; oxide Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> stress liners. The temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> passivation layer significantly improved the thermal stability of the InSe layer by reducing the thermal coefficients of in-plane E<sub>2g</sub><sup>1</sup> phonon mode from -0.03284 cm<sup>-1</sup>/K to -0.0212 cm<sup>-1</sup>/K in comparison with the InSe sample without Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> capping layer. Combined with the power-dependent Raman spectroscopy, the in-plane thermal conductivity of InSe reaches to about 53.1W/mK, greatly larger than that without Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> capping layer 38.2 W/mK, which is owing to the large thermal conductivity of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and the electron-phonon interactions at the interface. Generally, this work will contribute to improve the performances of the InSe-based nano-devices and extend its applications profoundly.
1387	Electrical Tunable Localized States in Sub-band of Bilayer Graphene Nanoribbon	Multiple sub-bands transport in bilayer graphene nanoribbon (GNR) with localized charge states has not been experimentally investigated, owing to the difficulty of accessing into the upper sub-band. In this letter, we utilize current annealing to heavily p-dope graphene from a capping hydrogen-silsesquioxane layer. As a result, Fermi energy can be tuned into the upper sub-valence band with reasonably small gate voltage. Owing to the localized charge states, quantum dots-like characteristics is measured in bilayer GNR, as a result of the tunnelling transport of holes in the upper sub-band through these charge puddles. In contrast to monolayer GNRs, this phenomenon appears in a considerable conductive regime, since the carrier transport in the lower sub-band is still diffusive. Moreover, by electrically tuning the Fermi energy, the localized charge puddles in upper sub-band can be resized and isolated from each other, finally leading to the single &ldquo;quantum-dot&rdquo; dominated transport.
1388	Wafer-scale fabrication of amorphous silicon nanospheres in array on 6H-SiC (0001) towards a black body wave-absorber	Amorphous silicon (a-Si) nanospheres are grown on substrate of 6H-SiC (0001) by deposition of silicon on a wafer scale. The spheres in array are uniformly dispersed, and size-controllable. The a-Si spheres on substrate have a significant absorption within the range of ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) light, resulting removal of the a-Si spheres can boost the reflectance by substrate around 15%. The special structure of silicon particles on SiC might have potential applications towards the field of optoelectronic devices.
1389	Can an Element Form a Two-Dimensional Nanosheet of Type 15 Pentagons?	Type 15 pentagon was recently discovered three decades since the 14th type of pentagon was re-ported in 1985. In contrast to such a long time span, the list of two-dimensional (2D) materials keeps growing longer on a monthly (if not daily) basis according to emerging experimental and theoretical reports. Combining these two seemingly irrelevant topics, we apply density functional theory (DFT) calculations to examine the possibility of forming a 2D nanosheet with the vertices of type 15 pentagons occupied by boron, carbon, silicon, phosphorous, sulfur, gallium, germanium, or tin atoms. We find that none of the optimized eight nanosheets remain the same initial structure filled with type 15 pentagons after the geometry optimizations by a DFT calculator. Instead, we obtain different rearranged structures for each nanosheet, most of which have not yet been reported before. For example, gallium atoms form a 2D nanosheet structure with a triangular pattern that is similar to single-layer boron sheet called borophene. These new 2D materials exhibit formation energies that are comparable to that of single-layer silicene, implying the feasibility of being grown on a substrate. The electronic structure shows that all the eight nanosheets are metallic (or semi-metallic for the carbon nanosheet), compensating for the dearth of metallic systems in existing 2D materials that are mostly semiconducting. Our work shows that linking the geometry of pentagonal tiling with DFT calculations yields both educational and scientific merits.
1390	<strong>Manufacture and analysis of nanostructured monolayer porous silicon (Psi) for silicon solar cell applications</strong>	Manufacture of PSi is produced successfully depending upon photo-electrochemical etching method. Aim of this paper is to differentiate the characterization of the PSi monolayer compared to the bulk silicon. The surface of the ordinary p-n solar cell has been refabricated on the n-type region of (100) orientation in order to get better of the conversion efficiency. The procedure relied on the variable the etching time with fixed current density and vice versa. The other procedure conditions were saved constant, the HF concentration and temperature. The role of different laser kinds and powers irradiated the n-region has been understood. In especially, the blue laser (473 nm of two powers 50 and 100 mW) appears to be the most effective wavelength to achieve the optimum efficiency and pore sizes as well as the etching rate. The samples were tested and categorized by the (I-V) Measurement and investigated by SEM, PL and AFM tests. Finally, we got solar cell efficiency was in the range of (11%) compared to the ordinary solar cell efficiency which was (3.34%).
1391	Tuning the structural and magnetic properties of MnZn nano-ferrites synthesized under a high magnetic field	An approach to improve the saturation magnetization and lower magnetic loss of nanocrystalline MnZn ferrites is given. Mn0.6Zn0.4Fe2O4 nano-particles are synthesized by a phase transformation method under dc magnetic field of 0, 2, 4, and 6 T, respectively, and their structural and magnetic properties are investigated. The saturation magnetization of the 6 T sample is ~18 % and ~16 % higher than that of the 0 T sample at 120 K and 300 K, respectively. The saturation magnetization at 120 K increases with the fabrication field up to 6 T. The lattice strain also increases with the fabrication field.
1392	A Fast Turn-on, High Intensity Plasma-induced Electron Emission Cathode Based on TiN-nanorod@carbon fiber Composite Structure	The remaining challenges confronting high-current pulsed beam sources stimulate the development of robust cold cathodes. A TiN nanorod@carbon fiber cathode was prepared by hydrothermal method and nitriding. The light emission and plasma formation on the cathode surface were compared between carbon fiber cathode and TiN nanorod@cabon fiber cathode. The uniform and large-area plasma was generated on TiN nanorod@cabon fiber cathode, owing to a higher electric field enhancement factor. Further, TiN nanorod@cabon fiber cathode turned on faster, which is inferred by theoretical derivation and evolution of beam currents. TiN nanorod@cabon fiber cathode represents a promising cold cathode with superior performance.
1393	Influence of multi-scale and curved structures on the migration of stem cells	Understanding how topographical cues can control cell behavior is a major fundamental question which is of particular interest for tissue engineering. Recent findings show that cell-scale curvature, as well as nanoscale topography can affect different aspects of cell migration. However, the correlation between specific curvature radii and cell behavior, as well as the combinatorial effect of nanoscale topography and cell-scale curvature has not yet been investigated. Herein, we employ a new femtosecond laser ablation method to generate multiscale topographical patterns directly on titanium surfaces. The process allows us to produce microgrooves of specific curvature imprinted with oriented nano-topographical features called Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS). We show that curved grooves stimulate stem cell migration speed in comparison to flat or linear grooves. The fastest velocities are observed on 75&#x00B5;m curvature radius, whereas cells migrating on 125&#x00B5;m curvatures exhibit similar speeds to the ones migrating on straight lines. Double replicas of these grooves allow us to mask the LIPSS while keeping identical the cell-scale pattern, therefore permitting to uncouple the effect of nano- and microscale topographies. We found that the presence of nanoscale topographies improves the reading of microgrooves curvature by cells. Altogether, this work shows that the combination of specific curvatures together with nano-patterning can control the velocity of migrating stem cells and promote the use of femtosecond laser ablation in the context of surface implant design.
1394	Determination of the thermal diffusivity of plasmonic nanofluids based on PVP-coated Ag nanoparticles by means of the mode-mismatched dual-beam thermal lens technique	Plasmonic nanofluids have found applications in many fields, such as for example, coolants, solar<br />collectors, and theranostics agents. For such applications, an important parameter is the thermal<br />diffusivity. In this communication, we present an experimental study concerning the dependence on<br />the concentration of the thermal diffusivity of highly diluted aqueous plasmonic nanofluids made of<br />PVP-coated silver nanoparticles. Measurements were made by employing the time resolved mode-<br />mismatched thermal lens technique and the results show an enhancement of the thermal diffusivity,<br />when compared to that of the carrier fluid, on increasing the number density of the nanoparticles,<br />and being rather constant as a function of the power of the pump beam.
1395	Artificial Kerr effect on the self-focusing of laser in a dissipative suspension of metallic nanoparticles	Self-focusing of laser beam propagating through a dissipative suspension of metallic nanoparticles is studied. Impact of imaginary part of nanoparticle polarizability on the optical force and consequently on the particles rearrangement in the presence of laser fields with an initial Gaussian profile is considered. It is shown that the absorption of laser leads to the creation of optical force along the wave propagation direction which can cause longitudinal distribution of nanoparticles. Considering fifth order nonlinearity of wave amplitude that comes from the simultaneous considering of normal Kerr effect produced by the inhomogeneity of refractive index resulted from the ponderomotive force acting on conducting electrons and artificial Kerr nonlinearity caused by the polarization optical force acting on electrically polarized particles, set of differential equations describing nonlinear steady-state evolution of laser beam is derived by using a non-paraxial method. Dynamics of laser for different frequencies is investigated and optimum frequency range for improving focusing property is determined. It is shown that the artificial Kerr effect causes localization of particles near the propagation axis that can substantially reduce the threshold power for occurring self-focusing in comparison with plasma and other rigid plasmonic systems.
1396	Characterization of dynamics and mechanism in the self-assembly of AOT reverse micelles	Reverse micelles (RMs) are recognized as a paradigm of molecular self-assembly and used in a variety of applications, such as chemical synthesis and molecular structure refinement. Nevertheless many fundamental properties including  their equilibrium size distribution, internal structure, and mechanism of self-assembly remain poorly understood. To provide an enhanced, microscopic understanding of the assembly process and resulting structural distribution, we perform multiple nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of  AOT RM assembly, quantifying RM size, water core structure, and dynamics. Rapid assembly of smaller RM from a random mixture is observed to establish a constant AOT water loading within a nanosecond consistent with a diffusion-adsorption mechanism validated through Monte-Carlo simulation of a model system. The structure of RM water cores and RM molecular volume of during RM assembly is characterized during the AOT assembly process. A moment-closure equation is developed from a novel master equation model to elucidate the elementary events underlying the AOT self-assembly process. The resulting kinetic model is used to explore the role of monomer addition and dissociation, RM association and dissociation, and RM collision-induced exchange, all dependent on average RM size, which provides fundamental insight regarding the mechanisms and timescales for AOT RM self-assembly. The nascent dynamics that rapidly establish water loading, intermediate time scales of RM fusion, and longer timescale dynamics of inter-RM exchange essential in establishing equilibrium condition are quantified through these kinetic models. Overall, this work provides insight into AOT RM self-assembly and provides a general theoretical framework for the analysis of molecular self assembly dynamics and mechanism.
1397	<strong>Infrared tubular microcavity based on rolled-up GeSn/Ge nanomembranes<sup></sup></strong>	Germanium-Tin (GeSn) alloys have attracted great amount of attentions as these group IV semiconductors present direct band-gap behavior with high Sn content and are compatible with current complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology. In this work, three dimensional tubular GeSn/Ge micro-resonators with diameter of around 7.3 &mu;m were demonstrated by rolling up GeSn nanomembranes grown on Ge-on-insulator wafer via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The microstructural properties of the resonators were carefully investigated and the strain distributions of the rolled-up GeSn/Ge microcavities along the radial direction is studied by utilizing micro-Raman spectroscopy with different excitation laser wavelengths. The values of the strains calculated from Raman shifts agree well with the theoretical prediction. Coupled with fiber tapers, as-fabricated devices present high quality factor up to 800 in the transmission spectral measurements. The micro-resonators fabricated via rolled-up nanotechnology and GeSn/Ge nanomembranes in this work may have great potential in photonic micro- and nano-devices.
1398	Comprehensive numerical modeling of filamentary RRAM devices including voltage ramp-rate and cycle-to-cycle variations	The equilibrium ON and OFF states of resistive random access memory (RRAM) are due to formation and destruction of a conducting filament. The laws of thermodynamics dictate that these states correspond to the minimum of free energy. Here, we develop a numerical model that, through the minimization of free energy at a given voltage, determines the filament parameters and thus the electric current. Overall, it simulates the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of RRAM. The model describes mutual transformations of RRAM states through SET (ON&rarr;OFF) and RESET (OFF&rarr;ON) processes. From the modeling perspectives, these states and processes constitute four programming modules constructed here in COMSOL multiphysics software tackling the electrodynamic and heat transfer equations and yielding RRAM energy and I-V. Our modeling uniquely reproduces the observed I-V varying with voltage ramp-rates. That is achieved by accounting for the ramp-rate dependent activation energy of conduction. The underlying mechanism is due to the deformation interaction caused by the double well atomic potentials universally present in amorphous materials and having exponentially broad distribution of relaxation times. As another unique feature, our modeling reproduces the observed cycle-to-cycle variations of RRAM parameters attributed to the lack of self-averaging in small ensembles of double well potentials and electronic states in geometrically small (nano-size) RRAM structures.
1399	Enhanced Raman scattering of graphene using double resonance in silicon photonic crystal nanocavities	We demonstrate enhancements of Raman scattering from graphene on two-dimensional photonic crystals using double resonances, which originate from simultaneous enhancements by a localized guided mode and a cavity mode. By adjusting the photonic crystal cavity parameters, the double resonance can be tuned to the G' Raman scattering. Excitation wavelength dependence measurements show a large Raman peak enhancement when the excitation and emission wavelengths meet the double resonance condition. Furthermore, spatial imaging measurements are performed to confirm that the enhancement is localized at the cavity, and we find that the enhanced Raman intensity is 60 times larger compared to the on-substrate Raman signal. The observed cavity enhancement of Raman scattering opens up new possibilities for the development of graphene-based light sources for silicon photonics.
1400	<strong>A facile SERS substrate based on silver deposited sandpaper</strong>	Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a hot topic in recent years, which has wide application prospect and high academic value. Flexible and active SERS substrate was prepared by modification of sandpaper with silver nanoparticles. With the condition of 633 nanometer excitation wavelength, the SERS enhancement effect of the sandpaper which was treated with silver nanoparticles was evaluated by collecting Raman signals of different concentrations of silver nanoparticles and 4-MBA solution. The results demonstrate that the SERS enhancement effect of white(12000 meshes) and pink (8000 meshes) sandpaper is better under the same condition; when the concentration of probe molecule is 10<sup>-4 </sup>moL/L, white sandpaper has the best SERS enhancement; the Raman scattering spectrum has better signal when the silver sol is 15 &mu;L.
1401	<strong>Rapid Synthesis of Nano-Crystalline CZTS Ink by Microwave Assisted Method for Photo voltaic Junctions</strong>	Copper Zinc Tin Sulphide <strong>(</strong>CZTS) nano crystal (NC) ink was prepared using thiourea as sulphur source by microwave assisted process. Thin films fabricated by doctor blading/drop casting technique were then used to analyze the structure and morphology of the CZTS ink. Variation in the properties of the nanocrystals with varying Zn content in the precursor solution is studied. A Zn/Sn ratio of 1.4 with a Cu/ (Sn + Zn) ratio of 0.8 in the starting solution was identified as an optimum compositional ratio to get good opto- electronic properties. Synthesis of CZTS ink was done in ethylene glycol solvent and in a solvent which is a 1:1 mixture of isopropanol and poly ethylene glycol. The films developed from the latter ink showed better morphological and opto electronic properties. CZTS thin films show absorption coefficient of the order of 10<sup>4</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup> and optical band gap of 1.56 eV. The electrical resistivity was found to be 2.5 X 10<sup>2</sup> &Omega;cm and hole mobility 0.051 cm<sup>2</sup>/ (Vs). Glass/FTO/CdS/CZTS multilayer structures were fabricated to form P-N junctions. A knee voltage of 0.8 V from the I-V characteristics of the PN junction indicates that a good V<sub>oc</sub> can be expected from a solar cell constructed with CZTS ink as absorber layer.
1402	Magnetization reversal and emergent magnetic monopole-like state in square artificial spin ice vertex with defects	We have investigated the micro-magnetic behavior as well as magnetization reversal of dipolar coupled magnetic nanoislands with strong shape anisotropy arranged in a square artificial spin ice geometry. Our zero-temperature simulation results show that metastable two-in two-out state is stabilized at remanence of regular configurations. A complex interplay of defects and dipolar interaction leads to a predictable three-in one-out or three-out one-in higher energy state. Switching of the magnetic states is defined by the reduction of the no. of high-energy head-to-head or tail-to tail magnetic state.
1403	Spectroscopic studies of strong red emitting Sr2SiO4:Eu3+ nanophosphors with high color purity for application in WLED using Judd-Ofelt theory and TL glow curve analysis	Un-doped and Eu<sup>3+</sup> doped Sr<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> nanophosphors were synthesized by self-propagating solution combustion synthesis and are characterised with different material and optical characterisations. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed orthorhombic phase, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the nanophosphors with irregular shape but crystalline in nature. The photoluminescence (PL) excitation, emission spectra and lifetime are thoroughly discussed. The emission spectrum due to the excitation under 260 nm showed better asymmetric ratios than the 393 nm excitation ensuring better color purity. The comparative investigations using commission international del&rsquo;Eclirage (CIE) diagram also established that the color purity of 260 nm excitation is superior with CIE co-ordinates (0.66, 0.34) and is close to NTSC standards. The Judd Ofelt (JO) intensity parameters  were obtained from PL emission spectrum and the JO parameters followed the trend  for all Eu<sup>3+</sup> concentration. The radiative properties such as branching ratios, emission cross section, optical gain and gain bandwidth of optimised concentration are calculated. Photoluminescence lifetimes exhibited bi-exponential nature. Thermoluminescence studies of the nanophosphors were carried out after exposing the samples to gamma irradiation in the dose range 20 Gy &ndash; 10KGy. The kinetic parameters are calculated using general order kinetics and are verified by computerised glow curve de-convolution (CGCD). Thermoluminescence emission spectra and contour plots were analysed that further confirms the emission centres responsible for both the process are same. The optical characterisations supported the fact that the nanophosphors excited at 260 nm have better pertinence towards display and lightning application.
1404	<strong>Observation of size dependent orbital magnetism of single Fe impuritiy in nanocrystalline Pb hosts.</strong>	Employing the time differential perturbed angular distribution (TDPAD) technique we have investigated the local magnetism of single Fe impurity in nanocrystalline Pb matrices, by measuring the local susceptibility and spin relaxtion rate of <sup>54</sup>Fe nuclei. Compared to the nonmagnetic behavior of Fe in bulk Pb host, characterized by independent local susceptibility c<sub>loc</sub>(T), the magnetic response of Fe in the nanocrystalline samples with particle size of 10 nm and below exhibit Curie-Weiss like c<sub>loc</sub>(T) with positive slope, indicating the presence of large orbital magnetic moment on the Fe impurity. The orbital moment of Fe has been estimated to be ~ 1 &micro;<sub>B</sub> for 6 nm nano-Pb. Further investigations are being carried out to understand the emergence of orbital magnetism of Fe in nano-Pb.
1405	Determination of atomic positions and polar direction in the half-Heusler Sb<sub>1-x</sub>Sn<sub>x</sub>Ti<sub>1-y-z</sub>Hf<sub>y</sub>Zr<sub>z</sub>Co using Electron channeling	The variation of the electron induced x-ray emission with crystal direction of an incoming electron beam (channeling) was used to study the crystal site preference of the different elements in a promising thermoelectric half-Heusler material with Sb, Co and Ti as the majority elements, and with lower contents of Hf, Zr and Sn. We confirm experimentally, in accordance with previous assumptions, that Sb and Sn occupy one of the octahedral sites, 4a (0, 0, 0), Ti, Zr and Hf the other octahedral site, 4b (&frac12;, &frac12;, &frac12;), and that Co-atoms occupy the tetrahedral site, 4c (&frac14;, &frac14;, &frac14;) in the cubic spacegroup F&#x02C9;43m. We furthermore observe a strong asymmetry along the polar directions as it should be in a half-Heusler when the Co atoms have a strong preference for one of the two sets of tetrahedral sites. Such asymmetries can not be observed by kinematical diffraction according to Friedel&rsquo;s law, demonstrating that the observation of element characteristic signals under channeling conditions is a unique technique for determining the sense of polar directions and distinguishing crystal symmetry alternatives in small crystal grains and nanocrystals.
1406	<strong>High quality Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>(1-x)</sub>N (x~50%) nanowires with uniform Al content grown directly on sapphire substrate by PA-MBE</strong>	Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>(1-x)</sub>N (x~50%) nanowires are grown directly on c-sapphire substrate by plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy. We show that unlike the planner Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>(1-x)</sub>N (x&gt;0.3) layer where a significant Al inhomogeneity has been observed , Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>(1-x)</sub>N (x~0.5)  nanowires exhibit near atomic scale uniformity across the diameter and length. High resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis confirms single crystal nanowires without any detectable extended defect. We observe that the high temperature growth and the higher V/III ratio (~2.5) compared to that used during the growth of planer layers enhances the diffusion of Al adatoms thus resulting uniform composition of Ga and Al in nanowires.  Our experiments on the growth of AlGaN nanowires by PAMBE technique could pave the way for realizing nitride based deep UV light source without a use of GaN nanowire template which has been the conventional technique for growing AlGaN NWs on Si substrates.
1407	A fabrication process for self-connected horizontal SiGe nanowires	We present in this paper a low thermal budget process for self-connecting horizontal silicon-germanium nanowires. The guided nanowires on amorphous oxide layer has been elaborated by a chemical vapor deposition furnace, using vapor-liquid-solid mechanism, via a gold catalyst. The technological process for guided nanowires, is based on combining: photolithography, dry/wet etching, metal deposition and chemical-mechanical planarization techniques. First, we have optimized the growth parameters on a reference samples with pre-patterned electrodes on SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si substrate. Afterwards, the process has been modified to favor the nanowire growth inside the nanotrenches. The silicon germanium nanowire (SiGe NW) connected the predefined electrodes showed an electrical behavior of an intrinsic SiGe NW.
1408	Two-photon Absorption of Copper Indium Disulfide Quantum Dots: Interpreting the Nonlinear Spectrum	We have interpreted the two-photon absorption spectrum of water-soluble copper indium disulfide QDs with stoichiometry 0.18 (Cu), 0.42 (In), and 2 (S) and average diameter of approximately 2.6 nm. For that, we employed the wavelength-tunable femtosecond Z-scan technique and the parabolic effective-mass approximation model, in which the excitonic transition energies were phenomenologically corrected due to the stoichiometry of the nanocrystal. This model considers a conduction band and three valence sub-bands allowing excitonic transitions via centrosymmetric (&#x0394;l = {plus minus}1, where l is the angular momentum of the absorbing state) and noncentrosymmetric (&#x0394;l = 0) channels. In such case, this became relevant because the CuInS2 QDs with chalcopyrite crystal structure is a noncentrosymmetric semiconductor. Thus, our experimental results pointed out two 2PA allowed bands located at 715 nm (2hv =3.47 eV) and 625 nm (2hv =3.97 eV) with cross sections of (6.3 {plus minus} 1.0) x 102 GM and (4.5 {plus minus} 0.7) x 102 GM, respectively. According to the theoretical model, these 2PA bands can be ascribed to the 1P1/2(h3) &#x2192; 1S3/2(e) (lower energy band) and 1P1/2(hheavy) &#x2192; 1S3/2(e) (90%)/(10 %)1P1/2(hsplit-off) &#x2192; 1P3/2(e) (higher energy band) excitonic transitions. A good agreement (magnitude and spectral position) between the experimental and theoretical data were obtained. However, our experimental data suggest that the higher-energy 2PA band may have other contributions due to the mixing between the heavy- and the light-hole bands, which the effective mass model does not take into consideration.
1409	<strong>Thermal Conductance of a metallic dot Single-Electron Transistor </strong>	Dots are ideal systems to study fundamentals on heat transfer at the nanoscale and promising nanoscale heat-engines and thermal devices. Here, we report on the validation of our theoretical model on the thermal conductance of a metallic dot single-electron transistor (md-SET) by a recent experiment on the low-<em>T</em> thermal conductance. We compare with the experiment, we emphasize the physics interpretation and characteristic values and we apply the model to evaluate the operation the md-SET as heat-switch. Perfect agreement is shown between the calculated and the measured charge conductance <em>G</em>, heat conductance <em>&kappa;</em> and the ratio <em>&kappa;</em><em>/GT</em>. The experimental findings confirm the theoretical predictions on the periodicity of the Coulomb oscillations in the classical regime, the low-<em>T</em> extreme values and the high-<em>T</em> limits of <em>G</em> and <em>&kappa;</em>. The calculated conductances of the md-SET are presented in universal curves from low-T to high-<em>T</em>. It is shown that the md-SET can efficiently operate as a heat switch at temperatures , <em>E<sub>c</sub></em> being the charging energy of the dot.
1410	Nano-kirigami metasurfaces by focused-ion-beam induced close-loop transformation	Reducing fabrication difficulties while maintaining structural complexities and functionalities is one of the key challenges faced by the applications of nanophotonic devices. Here we demonstrate an exotic metasurface by using a simple close-loop nano-kirigami method. Based on the focused-ion-beam (FIB) induced continuous shape transformation of a suspended ultra-thin gold film, pinwheel-like metasurfaces with uniaxial broadband polarization conversion and handedness-sensitive phase properties are readily fabricated. By deliberately patterning the metasurfaces periodically with opposite handedness, high-contrast cross-polarized diffraction, as well as clear photonic spin Hall effect, are successfully observed. The demonstrated new types of metasurfaces, together with their suspended features for reconfiguration potentials, can open up new possibilities for the exploration of functional and reconfigurable micro-/nano-photonic and electronic devices.
1411	<strong>Quantification of free convection within a hemispherical annulus through a Copper-water nanofluid saturated porous medium</strong>	This study quantifies the natural convective exchanges occurring between a dome representing an active electronic component and an isothermal passive cupola. These hemispheres are separated by a porous medium saturated of nanofluid based on pure water and copper nanoparticles. The disc of the cavity could be inclined at an angle ranging from 0&deg; (horizontal disc with dome facing upwards) to 180&deg; (horizontal disc with dome facing downwards). The important surface heat flux generated by the dome leads to high Rayleigh number values reaching 7.29x10<sup>10</sup>. The 3D numerical solution is obtained by means of the volume control method associated to the SIMPLE algorithm. The work examines the influence of the nanofluid-saturated porous medium on heat transfer between the two hemispheres. A correlation is proposed to calculate the Nusselt number for any combination of the inclination angle, the fraction volume, the Rayleigh number and the ratio between the thermal conductivities of the porous medium and the fluid. The wide ranges corresponding to these parameters allow the thermal design of this electronic equipment for various configurations.
1412	Thickness dependence of spin wave dynamics in three-fold nano-ellipse clusters	We present the results of an experimental and theoretical study of spin wave dynamics in three-fold nano-ellipse clusters with closely approaching segments for film thickness from 7.5 nm to 40 nm. Various branches of the spectrum display soft mode behavior. Theoretical simulations involving the dynamic matrix approach are in good agreement with the measured ferromagnetic resonance spectra.
1413	<strong>The negative temperature coefficient, electrical resistivity, and surface morphology of single carbon coated silica nanosprings</strong>	A graphitic carbon, referred to as Graphite from the University of Idaho Thermolyzed Asphalt Reaction (GUITAR), is coated on silica nanosprings and silicon substrates via the pyrolysis of commercial roofing tar at 800 &deg;C in an inert atmosphere. Raman spectroscopic analysis indicates that GUITAR has a nanocrystalline structure consisting of 1 &ndash; 5 nm flakes interconnected via amorphous sp<sup>3</sup> bonded carbon. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images indicate that GUITAR is an agglomeration of carbon nanospheres formed by the accretion of graphitic flakes that form an ~ 90 nm layer. The electrical resistivity of 11 single GUITAR coated nanospring devices were measured over a temperature range of 10 &ndash; 80 &deg;C. The average resistivity and conductivity of all 11 devices at 20 &deg;C was 4.30 &plusmn; 1.32 &times; 10<sup>-3</sup> &#x2126; m and 493 &plusmn; 1.05 S/m, respectively. The GUITAR coated nanospring devices exhibit an average negative temperature coefficient of resistivity at 20 &deg;C of &ndash; 0.00167 &plusmn; 0.000262 &deg;C<sup>-1</sup>, which is consistent with nanocrystalline graphite.
1414	Novel high&#xFF0D;sensitivity racetrack surface plasmon resonance sensor modified by graphene	In order to improve the existing challenges in conventional sensors, including large size, complicated preparation process, and difficulties in filling the sensing media, etc., a novel high&#xFF0D;sensitivity plasmonic resonator sensor, which is composed of two graphene&#xFF0D;modified straight waveguides, two metallic layers, and racetrack nanodisk resonator, is proposed in this study. The transmission characteristics, which are calculated by the finite&#xFF0D;element theory, can be used to further analyze the sensing properties. In addition, after quantitative analysis, the results show that the proposed plasmonic sensor generates two resonance peaks for the different incident wavelength, and both resonance peaks can be tuned by temperature. Optimizing the structural parameters of the resonator, the Q value and the sensitivity, which can reach 21.5<sup> </sup>and 1666.67 nmRIU<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, have better performance than other studies. Furthermore, the temperature sensitivity can achieve 2.33 nm/5&#x2103;, which can be easily applied in the practical detection. This study can broader the road in the field of nanometer&#xFF0D;scale biosensor and temperature sensor, ultrafast real time detection, and resistance to electromagnetic interference.

The modification by Sn in MoS<sub>2</sub>/C nanosheets is designed, to improve the electrochemical performances. As anodes for sodium ion batteries (SIBs), the electrodes exhibit an initial capacity of 536 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> and maintains 431 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> after 90 cycles at 0.1 A g<sup>-1</sup>.

It provides a new possible for other compound as the potential application of new rechargeable battery.
1416	The effect of pore geometry on the opening profile of DNA molecule sduring translocation	The recent years witnessed significant advances in nanopore technology and the sDNA sequencing. The DNA translocation through nanopores is one of the interesting problems. Translocation of DNA in biological processes involves many constraints, and among them, the pore through which it translocates is worthy of attention. In this manuscript, we construct a cone-shaped pore and use a statistical model to study the opening profile of DNA molecule in the thermal ensemble. How the cone angle (&#x03B8;) or the pore diameter (&#x03B4;) or the fraction of the pairs that are inside or outside the pore affect the thermal stability of the DNA molecule is the content of the current manuscript.
1417	Quantum confinement in ultra-thin gold nanowires: single-electron transport, excitation spectroscopy, and Zeeman splitting	Ultra-thin gold nanowires (AuNWs) were fabricated by wet chemical synthesis that involves a reaction of reduction. Our low-temperature transport measurements revealed the formation of coupled double dots with deformed Coulomb diamonds and quantum confinement. Single-electron transport leads to excitation spectroscopy, in particular Zeeman splitting of single-particle energy levels in AuNW quantum dots under magnetic fields. Furthermore, spin&ndash;orbit coupling strongly suppresses the estimated <em>g</em>-factor, reflecting the ballistic nature of the quantum dots. The realization of quantum confinement with large spin&ndash;orbit coupling effects in metallic wires should pave the way for application in spintronics.
1418	<strong>Temperature dependent photoluminescence of anatase and rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> single crystals: polaron and self-trapped exciton formation</strong>	This article is devoted to the understanding of photogenerated carrier dynamics in TiO2. Our article aims thus to contribute to a clarification of the scenario that governs the carrier dynamics. We base our discussion on the observations and interpretations that can be found in the literature. We complete them with temperature dependent photoluminescence experiments of both rutile and anatase titanium dioxide single crystals between 4K and 200K.Fully characterizing the nature of electronic states and the carrier recombination scenario of bulk TiO2 appears as a first fundamental and necessary step before further studying more complex nanostructured TiO2 architectures. Our work does contribute to a better understanding the nature of the electronic states involved in the carrier dynamics, by clarifying, which physical microscopic processes are dominant in the large amount of proposals that can be found in the literature. We estimate that our measurements give in this respect new and valuable information of the electronic states of these two TiO2 polymorphs.
1419	<strong>Nanofuel droplet combustion: insights into droplet burning time scale, secondary atomisation and coupling of droplet deformations and heat release</strong>	Combustion characteristics of ethanol-water (EW) droplets laden with ceria (CeO<sub>2</sub>) nanoparticles (NPs) are investigated. The present experimental study focuses on three facets of droplet combustion <strong>(i)</strong> burning time scale of droplets with and without NPs, <strong>(ii)</strong> pathways of secondary atomisation due to interface deformations and <strong>(iii)</strong> coupling of droplet shape deformations and flame heat release. A theoretical vaporization timescale is advocated which considers natural convection-based evaporation, mass loss due to daughter droplet ejections, and flow through porous media. Droplets seeded with ceria NPs, exhibit arrested surface undulations although internal ebullition is discernibly enhanced as compared to EW droplets without NPs. Deformations and formation of surface craters in EW droplets are traced to the imbalance between local vapour recoil (due to rapid ethanol vaporisation) and surface tension. Such craters collapse and form high-speed ligaments which eventually break at the tip through Rayleigh-Plateau mechanism. This pathway of secondary atomisation of EW droplets has been elucidated using a modified local weber number  . On the contrary, for nanofuels, bubble rupture is the mechanism behind the surface crater formation. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) technique is utilised for investigating the droplet shape and flame heat release (HR) evolution. POD analysis suggests presence of buoyant flame flickering with NP addition. Variation of modal temporal coefficients indicate the extent of droplet shape and HR coupling. EW droplet shape and HR are found to be a synced system with a phase lag arising from the flame response timescale. However, a weak coupling is detected for nanofuel droplets.
1420	Prediction of ion-induced nanopattern formation using Monte Carlo simulations and comparison to experiments	Ion induced nanopattern formation has been experimentally investigated for many different ion-target combinations and different ion irradiation conditions. Several theories and models have been developed throughout the past years to explain the observed boundary conditions for pattern formation as well as features of the patterns like wavelength, growth rates, shape and amplitudes. To compare specific experiments with the predictions of analytical theories it is necessary to calculate the linear and non-linear coefficients of the respective equation of motion of a surface profile. Monte Carlo simulations of ion solid interaction based on the binary collision approximation provide a very fast, rather universal and accurate way to calculate these coefficients. The universality expresses the broad range of ion species, ion energies and target compositions accessible by the simulations. The coefficients are obtained from the moments of calculated crater functions, describing ion erosion, mass redistribution and ion implantation. In this contribution, we describe how most linear, non-linear and higher order coefficients can be determined from crater function moments. We use the obtained data to compare the results of selected experimental studies with the predictions of theoretical models. We find good quantitative agreement e.g. for irradiation of Si with Ar and Kr ions, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> with Ar and Xe ions, and amorphous carbon with Ne ions.
1421	Scandate Cathode Characterization: Emission Testing, Chemical Analysis and High-Resolution Imaging	This paper describes a comprehensive investigation of the surfaces of scandate cathodes that exhibited excellent performance during close-spaced diode testing. Through high-resolution imaging, it is shown that micron-sized tungsten particles constituting the cathode surface are highly faceted and are decorated with nanoscale Ba/BaO dots, along with larger Sc2O3 and BaAl2O4 particles. The facets of tungsten grains have been determined to be {100}, {110} and {112}, based on Wulff analysis of the tungsten crystal shape. Moreover, {112} facets are prevalent in the Wulff shape, which agrees with the experimentally observed facet surface areas. A model is proposed to account for the amount of metallic Ba that covers the cathode surface at operating temperatures, and which dewets during cooling of the cathode to form nanoscale hemispherical particles that are observed on the W facets after emission testing. According to this model, the coverage of Ba atoms during cathode operation corresponds to 0.5 monolayer, which represents full coverage of the available tungsten surface. Thorough investigation using a range of materials characterization techniques has provided a comprehensive picture of the structure and composition of scandate cathode surfaces. It is noted that these results do not support the existence of a Ba-Sc-O layer occupying the top 10-100 nm of tungsten grain surfaces.
1422	An optical Bragg scattering readout for simultaneous detection of all low-order mechanical modes of gallium nitride nanowires in nanowire arrays	We report the use of optical Bragg scattering and homodyne interferometry to simultaneously measure all the first order cantilever-mode mechanical resonance frequencies and quality factors (Q) of gallium nitride nanowires (GaN NWs) in 100 NW periodic selected-area growth arrays. Hexagonal 2D arrays of 100 GaN NWs with pitch spacings of 350-1100 nm were designed and prepared to allow optical Bragg scattering. The NWs studied have diameters ranging from 100-300 nm, lengths from 3-10 &mu;m, resonance frequencies between 1-10 MHz, and Q-values near 10,000 at 300 K. The system can passively detect the thermally induced Brownian mechanical motion of the NWs and can study driven NW motion, enabling the simultaneous monitoring of hundreds of mechanical resonators in a 10-100 &mu;m<sup>2</sup> area with a single optical beam. The read-out system allows large arrays of NWs to be characterized and applied as e.g. spatially resolved temperature and mass sensors.
1423	Temperature Response of Soft Ionizable Polymer Nanoparticles	Temperature response of luminescent ionizable polymers confined into far from equilibrium nanoparticles without chemical links, was studied using molecular dynamics simulations. These nanoparticles often referred to as polydots, are emerging as a promising tool for nano medicine. Incorporating ionizable groups into these polymers enable bio functionality, however they also affect the delicate balance of interactions that hold these nanoparticles together.  Here polydots formed by a model polymer dialkyl p-phenylene ethynylene (PPE), with varying number of carboxylate groups along the polymer backbone were probed.  We find that increasing temperature results in a dynamic state that allows internal rearrangements and migration of the ionizable groups towards the particle interface, while retaining the overall particle shape.  The dependence of the transition temperature on the surface to volume ratio of these polydots is much stronger than what has previously been observed in polymeric thin films.
1424	Suppression of grey state and optimization of the single photon emission of a colloidal semiconductor at room temperature	The excitation energy dependency of single colloidal CdSe-CdS core-shell nanocrystals is investigated at ambient conditions. It was demonstrated that the photoluminescence blinking effect is totally suppressed by optically exciting nanocrystals with a laser wavelength located at very low absorption spectrum range. The mechanism of this effect is theoretically attributed to excitation of only the core instead of both the core and the shell. The signal to noise ratio and the photons count are also significantly improved and better purity in terms of single photon generation is achieved.
1425	Electronic and magnetic properties of B, Al, N and P impurities in SnC nanoribbons: first-principles study	We report the structural, electronic and some magnetic behavior of the tin carbide (SnC) nanoribbons with the substitutional impurity atoms of boron, aluminum, nitrogen and phosphorus by using density functional theory (DFT) framework. The armchair and zigzag SnC nanoribbons are considered with the 7 and 4 atoms width, respectively. We realized that all of the four impurities prefer to substitute the Sn atom sites which located at the edge of nanoribbon or close to it. Also, the band structures analysis demonstrate that the impurities create extra bands in the region of nanoribbons band gap. So, the spin-down band gap value of the doped 7-ASnCNRs are reduced to 0.218, 0, 1.043 and 1.233 eV for B, Al, N and P atoms, respectively. Moreover, the half metal behavior is observed for the Al-doped 7-ASiCNR. For the 4-ZSnCNR, the impurity atoms could increase the band gap, especially in the spin-up channel. Finally, they introduce a total magnetic moment of 1&micro;<sub>B</sub> into the nonmagnetic 7-ASnCNR and they affect on the magnetic moment of the 4-ZSnCNR.
1426	On the heat transfer effects of nanofluids within rotor-stator cavities	Owing to the rapid development of a number of technological and industrial sectors, high-performance electronic devices are now ubiquitous in modern engineering and industrial applications. Effective heat management is crucial to the smooth operation of such devices and sometimes conventional methods of heat transfer fail to deliver the required performance. Recent advances in the field of nanofluids is a promising route to improving heat-transfer performance, and this is our motivation. We propose two Computational Fluid Dynamics models for a rotor-stator cavity operating at Re&omega; = 1.0 &times; 105 and filled with a fluid that consists of different volume fractions of Al2O3 nanoparticles. The first model simulates the nanofluid mixture using a single-phase transport model, and the second approach uses a two-phase transport model that allows for the relative velocity between the particle and fluid phases. All simulations are conducted using the second-order accurate solver, OpenFOAM, that is based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM) and using Large eddy simulation (LES) methods.s<p>Our results show that the higher volume fractions of Al2O3 nanoparticles can achieve higher heat transfer rates, and at the same time dilute nanoparticle concentrations have subtle effects on the momentum transport of the system. This is an advantage over micro-particle dispersion. Further, we consider the effects of particle forces in the two-phase model, such as Brownian and thermophoresis forces, and suggest that the thermophoresis forces are the dominant effect within the cavity geometry.
1427	Artificial Kerr effect on the self-focusing of laser in a dissipative suspension of metallic nanoparticles	Self-focusing of laser beam propagating through a dissipative suspension of metallic nanoparticles is studied. Impact of imaginary part of nanoparticle polarizability on the optical force and consequently on the particles rearrangement in the presence of laser fields with an initial Gaussian profile is considered. It is shown that the absorption of laser leads to the creation of optical force along the wave propagation direction which can cause longitudinal distribution of nanoparticles. Considering fifth order nonlinearity of wave amplitude that comes from the simultaneous considering of normal Kerr effect produced by the inhomogeneity of refractive index resulted from the ponderomotive force acting on conducting electrons and artificial Kerr nonlinearity caused by the polarization optical force acting on electrically polarized particles, set of differential equations describing nonlinear steady-state evolution of laser beam is derived by using a non-paraxial method. Dynamics of laser for different frequencies is investigated and optimum frequency range for improving focusing property is determined. It is shown that the artificial Kerr effect causes localization of particles near the propagation axis that can substantially reduce the threshold power for occurring self-focusing in comparison with plasma and other rigid plasmonic systems.
1428	<strong>Surface Plasmon Amplification in Refractory Transition Metal Nitrides based Nanoparticle Dimers</strong>	Aggregates of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) are known to show greater electromagnetic field amplification, multiple resonant peaks, and precisely controlled spectral tuning compared to their isolated counterpart. The ability of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) mediated electromagnetic (EM) field amplification is an important criterion for a plasmonic system to act as an efficient <strong>S</strong>urface <strong>E</strong>nhanced <strong>R</strong>aman <strong>S</strong>cattering (SERS) substrate. Conventional coinage metals like gold, silver and copper are most widely used SERS substrates, mainly due to their well-established synthesis process and large Raman signal amplification. However, there is a pressing need to expand the list of plasmonic materials feasible for SERS substrates to match the exponential growth in SERS research. Identification of new plasmonic substrates will reduce the dependence on conventional plasmonic materials and SERS applications will extend into unexplored spectral regions. Moreover, one can circumvent the limitations arising due to the intrinsic nature of conventional plasmonic materials.  <strong>R</strong>efractory <strong>T</strong>ransition <strong>M</strong>etal <strong>N</strong>itrides (RTMN) such as zirconium nitride (ZrN) and titanium nitride (TiN) has emerged as viable alternatives to coinage metals due mainly to, high electron conductivity, suitability for high temperature  applications, optical response in Vis-NIR region, flexible spectral fine-tuning, and bio/CMOS compatibility. This article presents first-ever theoretical assessment of ZrN and TiN nanoparticle dimers for their suitability in enhancing EM field. Moreover, the role of nanoparticle size, embedding medium and inter-particle separation is quantified through fitting relations whose effectiveness is demonstrated by designing RTMN based substrates for selected wavelengths. The present work will provide handy tools to the designers and manufacturers.
1429	Examining tunnel current responses to acoustic excitation for STMs in gaseous environments	Scanning tunneling microscopes are used to examine surfaces and surface properties with sub-nanometer precision. However, this high precision means these microscopes are extremely sensitive to vibration. A large body of work has examined vibration isolation systems that damp any vibration mechanically transmitted from the environment to the microscope through solid material. Less work has examined the effect of acoustic vibrations transmitted from the environment to the microscope through a gaseous atmosphere. For STMs housed in gaseous environments, such as gloveboxes, an understanding of how acoustic noise manifests within the tunneling current is essential to effectively isolate the microscope. In this paper, we examine an acoustic noise signal of a single frequency in order to clearly identify the presence or absence of the peak in the FFT of the STM tunneling current. We demonstrate that during imaging, even though the acoustic noise can significantly degrade the image, the frequency peak of the acoustic noise signal does not clearly appear in the FFT of the tunneling current. Thus, the best way to identify acoustic noise and isolate scanning tunneling microscopes it is while the tips are engaged but not scanning. Further, we achieve atomic resolution on HOPG in a glovebox with the pumps running, demonstrating that acoustic noise can be mitigated using a homemade, foam-lined acoustic shell.
1430	Molecular Self-assembly Strategy for Encapsulation of an Amphipathic &#x03B1;&#x2010;Helical Antimicrobial Peptide into the Different Polymeric and Copolymeric Nanoparticles	Encapsulation of peptide and protein-based drugs in the polymeric nanoparticles is one of the fundamental fields in controlled-release drug delivery systems. The molecular mechanisms of absorption of peptides and proteins to the polymeric nanoparticles are still unknown and there is no precise molecular data on the encapsulation process of peptide and protein-based drugs. In the current study, the self-assembly of different polymers and block copolymers with combinations of the various molecular weight of blocks and the effects of resultant polymer and copolymer nano-micelles on the stability of magainin2, an amphipathic &#x03B1;&#x2010;helical antimicrobial peptide, are investigated by means of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The micelle forming, morphology of micellar aggregations and changes in the first hydration shell of the micelles during micelles formation were explored, as well. The results showed that the peptide binds to the polymer and copolymer micelles and never detaches during the MD simulation time.  In general, all polymers and copolymers simultaneously encapsulated the peptide during micelles formation and had the ability to maintain the helical structure of the peptide, whereas the first hydration shell of the peptide remains unchanged. Among the micelles, the PEG micelles completely encapsulated magainin2 and the native conformation of the peptide was perfectly kept during the encapsulation process. The results also indicated that the aromatic and basic residues of the peptide strongly interact with polymers/copolymers and play the important roles in the encapsulation mechanism. This research will provide a good opportunity in the design of the polymer surfaces for drug delivery applications such as controlled-release peptide delivery systems.
1431	An X-band Saturation Recovery EPR Spectrometer Based on an Arbitrary Waveform Generator	An X-band (ca. 9-10 GHz) saturation recovery spectrometer to measure electron spin-lattice relaxation (T1) was designed around an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG). The AWG is the microwave source and is used for timing of microwave pulses, generation of control signals, and digitizer triggering. Use of the AWG substantially simplifies the hardware in the bridge relative to that in conventional spectrometers. The bridge includes selectable paths with differing power amplification to permit experiments requiring hundreds of milliwatts to fractions of nanowatts for the pump and observe channels. The signal is detected with either a double balanced or quadrature mixer. Resonator tuning is performed by outputting chirp signals and monitoring the signal from the resonator, with options for either reflection or transmission modes. Two limitations of current AWGs as sources for EPR spectrometers are the low output power and high source noise. The low output power was increased by using low noise microwave amplifiers. The source noise was decreased by addition of a Wenzel high-stability clock. The spectrometer was tested with samples that have T1 between a few hundred ns and hundreds of &#x00B5;s. Signal-to-noise performance is similar to that of a conventional saturation recovery spectrometer with a solid-state source. The bridge design minimizes the number of discrete components, which decreases the footprint. With replacement of frequency-sensitive components, this spectrometer can be used to perform saturation recovery measurements at any frequency within the range of the AWG.
1432	<strong>Modified dielectric and magnetic properties of Fe and Co substituted TbMnO<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles</strong>	Structural, dielectric, conductive and magnetic properties of TbMn<sub>1-<em>x</em></sub>Co<em><sub>x</sub></em>O<sub>3</sub> and TbMn<sub>1-<em>x</em></sub>Fe<em><sub>x</sub></em>O<sub>3</sub> (<em>x</em> = 0.1 and 0.2) nanoparticles (NPs) prepared by the sol-gel method have been studied. Room temperature x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reveal formation of the pure crystalline orthorhombic phase. Transmission electron microscopic images of doped samples show particles with average size of 30 nm. Temperature dependent dielectric curves of all samples exhibit an increment of dielectric constant and loss with increase in doping concentration. Frequency dependent conductivity curves exhibit two different dispersive regions due to grain boundary and grain relaxations along with a frequency independent part all obeying the Jonscher&rsquo;s power law. Frequency dependent impedance spectra and Cole-Cole plots of all samples corroborate the presence of grain and grain boundary relaxations and their temperature dependence follow the Arrhenius relation. Temperature dependent magnetization curve of each sample exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering of both Tb and Mn moments along with a ferromagnetic interaction in the Co-doped sample with <em>x</em> = 0.2. Magnetic hysteresis loops (at 5 K) of all samples show reduction in magnetization value in the doped samples. Conversely, coercivity is found to increase after Co and Fe doping.
1433	Surface plasmon-enhanced UV-emission from ZnO by aluminum bowtie nanoantenna arrays	Aluminum bowtie nanoantenna arrays fabricated by colloid lithography followed by oxygen plasma processing were used to demonstrate the localized-surface-plasmon enhancement of UV light emission from ZnO grown by atomic layer deposition. 4-fold photoluminescence enhancement in the peak of the near band edge emissions was obtained by introducing Al nanotriangles with the gap distance of 31nm by accurate control of the time of oxygen plasma treatment. Extinction spectra and theoretical simulations showed that this improvement benefited from the resonance coupling between the surface plasmons and the excitons of ZnO and the tremendously elevated local electromagnetic fields across the gaps. This cost-effective and facile approach paves an attractive way for high performance optoelectronic devices.
1434	Strain driven magnetic and electronic properties of Zn doped Fe3O4 nano-hollow spheres	We synthesized ZnxFe3-xO4 nano-holllow spheres (NHSs), a promising functional material for spintronic devices. Temperature dependent magnetic studies indicate increase in saturation magnetization Ms with Zn doping, attaining a maximum at x=0.2. The strain developed due to Yafet-Kittel angle reduced Ms with further increase in doping. Dynamic magnetic property studied analyzing ac susceptibility data revealed spin cluster interaction in our systems. Investigation of dielectric property as a function of temperature over a frequency range of 10 KHz-100 MHz by analyzing dielectric spectroscopy, dielectric loss and ac electrical conductivity indicates that the dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity decrease with increasing Zn content.
1435	Functional inkjet-printed silver top electrodes on Pb(Zr<sub>0.53</sub>Ti<sub>0.47</sub>)O<sub>3</sub> thin films	Herein, we describe direct patterning of silver top electrodes on polycrystalline Pb(Zr<sub>0.53</sub>Ti<sub>0.47</sub>)O<sub>3</sub> (PZT) thin films via inkjet printing. The films were deposited on platinized silicon via chemical solution deposition. Individual nanosilver ink droplets were then printed on the PZT surface to create round top electrodes with tunable diameter from 75 to 93 &#x00B5;m. Printing parameters were optimized for deposition of homogeneous electrodes. High-quality of the electrodes sintered at 350 {degree sign}C is confirmed via measurements of the direct piezoelectric response and polarization loops of PZT thin films, whose results are comparable to the ones obtained for sputtered platinum top electrodes.
1436	Carbon NanoDots: Opportunities and limitations of carbon nanodots to study their biodistribution at the human lung epithelial tissue barrier	Inhalation of combustion-derived ultrafine particles ({less than or equal to}0.1 &#x03BC;m) has been found to be associated with pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. Correlation of carbon-based particle physico-chemical properties such as surface charge and agglomeration state with adverse health effects are, however, not yet elucidated, mainly due to limitations related to detection of carbon particles in biological environments. We have therefore applied model particles, i.e. carbon nanodots, mimicking simplified particles derived from incomplete combustions with different surface modifications and fluorescent properties to assess their biodistribution in a three dimensional (3D) lung epithelial tissue model. sThree different carbon nanodots (CNDs) namely nitrogen, sulphur co-doped CNDs (N,S-CNDs) and nitrogen doped CNDs (N-CNDs-1 and N-CNDs-2) were prepared by microwave-assisted hydrothermal carbonization using different precursors or different microwave systems. These CNDs possessed different chemical and photophysical properties. N-CNDs-1 and N-CNDs-2 surfaces were positively charged or neutral, respectively, arguably due to the presence of amine and amide groups while N,S-CNDs surface were negatively charged possessing, in addition to amine / amide groups, also carboxylic groups. Photophysical measurements showed that these three types of CNDs displayed a strong photon absorption in the UV range. Both N-CNDs-1 and N,S-CNDs emitted low fluorescence emission whereas N-CNDs-2 showed high emission.sThe 3D human lung model composed of epithelial cells (A549 cell line) and two primary immune cells, i.e. macrophages and dendritic cells, was exposed to CNDs via pseudo-air liquid interface (ALI) at a concentration of 100 &#x00B5;g/mL. Exposure of these particles did not induce any harmful effect to the cells 24 h after exposure as assessed by cell morphology, cytotoxicity and pro-inflammatory cytokine (tumour necrosis factor-&#x03B1;) release. Distribution of the CNDs in the lung model was estimated by measuring the fluorescent intensity in three different fractions, e.g. apical, intracellular and basal, after 1, 4 and 24 h of incubation, whereas reliable results could be obtained for N-CNDs-2 only. It was shown that N-CNDs-2 were found to translocate rapidly, i.e. &gt; 40% in the basal fraction within 1 h and almost 100% after 4 h, while N-CNDs-1 and N,S-CNDs were still located on the apical surface of the lung cells, i.e. about 80% after 1 h. This could be attributed to agglomeration behaviour of N-CNDs-1 or N,S-CNDs. Surface properties of N-CNDs exhibiting amino and amide groups induce more uptake as N-CNDs could be detected intracellularly. This was less evident for N,S-CNDs with carboxylic acid groups on the surface. In conclusion, CNDs have been designed as a model system for carbon-based particles, however, their small size and agglomeration behavior made fluorescent measurement as a method for quantification challenging. Nevertheless it could be demonstrated that surface properties and agglomeration affected the biodistribution at the lung epithelial barrier in vitro.
1437	Osmosis through a Semi-permeable Membrane: a Consistent Approach to Interactions	The movement of ionic solutions is an essential part of biology and technology. Fluidics, from nano- to micro- to microfluidics, is a burgeoning area of technology which is all about the movement of ionic solutions, on various scales. Many cells, tissues, and organs of animals and plants depend on osmosis, as the movement of fluids is called in biology. Indeed, the movement of fluids through channel proteins (that have a hole down their middle) is fluidics on an atomic scale. Ionic fluids are complex fluids, with energy stored in many ways. Ionic fluids flow driven by gradients of concentration, chemical and electrical potential, and hydrostatic pressure. Each flow is classically described by its own field theory, independent of the others, but of course, in reality every gradient drives every kind of flow to a varying extent. Combining field equations is tricky and so the theory of complex fluids derives the equations, rather than assumes their interactions. When field equations are derived, rather than assumed, their variables are consistent. That is to say all variables satisfy all equations under all conditions with one set of parameters. Here we treat a classical osmotic cell in this spirit, using a sharp interface method to derive interface boundary conditions consistent with all flows and fields. We allow volume to change with concentration, since changes of volume are a property of ionic solutions known to all who make them in the laboratory. We consider flexible and inflexible membranes. We show how to combine the energetics of the membrane with the energetics of the surrounding complex fluids. The results seem general but need application to specific situations of technological, biological and experimental importance before the consequences of consistency can be understood.
1438	<strong><strong>Angle dependent localized surface plasmon resonance from silver nanoparticles embedded in SiO<sub>2</sub> thin film</strong></strong>	<SPAN style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 150%;">Near surface silver nanoparticles embedded in silicon oxide were obtained by 40 keV silver negative ion implantation without the requirement of an annealing step. Ion beam induced local heating within the film leads to an exo-diffusion of the silver ions towards the film surface resulting in the protrusion of larger nanoparticles. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (XTEM) reveals the presence of poly-disperse nanoparticles (NPs), ranging between 2 nm-20 nm, at different depths of the SiO<sub>2</sub> film. The normal incidence reflectance spectrum shows a double kink feature in the vicinity of 400nm, indicating a strong localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) from the embedded NPs. However, due to overlap of the bilayer interference and LSPR, the related features are difficult to separate. The ambiguity in associating the correct kink with the LSPR related absorption is cleared with the use of transfer matrix simulations in combination with an effective medium approximation. The simulations are further verified with angle dependent reflectance measurements. Additionally, transfer matrix simulation is also used to calculate the electric field intensity profile through the depth of the film, wherein an enhanced electric field intensity is predicted at the surface of the implanted films.</SPAN>
1439	<strong>Coercivity enhancement in heavy rare earth-free NdFeB magnets by grain boundary diffusion process</strong>	Grain boundary diffusion of a Pr<sub>3</sub>(Co,Cu) eutectic alloy has been performed for coercivity enhancement on Nd-lean Nd<sub>10</sub>Fe<sub>84</sub>B<sub>6</sub> nanocrystalline ribbons. The coercivity increases from 0.5 T to 2.5 T after 6 hours of infiltration at 600 &ordm;C. High resolution electron microscopy and EDX show that the excess a-Fe present in the initial samples diminishes during infiltration, giving rise to the formation of a RE-rich RE-Fe inter-boundary phase and a layer of (Nd,Pr)<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>14</sub>B close to the surface of the hard magnetic grains. Such microstructure favours the coercivity by increasing the nucleation field for reversal magnetization and providing magnetically isolated/decoupled hard grains.
1440	<strong>Fermi level De-pinning for Dopant-free Silicon Solar Cells</strong>	Fermi level (E<sub>F</sub>) depinning is shown to be critical for the design of selective asymmetric electrode photovoltaic cells, and to be clearly much less than the electron affinity rule estimate. The degree of Fermi level pinning is calculated by density function calculations for the cases of 0, 1 and 2 layers of a representative oxide HfO<sub>2</sub> inserted between a metal layer and a Si substrate. It is found that two layers of HfO<sub>2</sub> is enough to depin E<sub>F</sub> sufficiently to allow typical electrodes of MoO<sub>3</sub> and nanostructured ZnO/silicate to give a potential difference as large as the Si band gap.
1441	Influence of Solvent Quality on Conformations of Crowded Polymers	The structure and function of polymers in confined environments, e.g., biopolymers in the cytoplasm of a cell, are strongly affected by macromolecular crowding. To explore the influence of solvent quality on conformations of crowded polymers, we model polymers as penetrable ellipsoids, whose shape fluctuations are governed by the statistics of self-avoiding walks, appropriate for a polymer in a good solvent. Within this coarse-grained model, we perform Monte Carlo simulations of mixtures of polymers and hard-nanosphere crowders, including trial changes in polymer size and shape. Penetration of polymers by crowders is incorporated via a free energy cost predicted by polymer field theory. To analyze the impact of crowding on polymer conformations in different solvents, we compute average polymer shape distributions, radius of gyration, volume, and asphericity over ranges of polymer-to-crowder size ratio and crowder volume fraction. The simulation results are accurately predicted by a free-volume theory of polymer crowding. Comparison of results for polymers in good and theta solvents indicates that excluded-volume interactions between polymer segments significantly affect crowding, especially in the protein limit of small crowders. Our approach may help to motivate future experimental studies of polymers in crowded environments, with possible relevance for drug delivery and gene therapy.
1442	<strong>Simultaneous Arrayed Formation of Single-Electron Transistors Using Electromigration in Series-Connected Nanogaps</strong>	A field-emission-induced electromigration method (activation) is reported for integrating single-electron transistors operating at T = 298 K. The field emission currents between the two opposite electrodes of each series-connected nanogap are tuned to accumulate Ni atoms within the gaps. For ten series-connected nanogaps, the resistance (<em>V</em><sub>D</sub>/<em>I</em><sub>D</sub>), obtained using the current-voltage (<em>I</em><sub>D</sub>-<em>V</em><sub>D</sub>) properties of these nanogaps during the activation procedure, is observed to decrease on activation. As a result, island structures are formed within the gaps, and the nanogap-based single-electron transistors can be integrated, when atom migration occurs at the tip of each nanogap electrode. After activating the ten series-connected nanogaps with a preset current, <em>I</em><sub>S</sub> = 1 nA, current suppression (representative of coulomb blockade) is not observed in the fabricated devices. On the other hand, coulomb blockade, which depicts the charging and discharging of the nanoislands, can be observed at room temperature, after activation with a preset current, <em>I</em><sub>S</sub> = 150 nA. Furthermore, the modulation properties of the coulomb blockade voltage by the gate voltage are also determined at room temperature. These results experimentally demonstrate the arrayed formation of ten single-electron transistors operating at room temperature, constituting a significant step toward the practical realization of single-electron-transistor-based systems.
1443	<strong>TiN-nanorod/carbon fiber composite structure cathode for plasma-induced field emission</strong>	The remaining challenges confronting high-current pulsed beam sources stimulate the development of robust plasma cold cathodes. A TiN nanorod/carbon fiber cathode was prepared by hydrothermal method and nitriding. The light emission and plasma formation on the cathode surface were compared between carbon fiber cathode and TiN nanorod/cabon fiber cathode. The uniform and large-area plasma was generated on TiN nanorod/cabon fiber cathode, owing to a higher electric field enhancement factor. Further, TiN nanorod/cabon fiber cathode turned on faster, which is inferred by theoretical derivation and temporary evolution of beam currents. TiN nanorod/cabon fiber cathode represents a promising cold cathode with superior performance.
1444	Realization of laser frequency stabilization in sub-nanowatt level using nanofibers	We propose a novel scheme which combines conventional Doppler dichroic atomic vapor laser lock (DAVLL) and nanofiber techniques for realizing frequency stabilization with sub-nanowatt laser power. The dependences of DAVLL signal on the total incident power of probe light and the quantification magnetic field amplitude indicate that the power for frequency stabilization could be minimized to only 15 pW. To evaluate the frequency stability of the locked laser, we calculate the Allan standard deviation,which shows that the relative frequency stability could reach 10<sup>-10</sup> level at 10 seconds. This frequency stabilization scheme paves the road for future quantum optical device integration.
1445	<strong>Local magnetostriction measurement in a cobalt thin film using scanning probe microscopy</strong>	The local magnetostriction measurement has become an emerging issue because strain-mediated nanocomposites have received considerable attention due to their potential applications for high sensitivity sensors and high density energy harvesters. Compared to many instruments capable of measuring nanometric magnetic domains, techniques for measuring local magnetostriction have been rarely reported. Here, we introduce a local magnetostriction measurement method by modifying an atomic force microscope (AFM) by combing a solenoid to apply an external <em>ac</em> magnetic field and induce magnetostrictive excitation. The distribution of magnetostrictive response is mapped by contact mode AFM and lock-in detection techniques with a few nanometer lateral resolution. We have found that a few micrometer-size domains of a cobalt film showing different amplitude and phase signals of the magnetostrictive response are observed by the second-harmonic response of the <em>ac</em> magnetic field frequency, which is not detected in a linear response signal. We suggest that the phase and amplitude signals observed in each domain are related to magnetic-easy-axis directions. Our findings provide a unique pathway to understand the local magnetostrictive response based on scanning probe microscopy.
1446	<strong>Generation of UV-induced radiation defects in calcite</strong>	The effect of UV light on the most common mineral on Earth &ndash; calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), has been little investigated, despite its significant implications for many areas of research, such as photodegradation of CaCO<sub>3</sub>-containing materials, conservation of historical objects, dosimetry and dating. In this study, conducted on nano- and micro-grained calcite samples using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy, we provide a detailed analysis of the radiation defects (paramagnetic centers) generated by UV radiation, including their identification, location (surface- or bulk-related) and stability during the period up to 4 years after irradiation. The observed paramagnetic centers, such as isotropic and anisotropic CO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, SO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, SO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup> ions, are analogous to gamma-induced species, which contradicts a widely-held belief that low-energy radiation cannot create radiation defects in wide band-gap materials, such as calcite. We present a mechanism of UV-induced generation of carbonate paramagnetic species in calcite based on retrapping the &lsquo;secondary electrons&rsquo;, i.e. the electrons released from non-carbonate traps by UV light. The efficiency of this process is strongly connected with the size and morphology of calcite grains, which can be especially relevant, considering the variety of CaCO<sub>3</sub> particles used in the industry and available in nature.
1447	Wafer-scale Photolithography of Scanning Nanocantilevers	The detection of small forces using singly-clamped cantilevers is a fundamental feature of scanning probe force microscopy in all its variant forms. In these technologies, silicon-based nanomechanical devices continue to be the most widespread high-performance nanomechanical sensors for their availability, ease of fabrication, an inherently low mechanical dissipation, and well-controlled surface mechanical dissipation. Here, we develop a robust method to batch fabricate extreme-aspect-ratio (10^3), singly-clamped scanning nanowire mechanical resonators from plain bulk silicon wafers using standard photolithography. We discuss the superior performance and additional versatility of the approach beyond what can be achieved using the established silicon-on-oxide (SOI) technology.
1448	<strong>Coupled plasmon in the rounded Ag Hexagonal Nanoplate Dimer</strong>	The subtle changes in the edges and corners of nanoparticles are the common occurrence during the manufacturing process of them which it affects on the nanoparticle's sensing properties. In this work, We studied rounding effect on sensing properties by numerical simulation of silver hexagonal nanoplate dimer. In these nanoplates three main plasmonic bands arise (dipole, octupole and anti-bonding modes). Both dipole and octupole modes are strongly affected by changes in the refractive index of the medium and blue shift under the influence of the edges rounding. Our results show that hexagonal dimers with the least gap distance (<em>g </em>= 1nm) have the largest extinction cross section and the maximum hybridization of plasmon peak. Furthermore, our results show that octupole mode has the highest FOM in both types of perfect and rounded hexagonal nanoplates dimer, and the FOM of the rounded hexagonal dimer is less than the perfect hexagonal nanoplate dimers. This study may be used to build more advanced sensing devices based on metallic nanoparticles.
1449	Contrastive analysis of Hydrothermal and Co-precipitation synthesized CeO2 NPs for various biomedical applications	The foolproof work has been analyzed for the synthesis of Cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles (NPs) via hydrothermal and co-precipitation methods. We emphasize the highly adequate hydrothermal method in synthesizing CeO2 NPs for biomedical applications against Gram strain bacteria. Absorption spectral investigation at 283 nm and 274 nm confirms the formation of CeO2 NPs for hydrothermal (HYNPs) and co-precipitation (CONPs) methods respectively. Functional group analysis firmly reveals the akin conjugation of the presence of organic and inorganic species in the synthesized CeO2 NPs. Cubic structure and average crystallite size of synthesized NPs are estimated using Sherrer's and W-H methods. Obtained average particles size is compared with HR-TEM to be 10 nm and 5 nm using hydrothermal and co-precipitation methods respectively. Consequently, synthesized CeO2 NPs shows excellent antimicrobial activities. Moreover, HYNPs gave promising antioxidant activity with lowest IC50 as compared with CONPs. Owing to the biological active nature of CeO2 NPs, HYNPs acts as a best therapeutic agent in biomedical applications as important antibiotics.
1450	The generation and evolution of a diffuse nanosecond pulsed dielectric barrier discharge in airflows	Atmospheric-pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) with airflow participation has been widely used in recent years. In this experimental study, diffuse DBD excited by repetitive nanosecond pulses is achieved in airflow. On the introduction of airflow to the gas gap, the discharge state transforms from a filamentary one into a diffuse one at first, followed by the generation of a thin filamentary discharge at a high airflow rate. It is observed that the diffuse discharge and the thin filamentary discharge are ignited from the electrode boundary, subsequently move towards the downstream region with a velocity below the corresponding airflow rate. Subsequent to hundreds of pulse cycles, a stationary discharge state is formed with the thin filamentary discharge in the upstream region and the diffuse discharge in the downstream region. The length of the thin filamentary discharge region is associated with the airflow rate, pulse repetition frequency, and applied voltage. The observations presented above are ascribed to the transverse electric field at the electrode boundary and the redistribution of charges under the action of airflow.
1451	<strong>In-situ water-assisted structural-manipulation of C1s sp<sup>3</sup>-characteristics in ferromagnetically-filled carbon onions: the case of high pressure Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> Bbmm</strong>	Carbon nano-onions (CNOs) are quasi-spherical fullerene-like structures with 60N<sup>2</sup> carbon atoms (N being the number of carbon layers) self-arranged in carbon shells. Reversible controlled transformations of these nanostructures into nanodiamonds (CNDs) have been recently demonstrated by using a laser wavelength of 532 nm for timescales of 40 min (CNOs to CNDs transformation). However, no studies have yet reported the dynamics of such transitions in metal/carbide filled CNOs (Me-C@CNOs). In this work we have investigated such structural transitions in the case of Fe-C@CNOs with controlled curvature. We find that no CNOs to CNDs conversion is present under prolonged laser-beam irradiation at the temperature of 673 K. Instead a novel re-crystallization effect which leads to progressive increase in the intensities of the D, G and 2D bands is present. This observation is supported by controlled temperature dependent X-ray diffraction measurements in vacuum. In the attempt to control the sp<sup>3</sup> characteristics of the CNOs-shells we have then developed an advanced fabrication method where the controlled addition of water to ferrocene allows to profoundly enhance the sp<sup>3 </sup>carbon-characteristics of the CNOs by progressive oxidation of the encapsulated particles into a high pressure Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> phase.
1452	Saturation Scattering Competition for Non-fluorescence Single-wavelength Super-resolution Imaging	Stimulated emission depletion nanoscopy and its derivatives based on saturation induced competition effects have become an indispensable tool for studying cellular events and their dynamics in living conditions. However, the successful implementation of these techniques heavily relies on the saturation and competition nature of excited fluorescent dyes exerted by two laser beams of the different wavelength, which perplexes the optical system and inevitably suffers from photobleaching effects. Harnessing the emerging saturation scattering of plasmonic nanoparticles, here, we demonstrate a novel fluorescence-free single-wavelength super-resolution imaging technique using gold nanoparticles. A lateral resolution of 101.2 nm (&lt;&#x03BB;/5) is achieved through introducing saturation scattering competition (SSC) of 60 nm gold nanospheres between dual beams at the same wavelength. In addition, the SSC drastically reduces the saturation intensity by three orders of magnitude than conventional STED process at comparable resolutions. As a proof of concept, we realized robust single-wavelength super-resolved imaging in MG-63 cells with a simplified system. The current technique provides a new modality of biosample-friendly technology for optical super-resolution imaging.
1453	Quantitative phase imaging of cells in flow	Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) offers high optical path length sensitivity, probing nanoscale features of live cells, but it is typically limited to imaging just a few static cells at a time.  To enable utility as a biomedical diagnostic modality, higher throughput is needed.  To meet this need, we have developed methods for imaging cells in flow using QPI.  Here we present our digital holography approach for imaging cells with an emphasis on the issues required for imaging moving cells.  In particular, the issue of choosing a quantitative criterion for digitally refocusing cell images will be examined.  Examples of holographic images of flowing red blood cells are presented and analyzed.
1454	Energy filtering in silicon nanowires with a geometric superlattice for steep-slope transistors	This paper investigates energy filtering in silicon nanowires by resonant electron tunneling through a geometric superlattice. A geometric superlattice is any kind of periodic geometric feature along the transport direction of the nanowire. Multivalley quantum-transport simulations are used to demonstrate the manifestation of minibands and minibandgaps in the transmission spectra of such a superlattice. We find that the presence of different valleys in the conduction band of silicon favors a nanowire with a rectangular cross-section for effective energy filtering. The obtained energy filter can consequently be used in the source extension of a nanowire field-effect transistor to prevent high-energy electrons from contributing to the leakage current. Self-consistent Schr&ouml;dinger-Poisson simulations in the ballistic limit show a sub-60 mV/decade inverse subthreshold slope for a nanowire with side-indentations. The adaptation of the quantum transmitting boundary method (QTBM) to the finite-element simulation of 3D structures with anisotropic effective mass is presented in the appendix. Our results bare relevance in the search for steep-slope transistor alternatives which are compatible with the silicon industry and can overcome the power-consumption bottleneck inherent to standard CMOS technologies.
1455	<strong>Optoelectronic Properties of Calcium Cobalt Oxide Misfit Nanotubes</strong>	We report on the optoelectronic properties of a recently discovered nanotubular phase of misfit-layered calcium cobalt oxide, CaCO<sub>2</sub>&ndash;CoO<sub>2</sub>. Individual nanotubes are investigated by spatially resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy experiments performed in a transmission electron microscope and complementary first-principles, time-dependent hybrid density-functional theory calculations are performed to elucidate the electronic structure and optical spectra. We find that the band gap is independent of the geometry of the nanotubes, and experimental and calculated results independently confirm an optical gap of 1.9&ndash;2.1 eV for the CaCO<sub>2</sub>&ndash;CoO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes. The time-dependent hybrid density-functional theory calculations also suggest the existence of strongly bound intralayer excitons (up to 0.5 eV binding energy), which could allow for optoelectronic applications of these nanotubes at near-infrared to visible (~1.5&ndash;2 eV) wavelengths.
1456	Enhanced Thermoelectric Properties of Flexible Aerosol-Jet Printed Carbon Nanotube-based Nanocomposites	Aerosol-jet printing allows functional materials to be printed from inks with a wide range of viscosities and constituent particle sizes onto various substrates, including the printing of organic thermoelectric materials on flexible substrates for low-grade thermal energy harvesting. However, these materials typically suffer from relatively poor thermoelectric performance, due to their low Seebeck coefficient, S, and electrical conductivity, &#x03C3;. Here, we demonstrate a modified aerosol-jet printing technique that simultaneously incorporates well dispersed high S Sb2Te3 nanoflakes, and high-&#x03C3; multi-walled carbon nanotubes providing good inter-particle connectivity, to significantly enhance the thermoelectric performance of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate structures on flexible polyimide substrates.
1457	<strong>Controlled hydrothermal temperature brings tunable permittivity and electromagnetic absorption performance of reduced graphene oxide</strong>	Hydrothermal reduction method has been chosen to prepare reduced graphene oxide (RGO), the results reveal that controlled reaction temperature brings tunable permittivity and ideal electromagnetic absorption (EA) performance of pure RGO. A composite loaded with 5 wt% of RGO can possess an effective EA bandwidth of 7.56 GHz from 2.9 to 3.2 mm, when graphene oxide (GO) was reduced under 160 <sup>&deg;</sup>C for 6 h. Meanwhile, as-prepared RGO can effectively dissipate incident electromagnetic energy in the whole X (8-12 GHz) and Ku (12-18 GHz) bands. This study shows that RGO can achieve ideal EA performance without any other decorated nanomaterials.
1458	Effect of nanoparticles on streamer and breakdown of vegetable oil impregnated pressboard in non-uniform electric field	Electrical equipment is always subjected to various of operating conductions and voltage waves which cause insulation failure on the surface of pressboard (PB). In this paper, pre-breakdown streamers of surface discharge on the interface of PB in vegetable oil based Fe3O4 nanofluids (NF) were observed by the shadowgraph method under lightning impulse voltage. The images indicate that streamers of NF impregnated PB show more branches than that of pure oil impregnated PB. The stopping length of streamers propagation is calculated by shadowgraph images for NF and pure oil. Results suggest that the stopping length of NF impregnated PB is shorter under the same extra voltage. Secondary reverse streamer is generated at the dissipation process by the reverse electric field, which is caused by residual space charge imparted by primary streamer. Results indicate that the Fe3O4 nanoparticles have reduced the length of secondary reverse streamer. The positive and negative lightning breakdown voltage of Fe3O4 NF impregnated PB is increased by 24% and 12% at 50mm gap, respectively. In addition, nanoparticles effectively have changed the electric field distribution resulting in the alleviation of streamer concentrated along the parallel direction of PB, and increased the lightning impulse breakdown voltage.
1459	<strong>Deformation Behavior at Sliding Interface for Nanoscratch of Aluminum in Dry, Water and Aqueous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Conditions</strong>	Nanoscale deformation behavior of aluminum at sliding interface was investigated by nanoscratch experiment and X-ray photoelectron spec-troscopy (XPS) in variable conditions involving dry, water and aqueous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. It was found that deformation of aluminum in the nanoscratch process could be divided into two regimes relying on the evolution of frictional coefficient. Similar results have been observed in dry and water conditions. However, the stick-slip behavior is integrated into deformation process with aqueous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> compared with the results of that in dry and water conditions, resulting from the formation and breaking of chemical bonds interaction of OH and Al atom. In addition, this deformation behavior is described in the framework of a mathematical model based on Mo&rsquo;s theory using the atomic contact concept instead of asperity contact, which relates the transition of friction from sub-linear to linear and deformation changing from elastic to changing elastic-plastic. Finally, a parameter of critical energy barrier is employed to reveal the atomic material removal mechanism in Al chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process with the consideration of chemical actions and elastic deformation.
1460	Density and viscosity profiles governing nanochannel flow	The density and viscosity profiles across the nanochannel height were respectively compared between the flow factor approach model and molecular dynamics simulation for the Poiseuille flow in a nanochannel, when the agreements between these two approaches were good in calculating both the flow velocity profile across the channel height and the volume flow rate through the channel. It was found that except close to the confining wall, the comparisons in the two regards showed satisfactory agreements; Because of the solidification of the thin layer close to the wall, the errors of the flow factor approach model in calculating both the local density and local viscosity close to the wall can not considerably affect its calculation accuracy of both the flow velocity profile across the channel height and the volume flow rate through the channel, both of which were actually governed by the density and viscosity profiles of the flowing media in the middle section of the channel height.
1461	Nonlinear Constitutive Models for Nano-scale Heat Conduction	We present a rigorous approach that leads, from a many-particle description, to a nonlinear, stochastic constitutive relation for the modeling of transient heat conduction processes at nanoscale. By enforcing statistical consistency, in that the statistics of the local energy is consistent<br />with that from an all-atom description, we identify the driving force as well as the model parameters in these generalized constitutive models.
1462	Giant enhancement of stimulated Raman amplification in metasurfaces made of silicon photonic crystal nanocavities	We demonstrate that stimulated Raman amplification can be enhanced by more than four orders of magnitude in a silicon metasurface consisting of a periodic distribution of specially engineered photonic crystal cavities in a silicon photonic crystal slab waveguide. In particular, by designing the photonic crystal cavities so as they possess two optical modes separated by the Raman frequency of silicon, one can achieve large optical field enhancement at both the pump and Stokes frequencies. As a consequence, the effective Raman susceptibility of the nonlinear metasurface, calculated using a novel homogenization technique, is significantly larger than the intrinsic Raman susceptibility of silicon. Implications to technological applications of our theoretical study are discussed, too.
1463	Nanometer scale thermal response of polymers to fast thermal perturbations	The non-equilibrium dynamics of polymers at nanosecond and nanometer scales is described by linear integro-differential equations with dynamic heat capacity. The exact analytical solution for the non-equilibrium thermal response of polymers in plane and spherical geometry is obtained. It is found that even fast components of dynamic heat capacity significantly affect the thermal response to local thermal perturbations. A non-equilibrium local overheating in polymers under pulse heating is determined. This local overheating is greatly enhanced by fast components (ca. 1 ns) of dynamic heat capacity. The non-equilibrium and non-linear thermal response of typical polymers with relaxation parameters corresponding to polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) is analyzed. The obtained results can be used for the analysis of the heat transfer process at the early stages of crystallization with fast formation of nanometer scale crystals.
1464	Effective surface tension of liquid marbles using controllable nanoparticle monolayers	A liquid marble&rsquo;s effective surface tension (&gamma;<sub>eff</sub>) is a frequently used but perplexing concept and clarifying this tension has been challenging, mainly due to difficulties in controlling affecting factors from marble surface particles. In this study, we addressed this issue using water marbles covered by nanoparticle monolayers, which substantially removed the control obstacle and resulted in simple physical models. Comparative results reveal that the surface solidity caused by local or overall particle jamming, which is a common phenomenon that has been lightly considered, limits the &gamma;<sub>eff</sub>&rsquo; implication only to macroscopic properties, rather than including interparticle forces as in previous assumptions. Similarly, &gamma;<sub>eff</sub> depends on very specific conditions including the measurement method and all liquid marble parameters; hence, its value can vary significantly even when the particle coverage is similar. The equivalence quality is proposed here that could be an important concept when addressing liquid marbles&rsquo; &gamma;<sub>eff</sub>.
1465	A Transport Isolation by Orbital Hybridization Transformation toward Graphene Nanoribbon-based Nanostructure Integration	Among feature-rich graphene-related materials, graphene nanoribbon-based nanostructures are particularly attractive since they can provide tunable and excellent electronic properties. However, the integration of high quality graphene nanoribbon-based nanostructures on large scale is still an open area. In this paper, a novel idea as transport isolation is proposed. By a construction of different orbital hybridizations of the carbon atoms in graphene, the graphene nanoribbon (GNR) regions and functionalized graphene regions are integrated. In the hybrid system, the functionalized graphene regions play the role of isolation barrier. Based on the first principle calculation, it is demonstrated that about 0.6 nm wide hydrogenated graphene is enough to reliably isolate the GNR regions. Besides, it is revealed that once the armchair GNRs (AGNRs) are fully isolated by functionalized graphene, their band gaps are basically maintained and are weakly dependent on the width of functionalized graphene regions. In addition, the transport characteristics of those isolated AGNRs are verified to be similar to the pristine AGNRs on device level. The above virtues infer our method can effectively produce a reliable isolation, verified by a simulation of device integration demo. We hope it can provide an intriguing option for the integration of graphene nanoribbon-based nanostructures.
1466	<strong><strong>Athermal coalesc</strong><strong><strong>ence of two </strong></strong><strong><strong>parallel and </strong></strong><strong><strong>contacting a</strong></strong><strong><strong>morphous SiO</strong></strong><strong><sub><strong>x</strong></sub></strong><strong><strong> nanowires</strong></strong><strong><strong> as induced by uniform </strong></strong><strong><strong>e</strong></strong><strong><strong>-beam irradiation</strong></strong></strong>	The coalescence of two parallel and contacting amorphous SiO<sub>x</sub> nanowires as induced by uniform electron beam irradiation was <em>in-situ</em> studied at room temperature in a transmission electron microscope. It was observed that the two parallel and contacting nanowires demonstrated a quick athermal coalescence at the contacting surface and nearby, and finally evolved into a single nanowire of a bigger diameter. It was also observed that there is not any detectable atom loss during the coalescence. Based on the observation, a new mechanism of athermal &ldquo;diffusion&rdquo; and plastic flow as driven by the effects of the nanocurature of the amorphous SiO<sub>x</sub> nanowires and the electron beam-induced athermal activation, which were different from the existing knock-on mechanism and e-beam heating effect, was proposed to elucidate the observed phenomena. It is expected that such a study has important implications for the nanoprocessing and nanostability of future nanowire-based structures or devices.
1467	<strong>Hole and electron trapping in HfO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanolaminated stacks</strong>	HfO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanolaminated stacks prepared by atomic layer deposition have been investigated in terms of their charge storage characteristics for possible application in charge trapping memories. Memory window, electron and hole trapping and leakage current mechanisms have been studied in dependence on Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> thickness and post-deposition oxygen annealing. It is shown that in as-deposited stacks hole trapping dominates and it is stronger in stacks with thicker Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. O<sub>2</sub> annealing increases electron trapping thus giving rise to a larger memory window and enhanced charge storage characteristics, i.e. 65 % of charge is retained after ten years and the memory window decreases by 6 % after 2.5x10<sup>4</sup> program/erase cycles. Consideration of leakage current mechanism reveals domination of space charge limited current through deep traps. O<sub>2</sub> annealing increases the density of these traps without changing their energy position.
1468	<strong>Identification and separation of local and nonlocal nonlinear optical effects: Theory and experiment</strong>	Understanding the nonlinear optical effect of novel materials will play a crucial role in the fields of photonics and optoelectronics. Herein, we theoretically and experimentally investigate the concurrence of third-order locally refractive nonlinearity and thermally induced nonlocal nonlinearity saturation. We present the analytical expressions of the Z-scan trace and the number of spatial self-phase modulation (SSPM) rings, which allow one to unambiguously yet conveniently separate the contributions of local and nonlocal nonlinearities in the case that both effects occur simultaneously. As a test, we study both the local and thermally induced nonlocal nonlinearities in fullerene/toluene solution by performing continuous-wave (CW) Z-scan and SSPM measurements at two different wavelengths. This work enriches the physical mechanism of nonlinear optical effect in solution dispersions of nanomaterials which can be exploited for nonlinear photonic devices.
1469	Magnetodynamic and spin-transfer properties of Ni$_{\text{100-x}}$Fe$_{\text{x}}$/Pt nanoconstrictions	We study the magnetodynamic and spin-transfer torque properties of Ni$_{\text{100-x}}$Fe$_{\text{x}}$/Pt ($x$ = 0 to 40) microstrips and nanoconstrictions using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurements. We extracted the spin Hall efficiency by analyzing the lineshape and the linewidth of the ST-FMR signals. We found that the spin Hall efficiency increases as the Fe content increases. The enhancement in  the spin Hall efficiency is correlated with an increase in the spin-mixing conductance and is attributed to the transparency of the FM--Pt interface to the spin current. Our results suggest that the spin current generated via the spin Hall effect can be maximized by engineering the interfaces with higher transparency between the FM-Pt layer which is important for applications such as magnetic nano-oscillators.
1470	Performance analysis of nanostructured Peltier coolers	Employing non-equilibrium quantum transport models, we investigate the details and operating conditions of nano-structured Peltier coolers embedded with an energy filtering barrier. Our investigations point out non-trivial aspects of Peltier cooling which include an inevitable trade-off between the cooling power and the coefficient of performance, the coefficient of performance being high at a low voltage bias and subsequently deteriorating with increasing voltage bias. We point out that there is an optimum energy barrier height for nanowire Peltier coolers at which the cooling performance is optimized. However, for bulk Peltier coolers, the cooling performance is enhanced with the height of the energy filtering barrier. Exploring further, we point out that a degradation in cooling performance with respect to bulk is inevitable as a single moded nanowire transitions to a multi-moded one. The results discussed here can provide theoretical insights for optimal design of nano Peltier coolers.
1471	<strong>Structural, optical and Raman investigation of KFeO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles: A novel material as photo-anode for dye sensitized solar cell</strong>	The present power crisis all around the world urgently demands highly efficient solar cells. More importantly these sources of energy should be environment friendly. In this direction, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have been fabricated using KFeO<sub>2 </sub>nanoparticles as photo-anode material. KFeO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles have been synthesized by sol-gel methods. The structural, morphological, optical and photovoltaic properties of synthesised nanoparticles have been investigated. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) study reveals that the size of nanoparticles is 12 nm. Reitveld refined X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reflects the orthorhombic phase of the synthesized nanoparticles with <em>Pbca</em> space group. The optical study reveals that the band gap of the KFeO<sub>2 </sub>nanoparticle is 1.88 eV. The Raman study discloses that there are three Raman active internal modes viz., A<sub>1g</sub>+E<sub>g</sub>+T<sub>2g</sub> and eleven Raman peaks corresponding to these modes. The CIE (International Commission on Illumination or Commission Internationale de l'&eacute;clairage) diagram and photoluminescence spectra of these nanoparticles have been studied. DSSC have been fabricated using these nanoparticles and photocurrent versus applied voltage study of this suggests that the open-circuit voltage (V<sub>OC</sub>), short circuit current&ndash;density (J<sub>SC</sub>) and fill factor (FF) % of the fabricated DSSC is 0.84 V, 4.72 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and 64, respectively.
1472	<strong>Tunable specific-loss power of magnetic nano-spheres in vortex state for high-efficiency hyperthermia bio-applications</strong>	We explored the reliable control of high-efficiency specific-loss power (SLP) using magnetic nanoparticles in the vortex state, the value of which power is one order of magnitude higher than those of the conventional mechanisms of SLP reported thus far. The underlying mechanism is based on the precession of a single vortex core and subsequent dissipation due to the intrinsic damping when the vortex-state spheres are resonantly excited. Owing to the dynamic characteristics of vortex-state nanoparticles, the resonant excitation of vortex-core precession is variable with particle size as well as tunable by the size-specific resonant frequency and strength of ac magnetic fields applied to the particles. The ac magnetic-field energy absorbed by the particles can be converted very efficiently to other energy forms such as heat. We derived, semi-analytically and by micromagnetic simulations, the quantitative relationships of the SLP quantity with the particle size and intrinsic damping constant of nanoparticles, and with externally controllable parameters including the frequency and strength of ac magnetic fields and dc magnetic-field strength. This work provides a reliable means of control as well as an optimal design of high-value SLP for high-efficiency hyperthermia bio-applications.

1474	Investigation of nano scale additives on performance characteristics of biodiesel in a CI engine	There is a rapid decrease in the sources of fossil fuels due to increased demand in energy. Researchers are focusing on alternative resources of fuels. Inedible vegetable oils are emerging as promising alternative for diesel fuel. But due to several problems, they have to be blended with diesel for their use in engine. In present work two different blends of Thumba biodiesel are prepared and investigated. One blend consists of 20% oil in biodiesel and is termed as B20. The other blend, termed as B19MCE1, consists of low concentration of mesoporous carbon. The results indicate that B19MCE1 blend has lowest brake specific fuel consumption and highest brake thermal efficiency at full load. Also the emissions and exhaust gas temperature are reduced in case of B19MCE1 blend.
1475	Silicon-based polarization analyzer by polarization-frequency mapping	Measuring states of polarizations (SOPs) is a fundamental requirement in high capacity optical communications, optical imaging and materials characterizations. However, most of the existing methods focused on the assembly of spatial optical elements, making the system bulky and complex. Alternatively, the integrated methods were mainly presented by plasmonic nanostructures or metasurfaces, difficult to integrate with commonly used silicon photonic devices. For large-scale inter-chip optical interconnections, the silicon-based polarization analyzers are in demand and in its infancy. Here, a silicon-based polarization analyzer by polarization-frequency mapping is put forward. The basis vectors of polarization are mapped to two frequencies by thermally-tuned phase shifters. The SOPs are retrieved from the frequency domain. The proposed polarization analyzer is demonstrated experimentally and can measure SOPs in entire C-band. The scheme is compatible with CMOS fabrication process, making it possible to be integrated with other silicon-based devices monolithically.
1476	The role of ligand design on nanoparticle and biomolecule interactions	Ligand functionalized inorganic nanoparticles offer great potential as vehicles for in vivo delivery of drugs, genes, and other therapeutics. These nanoparticles offer highly customizable chemistries independent of the size, shape, and functionality imparted by the inorganic core. Their success as drug delivery agents depends on their interaction with three classes of biomolecules: nucleic acids, membranes, and proteins. Experiments have demonstrated the importance of charge and hydrophobicity for biocompability and cell internalization. Ligand length, flexibility, branchedness, and other properties may also influence the delivery efficacy of nanoparticles. However, comprehensive understanding of ligand design principles lies in the cost associated with synthesizing and characterizing diverse ligand chemistries and ability to carefully assess the structural integrity of biomolecules upon interactions with NPs. Here, we discuss recent advances and open questions in the field of nanoparticle ligand design, with a focus on atomic scale interactions with biomolecules.
1477	High-efficiency AlGaN-based multiple quantum wells grown on low dislocation density AlN realized on small-coalescence-area nano-patterned sapphire substrate	Targeting to clarify the control principle of AlN growth on nano-patterned sapphire substrate (NPSS), the growth behaviors of AlN on hexagonal configuration hole-type and truncated-cone-pillar-type NPSS with the same period and mesa width have been investigated. It is found that threading dislocation density (TDD) of AlN grown on the hole-type NPSS reaches 4.87&times;10<sup>8 </sup>cm<sup>-2</sup>,<sup> </sup>that is over one order of magnitude lower than the value 6.63&times;10<sup>9 </sup>cm<sup>-2 </sup>on the pillar-type one. It is verified that the TDD of AlN grown on NPSS is largely dominated by the area ratio of the coalescence zones and thus the NPSS pattern with small coalescence area (SCA) ratio, such as the hexagonal configuration hole-type NPSS, is the preferred choice for high-quality AlN epitaxy. Benefiting from the low-TDD AlN grown on the hole-type NPSS with SCA, the internal quantum efficiency of the 281-nm AlGaN-based multiple quantum wells has reached 73.9% at 300K.
1478	High-density and vertically-aligned GaN nanocolumns grown on graphene using a thin AlN buffer layer	The growth of high-density, vertically-aligned GaN nanocolumns on graphene/silica glass by RF-PAMBE is feasible using a thin AlN buffer layer. AlN serves both as nucleation sites for the nanocolumns and protects the graphene from the N2 plasma and in-plane strain generated by GaN nucleation. The nanocolumns are grown in the c-axis direction with wurtzite structure and exhibit an acceptable verticality. Furthermore, the columnar structure of GaN provides higher photoluminescence intensity than that of a reference HVPE-GaN bulk substrate. These findings are therefore very encouraging for further establishing graphene as an alternative substrate to enhance the performance of III-N-based semiconductor devices.
1479	Rodlike counterions at heterogeneously charged surfaces	We study the spatial and orientational distribution of rodlike counterions (such as mobile nanorods) as well as the effective interaction mediated by them between two plane-parallel surfaces that carry fixed (quenched) heterogeneous charge distributions. The rodlike counterions are assumed to have an internal charge distribution, specified by a multivalent monopolar moment and a finite quadrupolar moment, and the quenched surface charge is assumed to be randomly distributed with equal mean and variance on the two surfaces. While equally charged surfaces are known to repel within the traditional mean-field theories, the presence of multivalent counterions has been shown to cause attractive interactions between uniformly charged surfaces due to the prevalence of strong electrostatic couplings that grow rapidly with the counterion valency. We show that the combined effects due to electrostatic correlations (caused by the coupling between the mean surface field and the multivalent, monopolar, charge valency of counterions) as well as the disorder-induced interactions (caused by the coupling between the surface disorder field and the quadrupolar moment of counterions) lead to much stronger attractive interactions between two randomly charged surfaces. The interaction profile turns out to be a nonmonotonic function of the intersurface separation, displaying an attractive minimum at relatively small separations, where the ensuing attraction can exceed the maximum strong-coupling attraction (produced by multivalent monopolar counterions between uniformly charged surfaces) by more than an order of magnitude.
1480	<strong>Charge transfer induced tunable bandgap and enhanced saturable absorption behaviour in rGO/WO<sub>3</sub> nanorod composites.</strong>	We report the charge transfer from Tungsten trioxide (WO<sub>3</sub>) to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through steady state fluorescence quenching with fitting. Also we report ns nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of GO, WO<sub>3</sub>, and rGO/WO&shy;<sub>3 </sub>at 532 nm employing the open aperture Z-Scan technique. The samples exhibit typical third-order NLO behavior including saturable absorption (SA) and Reverse saturable absorption (RSA). The rGO/WO<sub>3</sub> nanohybrids shows the low saturation intensity I<sub>s </sub>and 0.5x10<sup>11</sup> W/m<sup>2 </sup>compared to the pristine WO<sub>3</sub> saturation intensity I<sub>s</sub> ~1x10<sup>13</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup>. The results display that the effective functionalization and the reduction of GO enhances the SA performance of the nanohybrids. Results show that these nanohybrids are potentially useful for mode locking, optical switching and as a saturable absorber. Moreover the structural property was confirmed by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), UV spectroscopy reveals the bandgap variation due to rGO incorporation. HRTEM supports the nanohybrids as nanorods and the vibrational properties were analyzed by Fourier transformed Infrared Spectroscopy technique.
1481	A Self-Consistent First Order Analytical Model of Plasma Jets: A Two Fluids Approach	Laser ablation processes have applications from thin film deposition to isotope separation, through plasma plume generation, which suggests mass and charge separation of species as the plume evolves. However, it does not have a theoretical model for, that takes into account equilibrium configurations. The present work is dedicated to build a simplified two fluids non-neutral plasma equilibrium self-consistent model, based on few parameters for first and fast analysis of morphological and statistical features for typical experimental plasma plumes. The velocities field, density profiles, and normalized histograms for the velocities module associated with the species were determined. The electrostatic potential field was also depicted. The model was validated for laser-ablated plasma plume and compared in good agreement with experimental molybdenum plasma jet generated by interaction of Nd:YAG nanosecond pulsed laser with solid target at atmospheric pressure.
1482	<strong>Au-Nanoparticles Strip-Loaded Channel Waveguide </strong>	A strip-loaded channel waveguide was fabricated by deposition of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) in a thin strip via organometallic chemical vapor deposition (OMCVD) on top of a polystyrene slab waveguide. The beam confinement is demonstrated experimentally, despite the absence of a classical closed layer for strip-loading. The successful AuNP density conditions for plasmonic waveguide hybrid transmission devices are discussed, typically for plasmonic sensing applications.
1483	<em></em>Ultra-fast wide band spectrum analyzer based on a rapidly tuned spin-torque nano-oscillator	A spintronic method of ultra-fast broadband microwave spectrum analysis is proposed. It uses a rapidly tuned spin torque nano-oscillator (STNO), and does not require injection locking. This method treats an STNO generating a microwave signal as an element with an oscillating resistance. When an external signal is applied to this "resistor" for analysis, it is mixed with the signal generated by the STNO. The resulting mixed voltage contains the "sum" and "difference" frequencies, and the latter produces a DC component when the external frequency matches the frequency generated by the STNO. The mixed voltage is processed using a low pass filter to exclude the "sum" frequency components, and a matched filter to exclude the dependence of the resultant DC voltage on the phase difference between the two signals. It is found analytically and by numerical simulation, that the proposed spectrum analyzer has a frequency resolution at a theoretical limit in a real-time scanning bandwidth of 10 GHz, and a frequency scanning rate above 1 GHz/ns, while remaining sensitive to signal power as low as the Johnson-Nyquist thermal noise floor.
1484	Plasmonic enhancement of figure of merit on magneto-optical Kerr effect in Au/Co/Au nanostructure	Enhancement of the longitudinal magneto-optical Kerr effect in Au/Co/Au plasmonic nanostructures was experimentally investigated. We fabricated Au/Co/Au rectangular patch arrays with different short axis lengths varied from 125 to 245 nm. When linearly polarized light with wavelength of 785 nm was illuminated to the structures, local-mode surface plasmons were resonantly excited only in the structure with 200 nm in length. Under this condition, significant enhancement of the magnitude of the complex Kerr rotation was observed. We also evaluated the figure of merit (FOM) in both Au/Co/Au and Co nanostructure and compared them. Our results demonstrated that the introduction of plasmonic Au structure to magnetic layer is effective not only to enhance the longitudinal magneto-optical Kerr rotation but also to improve the FOM parameter through the highly reflectance of Au itself.
1485	Particle size effect of Ag catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction: Activity and stability	Based on DFT calculations, we investigated the activity and stability of three octahedral Ag nanoparticles (Ag19, Ag85, and Ag146) on catalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and further compared their ORR performance to an outspread flat Ag(111) surface and Pt(111) surface. The results indicate that Ag19 cannot be used as an effective ORR catalyst mainly due to its poor stability under the electrochemical environment. In contrast, both Ag85 and Ag146 possess higher surface cohesive energies and cluster cohesive energies, indicating they have relatively lower thermodynamic tendency to electrochemical dissolution. In addition, both of these two nanoparticles also have high catalytic activities, as suggested by the calculated highest potentials of 0.80 and 0.76 eV. Therefore, our current study indicates that an octahedral Ag nanoparticle with the diameter of ~2 nm should has good catalytic activity and stability for ORR.
1486	Numerical simulation on nanosecond laser ablation oftitanium considering plasma shield andevaporation-effected surface thermocapillaryconvection	Nanosecond laser ablation of metal is a complicated process which contains many strongly coupled physic phenomena: material heating, melting, evaporation, vapor dynamic and plasma shield. Here, to investigate the nanosecond laser ablation process of titanium at 1064 nm wavelength in atmospheric air, a multi-physics axisymmetric two dimensional (2D) model is presented. The temperature evolution and distribution of titanium target was solved by governing equations and the vapor dynamic was determined by the Knudsen layer relations. Further, the plasma shield effect was calculated to correct the energy distribution of incident laser.As the laser fluence increases, the energy efficiency becomes lower. Therefore, we analyzed the surface morphology profiles after laser ablation on different laser fluence between 2 and 12 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. The result shows that the increment of laser fluence seems to lead a slower non-linear increment of the ablation depth and diameter of melt zone.  The calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental results, which provides useful information for nanosecond laser precision fabrication.
1487	Combined STM and AFM show that atomically-resolved scanning "tunneling" microscopy with contaminated tips involves large forces	Graphite is a common substrate for both scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies. It is inert and can be easily prepared. However, there are open questions regarding the interaction of tip and sample. Most notably, the giant corrugation that was observed in STM data has been postulated as an effect due to strong attractive and repulsive forces acting on the tip. We perform STM and AFM at room temperature in ultra-high vacuum to clarify the forces at play during imaging. We observed giant corrugation and, simultaneously, background repulsive forces greater than 200 nanonewtons. After tip conditioning, we were able to conduct STM in the non-contact regime and simultaneously observe short-range attractive forces.
1488	<strong>Oriented growth of metastable Co<sub>5</sub>Zr phase: Rare earth free permanent magnetic thin films<sup></sup></strong>	This letter reports the results of <em>rf</em>-magnetron sputtering grown [110] oriented 50 nm Co<sub>5</sub>Zr (CZ5) thin-films on MgO (100) single-crystal substrate. RF power, substrate temperature and film thicknesses were optimized to obtain maximum energy product for a film, calculated along the easy axis [110], as (BH)<sub>max</sub>~0.95 MGOe and H<sub>c</sub>~ 647 Oe. In light of the literature values obtained by Saito [Appl. Phys. Lett. <strong>82</strong>, 2305 (2003), Mater. Trans. <strong>44</strong>, 1713 (2003)] as BH<sub>max</sub>~1.3MGOe, with H<sub>C</sub>~2.2KOe for metastable CZ5 phase in Co<sub>80</sub>Zr<sub>20</sub> melt-spun ribbons, our results for thin film samples are significant. X ray diffraction studies along with the rocking curve analysis confirm the [110] oriented growth of the films. Evolution of hard magnetic phase (domain size ~ few tens of nanometers) at the cost of nonmagnetic matrix is clearly observed in the films grown at 600<sup>0 </sup>C in the magnetic force microscopy images taken at room temperature. Polar plots of the coercivity as a function of angle between the applied magnetic field and the film, highlight the fact that [110] oriented CZ5 film has same value of H<sub>c</sub> along set of all &lt;110&gt; directions and shows four-fold symmetry due to the cubic symmetry of the CZ5 phase.
1489	<strong>Barium-hexagonal-ferrite</strong><strong> functionalized</strong> <strong>poly(vinylidene fluoride)</strong><strong> composite film: A unique metamaterial towards enhanced microwave absorption</strong>	Barium-hexaferrite (BaH) loaded poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) composite films with different nano-filler ratio were prepared by solution casting method for electromagnetic interference shielding applications. These BaH-PVDF composite films have been evolved as the potential one for absorbing microwave radiations and the corresponding shielding effectiveness (SE) of ~ -110 dB at 8.55 GHz for one such composite film with a thickness of ~ 0.234 mm is achieved. In comparison to the other publications on ferrite/hexaferrite-polymer systems this BaH-PVDF composite films are the most effective one for the enhancement of the microwave absorption due to the following factors (i) the improvement of the b-phase of PVDF due to the incorporation of the BaH nano-fillers inside the structure of PVDF and (ii) the presence of large number of BaH-PVDF interfaces that act as the active centres during wave matter interaction. The superior control over wave matter interaction by the modulations of the above factors and thereby the enhanced microwave absorption is the aim of this work. Also, in this work the simultaneous contributions of both BaH and PVDF have been established and these all together make this particular metamaterial a unique microwave absorber.
1490	Revealing silicon crystal defects by conductive atomic force microscope	The machining and polishing can result in damages on silicon surface. It is of paramount importance to investigate electric performance of processed surface for understanding and improving the employment of silicon components with nanoscale crystal defects. In this study, the conductivity of nanoscratches on silicon surface was investigated using a conductive atomic force microscope. Compared to the original silicon surface, electric breakover can be detected on mechanically scratched area at low bias voltage, and the current increases with the voltage. In contrast, no obvious current was found on defect-free scratch created by tribochemical removal. The conductivity can also be found on a friction-induced protrusive hillock created at high speed, nor on a hillock created at low speed that is constructed by amorphous silicon. Further analysis shows that lattice distortions can facilitate easily electron flow and contribute greatly to the conductivity of a mechanical scratch on silicon, but amorphous layer contributes hardly to the conductivity, which is supported by high resolution transmission electron microscope. As a result, the relation between the electrical performance and microstructures was experimentally established. These findings shed new light on subtle mechanism of defect-dependent conductivity, and also provides a rapid and nondestructive method for detecting surface defects.
1491	Two-Dimensional Monolayer FETs with PN Junction or Heterojunction Channels	The major challenges in the scaling of metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) include large source-to-drain leakage and small on/off current ratio, especially when the channel length is below 10nm. To address these challenges, we designed and investigated a new type of short-channel FETs based on two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with a PN junction or heterojunction at the middle of the channel. In this comprehensive first-principle computational study, different gate length and channel materials have been investigated and compared, with a focus on the analysis of ballistic transport and energy band alignment. The results indicate that the off-state leakage current and on/off current ratio are significantly improved in the FETs with a junction channel, in comparison with the FETs with homogeneous channel. This new junction-channel approach, leveraged with the intrinsic advantages offered by 2D TMDC monolayers, suggests a new and very attractive strategy to construct future nanoelectronic transistors.
1492	Response Increase of Antenna-Coupled Nanothermocouples by Thermal Insulation	We present a 2.5-fold increase in the open-circuit voltage response of antenna-coupled nanothermocouples (ACNTCs) by thermally insulating them from the SiO2/Si substrate using an oxide membrane suspended over a cavity formed from the Si substrate. Polarization-dependent measurements are presented and compared to simulation results. The thermal response of the ACNTCs increases 2.5-fold when they are thermally insulated from the substrate by the cavity. We also show that the polarization-dependent response, and hence the polarization ratio, depends on the depth of the cavity.
1493	Purcell enhancement of the photon parametric decay in two-dimensional nonlinear materials	Ultracompact nonlinear optical devices utilizing two-dimensional (2D) materials and nanostructures are emerging as important elements of photonic circuits. Integration of the nonlinear material into a subwavelength cavity or waveguide leads to a strong Purcell enhancement of the nonlinear processes and compensates for a small interaction volume. The generic feature of such devices which makes them especially challenging for analysis is strong dissipation of both the nonlinear polarization and highly confined modes of a subwavelength cavity. Here we solve a  quantum-electrodynamic problem of the spontaneous and stimulated parametric decay in a nonlinear quasi-2D waveguide or cavity. We develop a rigorous Heisenberg-Langevin approach which includes dissipation and fluctuations in the electron ensemble and in the electromagnetic field of a cavity on equal footing. Within a relatively simple model, we take into account the nonlinear coupling of the quantized cavity modes, their interaction with a dissipative reservoir and the outside world, amplification of thermal noise and zero-point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field, and other relevant effects. We derive closed-form analytic results for relevant quantities such as the spontaneous parametric signal power and the threshold for parametric instability. We find a strong reduction in the parametric instability threshold for 2D nonlinear materials in a subwavelength cavity and provide a comparison with conventional nonlinear photonic devices.
1494	Electrical and optical characterization of extended SWIR detectors based on thin films of nano-columnar PbSe	There is an increasing demand for detectors with extended Short Wavelength Infrared (SWIR) absorption at wavelengths between 1.6mm and 2.8mm.  Towards that end, PbSe absorber layers were grown by the Chemical-Bath-Deposition (CBD) technique in a columnar morphology on n-type (100) oriented GaAs substrate, where the columns are densely packed perpendicular to the substrate. The spectral absorption edge and photoluminescence (PL) peak of these layers were blue shifted from the bulk bandgap of 4.7mm to 2.2mm, i.e., within the extended SWIR range, due to quantum confinement effect.  Current voltage (I-V) measurements were carried out in a vertical geometry of different circular mesa sizes (250-2000&mu;m in diameter). The area dependent current&ndash;voltage measurements indicate a densely packed layer with no apparent pinholes. On the other hand, surface leakage currents on the mesa perimeters are the dominant mechanism of the dark current. A photo-response to SWIR illumination was evident, confirming the feasibility of using such structures as extended SWIR photodetectors upon minimizing leakage currents using surface treatments
1495	<strong>Resistivity switching in activated carbon fibers</strong>	This work presents an effect of switching of resistivity of activated carbon fibers, obtained with a combination of adsorption of specific molecules and application of external electric field. Observed jumps of resistivity were due to the ordering of dipolar guest molecules which acted as a gating factor for hopping transport of charge carriers within the granular fiber structure. The presented research shows that the control of electrical transport in porous carbon systems is possible by means of structure, host-guest interactions, temperature and external stimulation. As such it is important for fundamental understanding of electronic properties of graphene-based systems, as well as for their adsorption-related applications, for example energy generation and storage. Resistivity switching might prove useful for tuning of the carrier transport in nanoelectronic units (single electron transistors, spin valves) or for increasing the sensitivity and selectivity of molecular sensors.
1496	Ni(OH)2 Nanoplates Decorated on Graphene Nanosheets for Alkaline Secondary Batteries	The &#x03B2;-nickel hydroxide/reduced graphene oxide (&#x03B2;-Ni(OH)2/RGO) nanocomposites were successfully synthesized by microwave-assisted method. The as-obtianed samples are composed of the &#x03B2;-Ni(OH)2 nanoplates deposited homogeneously on the surfaces of RGO layer. The discharge capacity of &#x03B2;-Ni(OH)2/RGO composite fell from 316.3 to 259.9 mAh/g at the discharge rate from 0.2 to 10 C, the capacity decrease slightly by 17.8%. The excellent capacity and rate capability are assigned to the well-defined nanocrystallinity of the disorder hexagnoal &#x03B2;-Ni(OH)2 nanoplates growing and anchoring on the surface of the RGO layer with most numerous of available active sites, which provide more comfort space  for protons and ions. By virtue of the superior capacity of pseudocapacitive &#x03B2;-Ni(OH)2 and pleasurable conductivity of RGO make the &#x03B2;-Ni(OH)2/RGO) composites a promising battery-type material for high-performance alkaline rechargeable batteries.
1497	Influence of the Dzyaloshinskii&ndash;Moriya Interaction on the topological Hall effect in crossed nanowires	We used micromagnetic simulations to investigate the influence of the Dzyaloshinskii&ndash;Moriya interaction (DMI) on the topological Hall effect (THE) in crossed nanowires with two characteristic magnetic structures, including radiated-shape and antivortex states. Early in our study, we found that the occurrence of the THE strongly depends on the polarity and vorticity, and topological Hall resistivities separate into four values in an external magnetic field, depending on the polarity and vorticity. In this report, we show that even in the absence of an external magnetic field the topological Hall resistivities also separate into four values in crossed nanowires under the influence of the DMI. Therefore, by measuring the THE, we can detect both the polarity and the vorticity simultaneously, even in the absence of a magnetic field. This result might be useful as a basic technique for studying and developing next-generation multi-value memory.
1498	Impact of Pulmonary Alveolar Epithelial Cells of Human Lung on Microfluidic Chips	The investigation of the human physiology and pathophysiology requires models that resemble living tissues and organs as precisely as possible. Animal models and static cell cultures lack human tissue-specific (or organ-specific) functions, which are available in dynamic cell cultures using microfluidic systems. Air pollution is a serious problem currently affecting society, and it primarily has adverse effects on the lung. Pollutants are found in particulate matter, including silica, which is a component of sand dust. Here, we demonstrate the differences in static and dynamic cell culture responses and the effect of air pollution on the lung. Human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells were cultured in a silica-nanoparticle-treated medium on plates and single-channel microfluidic chips. The dynamic cell culture gave more plausible qualitative and quantitative cell viability staining results than the static cell culture. We successfully managed to achieve a healthy cell culture of human lung cells in a microfluidic chip. The analysis methods revealed various kinds of differences between the static and dynamic cell cultures; these differences are crucial for designing a model that represents a human in vivo environment as closely as possible.
1499	Density and viscosity profiles governing nanochannel flow	The density and viscosity profiles across the nanochannel height were respectively compared between the flow factor approach model and molecular dynamics simulation for the Poiseuille flow in a nanochannel, when the agreements between these two approaches were good in calculating both the flow velocity profile across the channel height and the volume flow rate through the channel. It was found that except close to the confining wall, the comparisons in the two regards showed satisfactory agreements; Because of the solidification of the thin layer close to the wall, the errors of the flow factor approach model in calculating both the local density and local viscosity close to the wall can not considerably affect its calculation accuracy of both the flow velocity profile across the channel height and the volume flow rate through the channel, both of which were actually governed by the density and viscosity profiles of the flowing media in the middle section of the channel height.
1500	<strong>Effect of inhomogeneous mesoporosity and defects on the luminescent properties of slanted silicon nanowires prepared by facile metal-assisted chemical etching</strong>	Slanted silicon nanowires show an improved optical absorption and better electrical contact than the vertical silicon nanowires. High aspect ratio mesoporous slanted silicon nanowires oriented along &lt;100&gt; direction are fabricated by a facile two-step metal-assisted chemical etching process. Inhomogeneous porosity with pore diameter of 2-10 nm is identified by the analysis of transmission electron microscopy, angle dependent Raman spectroscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller measurements. Slanted silicon nanowires possess a core/shell structure and the porosity varies from top to bottom of the slanted silicon nanowires. The presence of neutral oxygen defects, self-trapped excitons and surface defects is identified by photoluminescence spectroscopy, and the results are correlated with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data. In addition to mesoporosity, defects such as self-trapped excitons, oxygen vacancies and surface defects on Si/SiO<sub>x</sub> interface contribute to the luminescence of slanted silicon nanowires. Red shift in the photoluminescence with increasing etching time is explained using Quantum Confinement Luminescent Center model. Understanding the role of defects and porosity in slanted silicon nanowires is highly desirable to increase the efficiency of silicon nanowires based optoelectronic devices.
1501	Ultrafine ErC<sub>2</sub>@C Core-Shell Structural Nanocomposite with Significant Magnetocaloric Effect and Microwave Absorption Properties	<strong>Traditional techniques for synthesizing ultrafine rare carbide particles involving high-temperature annealing processes are lack of effectiveness, resulting in an extreme limitation to fully explore their properties and potential applications. We herein demonstrate a modified arc-discharging approach to synthesize the core/shell structural ErC<sub>2</sub>@C nanoparticles, in which ultrafine ErC<sub>2</sub> clusters with a mean diameter of 7.5&plusmn;0.5 nm can be uniformly dispersed in carbon matrix ascribed to the non-equilibrium evaporation-condensation process. It is found that the ErC<sub>2</sub>@C nanoparticles present significant magnetocaloric and microwave absorption performances, corresponding to the magnetic entropy change of 8.7 J/kg K at 4 K with the magnetic field variation of 0-5 T, and the maximum reflection loss of -49 dB at 15 GHz for a 2.44 mm thick absorber. The present work thus provides an effective strategy for the synthesis of rare earth carbides and explores their potential applications in diverse fields.</strong>
1502	A novel method to increase the productivity of nanoparticles by double wire electrical explosion	Low production efficiency is the key factor that restricting the application of the electrical exploding wire technology used in metal nanoparticles preparation field. This paper presents a novel and simple double wire electrical explosion (WEE) method to increase the nanoparticles productivity. The overvoltage generated by the first WEE process is used to breakdown the designed transfer spark gap and induced the second WEE process, leading to a double electrical explosion process in one circle of the capacitor discharge. The principle of the double electrical explosion process is expounded and parameters are optimized by experiments. The effects of the second metal wire length on the value of the deposited energy in metal wire were analyzed and optimized according to the coefficient of the metal wire overheating. The results showed that the optimal proportion of the first and the second metal wires was 1: 0.836, and the production efficiency can increase by 83.6 percent, which was significant for the metal nanoparticles large-scale preparation science the metal wire electrical explosion process operated in repetition mode.
1503	Be3N2 monolayer: a graphene-like two-dimensional material and its derivative nanoribbons	Using first-principles calculations, we computationally designed a new two-dimensional (2D) inorganic material, Be3N2 monolayer with a flat hexagonal structure similar to graphene . Good stability of the Be3N2 monolayer is demonstrated by its moderate cohesive energy, the absence of imaginary modes in its phonon spectrum, and the high melting point predicted by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.The Be3N2 monolayer is a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 3.831 eV that can be effectively tuned by employing an external strain.The wide band gap and outstanding strain-engineered properties make Be3N2 monolayer a highly versatile and promising 2D material for innovative applications in microelectromechanical and nanoelectronic devices. Additionally, the one-dimensional Be3N2 nanoribbons which divided by Be3N2 monolayer, are computed to have quite rich characteristics such as direct band gaps with various values, depending on the direction of the division and the width of nanoribbons.
1504	<strong>Ultrafast Plasmon Charge Transfer Dynamics in Au-ZnO Nanocomposite Thin Films</strong>	Here, we present ultrafast charge transfer dynamics in Au-ZnO nanocomposite systems by exciting them in inter- and intra -band levels of Au with pump energies higher (2.48 eV) and lower (1.96 eV) than the threshold energy for inter-band transition (2.4 eV), using femtosecond time-resolved pump-probe technique. The spectral responses for both the excitations exhibit different behaviors and these variations are quantitatively interpreted in terms of pump induced changes in the dielectric constant of Au. It is found from the temporal dynamics that the electron-phonon component in Au-ZnO system decays much faster (~3 ps in multilayer Au-ZnO for 2.48 eV excitation) than that observed in Au sample (~7 ps in Au) for both the pump energies. The transfer of highly energetic electrons from Au nanoparticles to ZnO across the Schottky barrier results in an accessible optical response for wide band gap ZnO in the visible to infrared range via plasmon charge collection. The calculated charge transfer rate in Au-ZnO system is found to be (&gt;10<sup>11</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). Our work demonstrates a study to understand the ultrafast charge transfer processes in metal-semiconductor hybrid structures for various photonic devices.
1505	Dielectric properties of condensed systems composed of fragments	The dielectric properties of molecules or nanostructures are usually modified in a complex manner, when assembled into a condensed phase. We propose a first-principles method to compute polarizabilities of sub-entities of solids and liquids, which accounts for multipolar interactions at all orders, and is applicable to any semiconductor or insulator.  The method only requires the evaluation of induced fields in the condensed phase, with no need of multiple calculations for each constituent. As an example, we present results for the molecular polarizabilities of liquid water in a wide pressure and temperature range. We found that at ambient conditions, the dipole-induced-dipole approximation is sufficiently accurate and the Clausius-Mossotti relation may be used, e.g. to obtain molecular polarizabilities from experimental refractive indexes. However with increasing pressure this approximation becomes unreliable and in the case of ice X the Clausius-Mossotti relation is not valid.
1506	Metastable &#xF064;-Fe during reduction of Ferric Oxide and its magnetic properties	Ferric oxide (Fe2O3) was reduced to metallic Fe using the carbon source from the nut shells of pistachio or walnuts at temperatures above 1400 &#x00BA;C in argon gas atmospheres.  X-ray diffraction analysis shows the presence of &#xF061;-, &#xF067;-, and &#xF064;- phases of Fe in addition to the presence of graphite phases as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and amorphous carbon.  By selecting the appropriate ratios of each nut shell powder to Fe2O3, it is demonstrated that pure Fe is produced without any residual ferric oxide.  The amount of each of the three Fe phases was dependent on the temperature and the duration of processing at high temperature. Transmission electron microcopy results showed copious quantities of CNTs.  Magnetic data suggested the average magnetic moment was consistent with &#xF061;-Fe but reduced moment for both the &#xF067;-Fe and &#xF064;-Fe. This simple method of producing &#xF064;-Fe along with CNTs has potential industrial applications as composites.
1507	Thermoelectric efficiency in three-terminal Graphene nano-junctions	The thermoelectric efficiency of a thermal machine consisting of a triangular graphene nano-junctions connected to three electrodes in the linear response regime is studied. Using the Onsager formalism and a combination of semi-empirical tight-binding calculations as well as Green's function theory, the efficiency at maximum output power which can be written in terms of generalized figures of merit is investigated. Results for a set of temperature and  chemical potential parameters shown that adding a third terminal will improve the efficiency at maximum output power with respect to the two-terminal setup.
1508	Dual-band Dielectric Light-harvesting Nanoantennae Made by Nature	We show that the dual-band maxima in the absorption spectrum of bacterial light harvestors not only are due to the bacteriochlorophylls involved but also come from the geometry of the light harvestor.sBeing able to manipulate these two band arbitrarily enable us to fabricate the nanoparticles to separate sunlight into photovotalic useful range and thermally useful range to increase the efficiency of solar light harvesting. Such antennae are also useful for remote power charging at flexible configuration.
1509	<strong>Half-metallic surfaces in thin-film Ti<sub>2</sub>MnAl<sub>0.5</sub>Sn<sub>0.5</sub></strong>	Materials exhibiting a high degree of spin polarization in electron transport are in demand for applications in spintronics &ndash; an emerging technology utilizing a spin degree of freedom in electronic devices. Room-temperature half-metals are considered ideal candidates, as they behave as an insulator for one spin channel and as a conductor for the other spin channel. In addition, for nano-size devices, one has to take into account possible modification of electronic structure in thin-film geometry, due to the potential presence of surface/interface states. It has been shown that typically these states have a detrimental impact on half-metallicity. Here, we employ density functional calculations to explore an inverse Heusler compound, Ti<sub>2</sub>MnAl<sub>0.5</sub>Sn<sub>0.5</sub>, which exhibits half-metallic electronic structure in bulk. In particular, this material behaves as a regular metal for majority-spin, and as a semiconductor for minority-spin states. We show that in thin-film geometry, the type of termination surface has a decisive effect on half-metallicity of this material. In particular, we analyze six possible termination configurations, and show that for four of them, energy states emerge in the minority-spin band gap, reducing the spin polarization of Ti<sub>2</sub>MnAl<sub>0.5</sub>Sn<sub>0.5</sub>. At the same time, our calculations indicate that two termination surfaces <em>preserve</em> half-metallic properties of this material. This result is somewhat unexpected, as most of the available literature reports reduction of the spin-polarization due to the presence of surface states. Thus, our results show that a judicious choice of the termination surface may be a crucial factor in nano-device applications, where highly spin-polarized current is needed.
1510	Occupied Free-Space Superatom States in an Encapsulated Ca2N Nanotube	Inspired by the success of the periodic law of elements, superatom states have been widely used to understand complex chemical systems. Besides those states delocalized on multiple atoms, the concept of superatom states has also been extended to states distributed in free space surround or confined by multiple atoms. Such free-space superatom states are expected to provide a useful conceptual framework to understand chemical properties of their associated nanosystems. Unfortunately, all free-space superatom states reported to date are unoccupied states, which strongly limits their applications. In this study, we predict that both occupied and unoccupied free-space superatom states exist in an encapsulated Ca2N nanotube. In this composite system, the inner Ca2N nanotube provides anionic electrons in free space inside the tube which form occupied s-, p-, and d-like superatom states. The outer carbon nanotube layer provides a protection for these free-space superatom states from ambient environment. Such protected superatom states are expected to have a great potential in various application fields such as catalysis and electronics.
1511	<strong>Tailoring nanostructured surfaces with plasmonic/magnetic </strong><strong>multifunctional response</strong>	In this work we present an innovative way to functionalize large surfaces combining both plasmonic and ferromagnetic nanoparticles on a substrate, by growth of bilayers and a subsequent single annealing. In particular, we show here the formation of Au and &gamma;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles using this route. Thermal treatments promote the nanostructuration of the film plus a partial oxidation of Fe to form ferrimagnetic oxides. For this purpose, annealing conditions and the structure of the bilayer must be selected to achieve an optimal nanostructuration, avoiding the full oxidation of Fe to form antiferromagnetic hematite.
1512	Hollow-cathode glow discharge in a trigger unit of pseudospark switch	This paper deals with the investigation of the sealed-off hold-cathode thyratron (pseudospark switch) with a trigger unit that uses a low-current auxiliary glow discharge. As distinct from the commercially produced thyratron TPI1-10k/50, the trigger system of the device under investigation is modernized so that it is able to operate in absence of the so-called high-emissivity tablet. The data on the principal features of the discharge sustainment in the novel trigger system are obtained. The interpretation of the data is carried out based on the model of the discharge with hollow cathode, which has been developed as applied to the conditions of the low current densities. It is shown that the regimes of the auxiliary discharge have an impact on the trigger characteristics of the switch. The ability of the switch operation with nanosecond stability with respect to a trigger pulse at high anode voltages is demonstrated.
1513	Single-shot near edge X-ray fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy using a laboratory laser-plasma light source	We present a proof of principle experiment on single-shot near edge soft X-ray fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy with the use of a laboratory laser-plasma light source. The source is based on a plasma created as a result of the interaction of a nanosecond laser pulse with a double stream gas puff target. The laser-plasma source was optimized for efficient soft X-ray (SXR) emission from the krypton/helium target in the wavelength range from 2 nm to 5 nm. This emission was used to acquire simultaneously emission and absorption spectra of soft X-ray light from the source and from the investigated sample using a grazing incidence grating spectrometer. NEXAFS measurements in a transmission mode revealed the spectral features near the carbon K-&#x03B1; absorption edge of thin PET film and L-ascorbic acid in a single-shot. From these features, the composition of the PET sample was successfully obtained. The NEXAFS spectrum of the L-ascorbic acid obtained in a single-shot exposure was also compared to the spectrum obtained a multi-shot exposure and to numerical simulations showing good agreement. In the paper, the detailed information about the source, the spectroscopy system,  the absorption spectra measurements and the results of the studies are presented and discussed.
1514	Ultrafast dynamics of hexaferrite colloidal particles	Here we report an experimental study on the rotational dynamics of hard magnetic hexaferrite nanoparticles in water. Stable aqueous colloid of SrFe<sub>12</sub>O<sub>19</sub> was synthesized by borate glass-ceramic dissolution technique and studied by TEM, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), magnetometry and optical transmission methods in applied DC and AC magnetic fields. The particles represent nanoplates with a mean diameter of 50 nm and a mean thickness of 5 nm having a coercive force of 4700 Oe and a saturation magnetization of 51.5 emu/g. According to magnetic field dependent SAXS data, a probability orientation function was suggested considering the colloidal particles rotation in the applied field as an activation-free process. The magnetization dynamics of the colloidal rotators was described by an interplay of magnetic torque and drag force in the frame of non-interacting particles model. At frequencies below 100 Hz, the particles are able to fully rotate after the magnetic field. At higher frequencies, the complete following becomes impossible due to the energy dissipation and the particles movement changes to oscillations around randomly oriented axes. These vibrational axes can be aligned by strong external permanent magnetic field, causing the coherent particles oscillations and correspondingly the rise of the high-frequency response of the colloid optical transmission. As a result, the efficient magneto-optical light modulation has been achieved at frequencies exceeding 5 kHz, revealing the fastest response rates among known colloidal magneto-optical media.
1515	<strong>High Curie Temperature CoSi nanowires by Mn-doping.</strong>	We report the synthesis of high Curie temperature (Tc &gt;800K) Mn-doped CoSi nanowires. CoSi and Co<sub>1-x</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>Si nanowires were synthesized by Chemical Vapor Deposition. Transmission electron microscopy was used to identify a crystalline B20 cubical structure. Zero-field cooling and field cooling measurements confirm a spin disorder behaviour at low temperatures. The magnetic properties of doped samples were explained by means of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction where the localized Mn atoms interact with the conduction electrons in CoSi providing a net ferromagnetic moment and explaining spin disorder at low temperatures. An individual CoSi nanowire was experimentally analysed by performing off-axis electron holography, providing information about its local magnetization. DFT calculations were performed to understand the effects of Mn doping, Si-vacancies and surface atoms in the magnetic properties at the surface of the nanowire. An estimation of the Curie temperature was made using the mean field approximation (MFA).
1516	Nanoscale transitions in glass-forming melts	Glass-forming melts frequently undergo a liquid-liquid transition (LLT). Unraveling the nature of LLTs is therefore seen as an important stage in identifying valid theories of the glass transition itself. In this work, we find evidence for two LLTs being no true phase transitions in the thermodynamic sense but nanoscale transformations. We base this conclusion on simulations of two distinct, albeit generic glass formers: the ternary alloy Zr<sub>0.606</sub>Cu<sub>0.29</sub>Al<sub>0.104</sub> and silica (SiO<sub>_2</sub>): although various thermodynamic, structural, and dynamical properties or their temperature derivatives appear to change quasi-discontinuously at the LLT, no computed quantity shows any size-dependence reminiscent of a thermodynamic phase transition once the system size exceeds a few hundred atoms.
1517	Determination of the Quantum Well Carrier Capture Time by Transport Factors in Light Emitting Transistor	We carry out the physical modeling of the light emitting transistor (LET) operation with the focus on the carrier lifetime in the base, which is a key factor in the device speed performances. Our model is based on the observation of the degradation of the base transport factor caused by the LET heavy base doping, and its variation with the base current. We revise the conventional charge control model of the bipolar junction transistor (BJT) to account for these new features and assess the concentration of the base minority carriers captured in the quantum well (QW). Our approach based on the Zhang and Leburton&rsquo;s (Z-L) rate equation model enables us to obtain the device microscopic parameters, such as the capture time, base recombination lifetime and base transit time in terms of the LET emitter current and base current, as well as the design parameters such as doping concentration, base width, QW width or QW location.  Whereas the base recombination lifetime can be estimated to be of the order of a fraction of a nanosecond, the QW capture time is found to be of the order of a picosecond or less. Our simulation successfully reproduces the optical frequency response diagram of the LET obtained from the experiment.
1518	Growth and mechanical properties of 111-oriented V0.5Mo0.5Nx/Al2O3(0001) thin films	Pseudobinary V0.5Mo0.5Nx(111) alloys with the B1-NaCl crystal structure are grown on Al2O3(0001) substrates in an ultra-high-vacuum system by reactive magnetron sputter deposition in mixed Ar/N2 atmospheres at temperatures Ts between 100 and 900 {degree sign}C. Nitrogen-to-metal, N/(V+Mo), fractions x vary monotonically from 0.9{plus minus}0.1 with Ts = 100 {degree sign}C to 0.4{plus minus}0.1 at Ts = 900 {degree sign}C. Nitrogen loss at higher growth temperatures leads to a corresponding decrease in the relaxed lattice parameter ao from 4.21{plus minus}0.01 &#x00C5; at Ts = 300 {degree sign}C to 4.125{plus minus}0.005 &#x00C5; with Ts = 900 {degree sign}C. Scanning electron micrographs of cube-corner nanoindents extending into the substrate show that the films are relatively ductile, exhibiting material pile-up (plastic flow) around the indent edges. Nanoindentation hardnesses H and elastic moduli E, obtained using a calibrated Berkovich tip, of V0.5Mo0.5Nx(111) layers increase with increasing Ts (decreasing x) from 15{plus minus}1 and 198{plus minus}5 GPa at 100 {degree sign}C to 23{plus minus}2 and 381{plus minus}11 GPa at 900 {degree sign}C. These values are lower than corresponding results obtained for 001-oriented V0.5Mo0.5Nx films. In addition, film wear resistance increases with increasing Ts, while the coefficient of friction, under 1000 &#x00B5;N loads, is 0.09{plus minus}0.01 for all layers.
1519	<strong>Surprisingly high magneto-electric coupling in cubic Co<sub>0.7</sub>Fe<sub>2.3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-SrTiO<sub>3</sub> nano-composites</strong>	Magnetoelectric (ME) coupling of (x)SrTiO<sub>3</sub>-(1-x)Co<sub>0.7</sub>Fe<sub>2.3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> synthesized by the sol-gel method is presented in this study. The presence of constituent phases of Co<sub>0.7</sub>Fe<sub>2.3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>  (CFO) and SrTiO<sub>3</sub>(STO) in the composites were confirmed by x-ray diffraction studies. The field emission scanning electron micrographs show well-distributed CFO and STO phases in the composites. The dielectric constant (e&cent;) and loss tangent (tand) of the composites were studied as a function of frequency. CFO and all the composites exhibit typical ferromagnetic hysteresis loops whereas their ferroelectric hysteresis loops show leaky behavior. Surprisingly high value of magnetoelectric voltage coefficient, a<sub>ME</sub> = 9.1 mV/cm Oe is obtained for the composite having 50% STO and 50% CFO content. These results demonstrate that the lead free STO-CFO could be effective as magnetoelectric composite and may provide an alternative for environmental friendly ME device application.
1520	<strong>Refined model for plasmon ruler based on catenary shaped optical fields</strong><sup></sup>	The catenary, in addition to be structure of mechanics and optics, expresses the rule of evanescent field coupling between metallic nanoparticle pairs. In the present paper, the catenary shaped optical field distributions within the gap of nanoparticle pairs as well as the distance dependence of scattering spectrum shift are investigated. A novel model defined by power attenuation functions is established to describe the scaling behavior of local field enhancement and plasmon wavelength shift of metallic nanoparticle pairs. Compared to traditional model, the proposed model here can more accurately describe the scaling behavior of scattering spectrum shift, which help to refine the existing plasmon rulers. Our findings can serve as a guideline for designing and optimizing catenary field based plasmon rulers.
1521	<strong>Nanoindentation and bending fracture behavior of flexible inorganic thin films grown at near room temperature with <em>in situ</em> tensile/compressive stress </strong>	Residual stress is known to affect significantly the mechanical fracture behavior of flexible thin films. Here we suggest an <em>in situ </em>chemical deposition process that allows for control of extra compressive or tensile stress in inorganic thin films. This process uses the fixed convex or concave surface of a flexible substrate to impart compressive or tensile stress, respectively, after the releasing step to the flat mode. Using two technical evaluations of mechanical fracture behavior, the existence of extra stress was verified with expected enhancements of the fracture resistance only in the case of compressive stress. For example, a ~45% improvement of the elastic modulus was confirmed by nanoindentation testing for a compressively stressed sample compared to the reference sample. The bending fracture resistance was also enhanced for the compressively stressed sample, as evidenced by a ~18.5% improvement in the crack-initiating critical strain under the bending motion.
1522	Electronic transport induced by edge modification of graphene electrodes in single molecular device	The electronic transport properties of salicylidene aniline based molecular devices with the graphene electrodes are investigated using the density functional theory and the non-equilibrium Green&rsquo;s functions. The calculated results suggest a clear switching behavior. In addtion, the modification of -OH on the edge of graphene nanoribbons causes the increase of currents, but the reduction of switching ratio. The modification of F on the edge of graphene nanoribbons improves the switching ratio. Also the negative differential resistance effect found in the device is discussed by the transmission spectra and local density of states. The results show the effects of different modifications of the edge of graphene nanoribbons on the electron transport. This method can become a candidate to improve the performance of device in future molecular circuits.
1523	Conductance recovery in graphene nano-ribbons systems using pseudo-spin filters	In this work we study some applications for the pseudo-spin filters. The filters are potential barriers with hyperboloid sub-band contributions that are locally applied over the graphene nano-ribbons. These filters modulate the pseudo-spin and the quirality of the wave-function allowing the recovery of the conductance loss due to imperfection, bends, or constrictions found in the system. The filters can be used as patches for damaged regions within the ribbon in order to increase the transmission, even when it is zero. The recovery of the conductance is fulfilled by a direct manipulation of the pseudo-spin polarization at both sides of the scattering region, which allows the recovery of the wave-function symmetry between the entrance and the exit of the <br />system.
1524	X-ray Ptychography on low dimensional hard condensed matter materials	Understanding the structure of low-dimensional hard-condensed matter systems is critical for manipulation and optimization of next-generation nano-scale semiconductor and spintronic devices. Synchrotron X-ray based imaging techniques, have been under intensive development in the last two decades.  They are complementary to traditional electron-based imaging methods while adding advantages of elemental and bulk sensitivities. X-ray ptychography is a reciprocal-space based imaging technique, with strong phase-contrast with potentially diffraction-limited spatial resolution. Further, using resonant X-ray, the technique can be made to be element, electronic and magnetic sensitive. In this review article, the far-field diffraction-based ptychography techniques are discussed, and examples of their scientific importance in low dimensional materials sciences are presented. Near field or Fourier ptychography will not be discussed in this review. Future developments in this emerging field are proposed for nanotechnology and materials sciences in general.
1525	Femtosecond time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy for imaging the spatially heterogeneous carrier relaxation dynamics of semiconductors	Femtosecond time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy (TR-PEEM) simultaneously furnishes high spatial- and temporal resolution and is therefore well suited to the study of ultrafast phenomena of spatially heterogeneous materials. Until recently, however, the majority of the TR-PEEM investigations to date are confined to plasmonic phenomena in metal nanostructures. Here, we report a TR-PEEM instrument based on interfacing the hollow-core fiber-compressed output from a fiber laser to a PEEM microscope. The instrument is used to generate lifetime maps that report on the spatially heterogeneous carrier relaxation dynamics of semiconductor materials. Starting from a Yb fiber laser with 1030-nm center wavelength (1.20-eV photon energy), 50-&#x00B5;J pulse energy, and 320-fs pulse duration, 55-fs pulses are produced after spectral broadening in xenon gas followed by dispersion compensation by chirped mirrors and a pair of fused silica wedges. The harmonics 2&#xF077; - 5&#xF077; are produced by second harmonic generation and/or sum-frequency generation in BBO crystals, yielding pulse widths of 46 fs, 40 fs and 28 fs for the 2&#x03C9; (2.41 eV), 3&#x03C9; (3.61 eV), and 4&#x03C9; (4.81 eV) pulses, respectively. Given the high, 0.6-MHz repetition rate of the fiber laser, an exposure time of 10 s yields static PEEM images with spatial resolutions of 77 nm and 58 nm when the sample is illuminated by 3&#x03C9; and 4&#x03C9; light, respectively. Finally, we show that the apparatus can be used to investigate the sub-100-fs electronic relaxation dynamics of single-layer platinum diselenide (PtSe2) at the &#x0393; valley following photoexcitation with 2.41-eV light. By using a home-built MATLAB code, we produce an image of the spatial distribution of electronic relaxation time constants, whose statistical analysis not only recovers the ensemble-averaged electronic relaxation time constant, but also directly yields the extent of spatial heterogeneity of the observed dynamics.
1526	<strong>Controlling the charge transport mode in permalloy films using oblique angle deposition </strong>	We have systematically studied the effect of oblique angle deposition on the transport properties of permalloy thin films. Films deposited at angles larger than 50<sup>0</sup> exhibit a metal-insulator transition that can be further manipulated by changing the deposition angle. This transition is manifested as a deviation from the usual phonon-scattering behavior in the temperature dependence of the resistivity. Furthermore, a change in the magnetic anisotropy in the films is clearly demonstrated in their magnetoresistance that shifts from negative to positive with increasing deposition angle. Oblique angle deposition results in the formation of nano-pillars that modify the fundamental electron scattering process in the films. The modifications in the scattering process produce a metal-insulator transition in the films grown at high angels. The possible mechanisms responsible for the observed behavior are discussed.
1527	<strong>Mechanical Properties of Tungsten-Rhenium, Lanthanum and Copper doped Tungsten-Rhenium nanostructures &ndash; a DFT study</strong>	The mechanical properties of Tungsten(W), Re doped W (W-Re), La doped W-Re and Cu doped W-Re nanostructures were explored using density functional theory (DFT). For exploring the mechanical properties, elastic constants, Young&rsquo;s modulus, Bulk modulus and Shear modulus were observed. The ductility and hardness of the nanostructures have also been studied at the atomistic level. Furthermore, the density of states spectrum (DOS) was analyzed for these nanostructures. The findings reveal that W<sub>0.81</sub>Re<sub>0.14</sub>Cu<sub>0.05 </sub>nanostructures show the best combination when compared to factors like ductility and Young&rsquo;s modulus.
1528	Simple and Facile One Pot Hydrothermal Synthesis for Nanopetallike Thermochromic VO<sub>2</sub>	This paper reports successful synthesis of different phase of nanopetallike thermochromic VO<sub>2 </sub>via hydrothermal method by varying molar ratio of reducing agent, citric acid monohydrate to vanadium source, vanadium (V) oxide and by keeping temperature 230<sup>o</sup>C for 24hr. Five samples are synthesized with molar ratio V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> to citric acid monohydrate 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4. The synthesized nanoparticles are characterized by XRD for phase identification, FTIR for confirmation of chemical composition. To confirm about optical properties, UV VIS is done. Electrical conductivity is also confirmed with conductivity meter. Morphology and uniform size distribution of the materials is found with SEM and size of the particles is confirmed with TEM. Thermal properties are confirmed with STA. Synthesized materials VO<sub>2 </sub>(B) and VO<sub>2</sub> (M) are useful for electrochemical and energy saving window coating if its transition temperature is controlled.
1529	Study on large-area silicon nanopillars with broadband low reflectance	Broadband low-reflectance silicon has a variety of potential applications and low-cost, large-scale preparation is beneficial to industrial applications. In this work, we fabricate and investigate large-area silicon nanostructures with low reflectance in a wide wavelength range by using a low-cost metal assisted chemical etching method. It is found that the silicon nanostructure consists of vertical nanopillars in a random distribution and the pillar heights are lower than 3 um. The weighted average reflectivity shows low reflectivity of 2.3% in a wide wavelength range of 300 to 1100 nm. The model is constructed and the reflectivity simulations are conducted by using the finite-difference time-domain method. The simulation result shows a good consistency with the measurement result in the wavelength range of 300 to 1030 nm. The present results can be used to investigate and understand large-area silicon nanostructures with broadband low reflectivity.
1530	High Curie Temperature CoSi nanowires by Mn-doping	We report the synthesis of high Curie temperature (T<sub>C</sub> &gt;800K) Mn-doped CoSi nanowires. CoSi and Co<sub>1-x</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>Si nanowires were synthesized by Chemical Vapor Deposition. Transmission electron microscopy was used to identify a crystalline B20 cubical structure. Zero-field cooling and field cooling measurements confirm a spin disorder behaviour at low temperatures. The magnetic properties of doped samples were explained by means of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction where the localized Mn atoms interact with the conduction electrons in CoSi providing a net ferromagnetic moment and explaining spin disorder at low temperatures. An individual CoSi nanowire was experimentally analysed by performing off-axis electron holography, providing information about its local magnetization. DFT calculations were performed to understand the effects of Mn doping, Si-vacancies and surface atoms in the magnetic properties at the surface of the nanowire. An estimation of the Curie temperature was made using the mean field approximation (MFA).
1531	Design and performance of nanoXPS, a new setup for spatially resolved x-ray photoelectron spectromicroscopy at the Swiss Light Source	We report here on the successful design, installation and operation of a high spatial resolution x-ray photoelectron spectrometer, called nanoXPS, at the Swiss Light Source. The new setup works in transmission, and is capable of extracting valuable chemical information with nanoscale resolution on samples deposited on x-ray transparent substrates. A Fresnel zonesplate is used to focus the incoming photon beam and create a nanoprobe beam that crosses the sample. Photoelectrons, generated from the backside of the silicon nitride membranescoated with the sample, are collected by a Specs Phoibos 150 electron analyzer positioned at 45 degrees with respect to the incoming beam direction. By raster scanning the sample acrosssthe x-ray spot, an element specific photoemission image is obtained. The estimated spatial resolution of the chemical imaging was less than 500 nm for present set of measurements, and it can be improved up to a few tens of nanometer. This kind of photoelectron spectromicroscope will allow in-situ measurements with high spatial resolution. Element-specific x-ray photoemission maps can be obtained before and while exposing the sample to gas/gas mixtures to show morphological and chemical changes of the surface.
1532	Nonlinear optical rectification and optical bistability in a coupled asymmetric quantum dot-metal nanoparticle hybrid	We study the optical response of a coupled asymmetric semiconductor quantum dot - spherical metal nanoparticle structure. The asymmetric quantum dot has permanent electric dipole moments that also interact with light. We derive the density matrix equations for the system including the modification of the electric field and the exciton-plasmon coupling. We give emphasis to the effects of the nonlinear optical rectification and controlled optical bistability and analyze these phenomena for different values of the light intensity and different distances between the quantum dot and the metal nanoparticle. We show that when the system is set in a situation where<br />optical bistability can be produced the optical rectification of the hybrid system is bivaluated. We also analyze the slow down to reach the steady state<br />when the system is driven close and far from the turning points.
1533	Collective Density and Energy evolution during Diffusion of Nanoparticles in Polymer Solutions	The diffusion of nanoparticle in polymer solutions has been studied using the dynamic density functional theory. By considering the collective density and free-energy evolution of nanoparticle, we show four different diffusion modes depending mainly on particle size and polymer concentration. Under the condition of low polymer concentration, the diffusion dynamics is controlled by particle free motion. As the concentration increases, if the particle size is comparable to the correlation function of polymer chain, nanoparticle needs to penetrate through a cage and overcome an energy barrier, such that the local diffusion inevitably slows down. Further increase of polymer concentration could result in another caging regime and additional energy barrier. In contrast, large particle can be easily restricted by the surrounding polymer segments, and the local diffusion becomes extremely difficult. In this case, nanoparticle diffusion is controlled by the Rouse dynamics of polymer chains.
1534	Magnetic Domain and Domain Wall Analyses of MnAs Nanodisks Selectively-Grown on Si (111) Substrates	We report on the experimental and analytic results on magnetic domain and domain wall structures of MnAs nanodisks on AlGaAs buffer layers selectively grown on Si (111) substrates partially covered with dielectric SiO<sub>2</sub> thin film mask patterns for the selective-area metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. The results on the size dependence of magnetic domain structures in MnAs nanodisks observed by magnetic force microscopy show that a single domain is predominant in the MnAs nanodisks with an area of approximately 3 x 10<sup>4</sup> nm<sup>2</sup> or less. It is also indicated that multiple domains, in particular, two magnetic domain structures with a 180<sup>o</sup> domain wall are predominant in the nanodisks with an area of approximately 6 x 10<sup>4</sup> nm<sup>2</sup> or more. In addition, in the case of nanodisks with multiple domains, the nanodisks not only with N&eacute;el wall but also with Bloch wall are possibly formed, judging from the detailed analyses of the magnetic force microscope images obtained. These results suggest that the magnetic domains and domain walls are possibly tuned by the control in the MnAs nanodisk size.
1535	<strong>High Speed</strong><strong> Efficient Ultraviolet Photodetector based on Multiple WO<sub>3 </sub>Nanowires</strong>	This work presents the fabrication of multiple WO<sub>3</sub> nanowires photodetector for ultra-violet detection. This photodetector exhibits a photo to the dark current ratio of the order of 4 with a high relative change in conductance around 8100 upon 340 nm illumination at 0.87 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. The photodetector exhibits high responsivity of 47.3 A/W and high 340 nm to 450 nm rejection ratio of ~8800 with excellent stability. Low noise equivalent power (NEP) with 0.37 fW/&radic;Hz and high Detectivity ~10<sup>12</sup> Jones is observed.  We obtained a fast response with rise time (t<sub>r</sub>) of 112 &micro;s and fall time (t<sub>f</sub>) of 84 &micro;s. These promising results demonstrate the applicability of the photodetector for high speed ultra-violet detection.
1536	Distinctive defect states in GaN at low and high Mg concentrations	We demonstrated a wide range of magnesium (Mg) doping control (10<sup>16</sup> &ndash;10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>) in a GaN layer grown by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) on a freestanding GaN substrate and investigated the distinctive defect states at low and high Mg concentrations ([Mg]). Hydrogen concentrations ([H]) in as-grown GaN samples showed a one-to-one<br />relationship with [Mg] over the wide Mg doping range of 6 &times; 10<sup>16</sup> &ndash; 3 &times; 10<sup>19</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> due to the formation of the Mg-H complex, but exhibited gaps between [Mg] and [H] at the low and the high ends of the doping range. At low [Mg], we found that [H] was in good agreement with the sum of [Mg] and carbon (C) concentrations, indicating the formation of the C-H complex. For heavily Mg-doped samples with lower [H], transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning TEM analyses showed that nano-scale defects are formed in the doped layers, and that these defects are pyramidal inversion domains (ID) with Mg segregation at the top (0001) boundary. We estimated the amount of segregated Mg atoms on the basis of our TEM-STEM analyses and concluded that most part of the Mg atoms not forming Mg-H complexes are segregated at the ID boundaries.
1537	Branched InAs nanowire growth by droplet confinement	Anisotropy in crystal growth of III-V semiconductor nanowires can be enhanced by the assistance of a liquid particle. During the past decades, selected scientific works have reported a controlled change of nanowire growth direction by manipulation of the assisting droplet. Although these results are interesting from an engineering point of view, a detailed understanding of the process is necessary in order to rationally design complex nanostructures. In this letter, we utilize our understanding of the growth-assisting droplet to control the morphology and direction of gold-assisted wurtzite-phase InAs nanowires, using controlled droplet displacement followed by resumed growth. By confining the droplet to the nanowire sidewall using zincblende inclusions as barriers, epitaxial growth of horizontal branches from existing nanowires is demonstrated. This is done by tailoring droplet wetting of the nanowire and using identical conditions for nanowire 'stem' and branch growth. This work demonstrates the importance of the droplet dynamics and wetting stability, along with the benefits of crystallographic control, for understanding growth along different directions. Controlled branched growth is one way to achieve designed nanowire networks.
1538	<strong>Amorphous aluminum-oxide supercapacitors</strong>	An amorphous aluminum-oxide supercapacitor can store a large amount of electric charge on its blackish, uneven Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3-x</sub> surface, which have a convexity of 21 nm, AlO<sub>6</sub> clusters, and a resistivity of 16.5 G&Omega;cm. The electric storage can be elucidated by extreme enhanced electron trapping resulting from both the quantum-size effect and the offset effect from positive charges at oxygen-vacancy sites. Here, a supercapacitor, which is characterised by high surface area of ~2,400 m<sup>2</sup>/g and formation of large numbers of electric double layers, demonstrates a vertical line in the Nyquist diagram and rapidly increased the imaginary impedance and phase angle was deduced to &minus;90&deg; with decreasing frequency in the Bode diagram using a distributed constant-electric circuit with a parallel assembly of nanometer-sized capacitors on a highly insulating amorphous aluminum surface. The supercapacitor indicates a switching effect for both positive (~+66 V) and negative (~&minus;11 V) potential.
1539	High spatial coherence in multiphoton-photoemitted electron beams	Nanometer-sharp metallic tips are known to be excellent electron emitters. They are used in highest-resolution electron microscopes in cold field emission mode to generate the most coherent electron beam in continuous-wave operation. For time-resolved operation, sharp metal needle tips have recently been triggered with femtosecond laser pulses. We show here that electrons emitted with near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses at laser oscillator repetition rates show the same spatial coherence properties as electrons in cold field emission mode in cw operation. From electron interference fringes, obtained with the help of a carbon nanotube biprism beam splitter, we deduce a virtual source size of less than 0.65&plusmn;0.06 nm for both operation modes, a factor of ten smaller than the geometrical source size. These results bear promise for ultrafast electron diffraction, ultrafast electron microscopy and other techniques relying on highly coherent and ultrafast electron beams.
1540	<strong>Harnessing the light confinement effect of Si nanowire arrays developed on different crystallographic planes: Insight to light polarization and omnidirectional properties</strong>	In this paper, fabrication of vertical Si nanowire arrays (SiNWAs) by a facile metal assisted electroless etching approach on different crystallographic planes of Si has been reported. A very low specular reflectance (R<em><sub>spec</sub></em>) of 0.04% and 0.03% has been achieved in the whole visible range for SiNWAs grown on Si(100) and Si(111) oriented substrates, respectively. High broadband enhancement has been detected for vertical SiNWAs due to multiple scattering paths inside the nanowire arrays. On the other hand, inclined nanowires showed a fascinating behavior at the longer wavelength regime, where light gets the longer path to reflect back-forth and ease to reflect back outward at normal incidence. Moreover, for [100] SiNWAs, transverse electric (<em>TE</em>) field component demonstrates the strong polarization insensitive properties at the expense of transverse magnetic (<em>TM</em>) field component with a minimum reflectance of &lt; 2% up to 1200 nm. The [100] SiNWAs demonstrates extra-ordinary omnidirectional properties at &theta;<sub>B</sub> &ge; 58&ordm;. COMSOL simulations reveal the effective dipole coupling and the presence of strong harmonic modes for vertical SiNWs at a typical wavelength regime. The highly bound states of the particle tunneling through the classical forbidden region shows a strong dependence on the gradual increment in the refractive index (m<sub>i</sub>) from 1 to 3.4. The strong and intense first order Raman signal located at ~520 cm<sup>-1</sup> demonstrates the asymmetric confinement effect for directional nanowires. This novel finding of describing the light localization properties for SiNWAs with different orientation gives a new route to support various photonic applications.
1541	Modern highly sensitive magnetometry: principles, limits of detection, and pitfalls	In the field of nanomagnetism and spintronics integral magnetometry is nowadays challenged by samples with low magnetic moments and/or low coercive fields. Commercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometers are versatile experimental tools to magnetically characterize samples with ultimate sensitivity as well as with a high degree of automation. For realistic experimental conditions the as-recorded magnetic signal contains several artifacts especially if small signals are measured on top of a large magnetic background or low magnetic fields are required. In this tutorial we will present a representative discussion of artifacts which can occur in studying samples like soft magnetic materials as well as low moment samples. It turns out that special attention is needed to quantify and correct the residual fields of the superconducting magnet to derive useful information from integral magnetometry and to avoid erroneous conclusions.
1542	<strong>A novel effective thermal conductivity model of polymer composites with sheet-like nanoparticles</strong>	In this study, we present a novel theoretical model for effective thermal conductivity aiming to the sheet-like nanoparticle polymer composites and analyse the model by comparing with other relevant models as well as experimental data. We obtain the effective thermal conductivity of a sheet-like nanoparticle with an interphase layer by analysing the different differential equations in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions in a cylindrical coordinate system. Then the present model is established based on the Nan&rsquo;s model and the solutions of these differential equations. The influences of interphase thickness, detailed sheet-like shape, anisotropic thermal conductivity of nanoparticle and volume fraction on the effective thermal conductivity of polymer composites are discussed.

1544	Improving the read-out of the resonance frequency of nanotube mechanical resonators	We report on a new electrical detection method of ultrasensitive carbon nanotube mechanical resonators. The noise floor of the detection method is reduced using a RLC resonator and an amplifier based on a high electron mobility transistor cooled at 4.2 K. This allows us to resolve the resonance frequency of nanotube resonators with an unprecedented quality. We show that the noise of the resonance frequency measured at 4.2 K is limited by the resonator itself, and not by the imprecision of the measurement. The Allan deviation reaches ~10<sup>-5</sup> at 125 ms integration time. When comparing the integration time dependence of the Allan deviation to a power law, the exponent approaches ~ 1/4. The Allan deviation might be limited by the diffusion of particles over the surface of the nanotube. Our work holds promise for mass spectrometry and surface science experiments based on mechanical nano-resonators.
1545	Molecular dynamics study of the thermal conductivity in nanofluids	In this work, the thermal conductivity of a model nanofluid at various volume fractions of nanoparticlessis computed thanks to equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) and non-equilibrium molecular dynamicss(NEMD) simulations. The Green-Kubo formalism is used for the EMD simulations while a net heat flux issimposed on the system with a change of the boundary conditions for the NEMD simulations. The interactionssinside the nanoparticles, between the fluid atoms, and between nanoparticles and fluid atoms are all takensas a Lennard-Jones potential. An empirical parameter, &#x03B6;, is added to the attractive part of the potential toscontrol the hydrophilicity of the nanoparticles, hence controlling how well dispersed are the nanoparticles insthe base fluid. The results show that the aggregation of the nanoparticles does not have a measurable effectson the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid. Nanofluids with volume fractions of 2% and 3% showed ansenhanced thermal conductivity with respect to the bulk fluid. Surprisingly, nanofluids with higher volumesfractions did not show any enhancement of the thermal conductivity.
1546	Electrochemical Methods for Fabrication of Polymers/Calcium Phosphates Nanocomposites as Hard Tissue Implants	Developing and manipulating new biomaterials is an ongoing topic for their needs in medical uses. The evolution and development of new biomaterials, both in the academic and industrial sectors, have been encouraged due to the dramatic improvement in medicine and medical-related technologies. Due to the drawbacks associated with natural biomaterials, using of synthetic biomaterials are preferential due to basic and applied aspects. Various techniques are involved to fabricate biomaterials. Among them are the electrochemical-based methods which include electrodeposition and electrophoretic methods. Although electrospinning and electrospraying are not typical electrochemical methods they are also reviewed in this articles due to their importance. There are many remarkable features that can be acquired from this technique. Electrodeposition and electrophoretic are exceptional and valuable processes for creating a thin or thick coating films on a surface of metallic implants. Electrodeposition and electrophoretic have some common positive features. They can be used at low temperatures, do not affect the structure of the implant and can be applied to complex shapes and they can produce superior properties, such as quick and uniform coating. Furthermore, they can possibly control the thickness and chemical composition of the coatings.  Electrospinning is a potentially emerging and efficient process for producing materials with nanofibrous structures which have exceptional characteristics such as mechanical, pore size and superior surface area. These specialized characteristic induce these nanostructured materials to be used in different technology. This review will focus on the discussion of the electrochemical methods for manipulating biomaterials produced from natural and synthetic polymers.
1547	<strong>In-situ water-assisted structural-manipulation of C1s sp<sup>3</sup>-characteristics in ferromagnetically-filled carbon onions: the case of high pressure Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> Bbmm</strong>	Carbon nano-onions (CNOs) are quasi-spherical fullerene-like structures with 60N<sup>2</sup> carbon atoms (N being the number of carbon layers) self-arranged in carbon shells. Reversible controlled transformations of these nanostructures into nanodiamonds (CNDs) have been recently demonstrated by using a laser wavelength of 532 nm for timescales of 40 min (CNOs to CNDs transformation). However, no studies have yet reported the dynamics of such transitions in metal/carbide filled CNOs (Me-C@CNOs). In this work we have investigated such structural transitions in the case of Fe-C@CNOs with controlled curvature. We find that no CNOs to CNDs conversion is present under prolonged laser-beam irradiation at the temperature of 673 K. Instead a novel re-crystallization effect which leads to progressive increase in the intensities of the D, G and 2D bands is present. This observation is supported by controlled temperature dependent X-ray diffraction measurements in vacuum. In the attempt to control the sp<sup>3</sup> characteristics of the CNOs-shells we have then developed an advanced fabrication method where the controlled addition of water to ferrocene allows to profoundly enhance the sp<sup>3 </sup>carbon-characteristics of the CNOs by progressive oxidation of the encapsulated particles into a high pressure Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> phase.s<p><strong> </strong>
1548	<strong>The Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics of Bi2TexSe3-x Nanosheets </strong>	<strong>The ultrafast dynamics properties of Bi2TexSe3-x Nanosheets are investigated by time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) and pump-probe techniques in visible wavelength and near-infrared wavelength separately. The steady state PL peaks of three nanosheets are asymmetric, because of strong spin-orbit coupling. All the PL lifetimes in 400 nm are around 0.2 ns, dominanted by the charge separation</strong><strong>&#xFF1B;</strong><strong>all the PL lifetimes in 500~550 nm are around 1.2 ns, which are associated with the thermal effects. But in 450nm, with the increase of Se atoms, the ratio of these two effects changes from 2:8 to 6:4, meaning an obvious reverse of dominant mechanism. The electron-phonon relaxation lifetime, measured by pump-probe in near-infrared wavelength (1550 nm), is changed from 1.49 ps to 0.85 ps with the value of X from 3 to 0. It proves indirectly the previous conclusion that the increase of Se atoms could enhanced the thermal effects. This essay suggests a method for quantitative comparison of the dominant mechanism transform in topological Insulator Bi2TexSe3-x  nanosheets or other similar materials, which is beneficial to  their photoelectric applications.</strong>
1549	The diode characteristic and prefect spin-filtering effect of zigzag SiC nanoribbon heterojuction with Boron and Nitrogen impurities	Based on a Zigzag Silicon Carbon nanoribbon with width 4 (4ZSiCNR), we construct a heterojunction through different substitutional impurities. The left part of junction is Boron-doped at the Si-edge of 4ZSiCNR (B-4ZSiCNR), and the right part is Nitrogen-doped at the C-edge of 4ZSiCNR (N-4ZSiCNR). Our results show that B-4ZSiCNR and N-4ZSiCNR exhibit half-metallic features at ferromagnetic state, which provides the possibility to design spin nanodevices. By performing first-principle quantum transport calculations, spin-dependent transport properties in different magnetic configurations are studied. Current-voltage curves show prefect spin-filtering and negative differential resistance effects when the two electrodes are polarized with different spin orientations. When the two electrodes are polarized with up spin orientations, the heterojunction can be used as a diode. Through detailed analysis of two electrodes&rsquo; band structures along with the transmission spectra, the interesting transport behaviors can be understood. Besides, the Bloch states of spin-polarized bands crossing the Fermi level can help us to understand the appearance of the negative differential resistance effect.
1550	<strong>High-quality AlN film achieved by growth-mode modification using sputtered AlN buffer</strong>	We proposed a strategy to obtain high-quality AlN film by combining growth-mode modification with sputtered AlN buffer using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Compared with the AlN film grown on the island-like MOCVD AlN buffer, that grown on the flatter sputtered AlN buffer demonstrates a weaker three-dimensional (3D) growth and an earlier growth-mode transition from 3D to two-dimensional (2D), facilitating the faster coalescence of the surface. As a result, a 5.6-&mu;m-thick crack-free AlN film is achieved with a root-mean-square of 0.14 nm over 3 &times; 3 &mu;m<sup>2</sup>. It is found dislocations in the AlN film grown on the sputtered AlN buffer can be significantly suppressed through two new channels: high-density nanoscale voids and 90&deg; dislocation bending. Plan-view scanning tunnel electron microscope shows the threading dislocation density is dramatically reduced to 4.7 &times; 10<sup>7</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is extremely low for AlN film grown on sapphire. This very simple yet effective technique demonstrates great potential for the mass-fabrication of low-cost and high-performance deep-ultraviolet devices.
1551	A spatially smoothed device model for meso-structured perovskite solar cells	Meso-structured perovskite solar cell (PSC), utilizing a mesoporous absorber layer consisting of mesoporous metal oxide and perovskite material inside, is still delivering the highest solar cell efficiency for perovskite-based type solar cells up to date. Its outstanding performance critically depends on the nanoscopic morphology formed inside the mesoporous absorber layer. This, however, is not accounted in most perovskite device models, as they are based on an effective-medium formulation for the mesoporous absorber layer and the details of its underlying morphology are ignored. The mesoporous absorber layer is treated as a two-phase model that describes intrinsic solar cell physics such as free charge carrier generation, carrier transport, and recombination within the two phases, as well as at the interface between the two phases. We derive a spatially smoothed device model for meso-structured PSCs based on volume-averaging of electric potential, electron and hole concentrations of the two-phase model and this spatially smoothed formulation captures two essential morphological descriptors that are not found in existing effective-medium formulations for meso-structured PSCs, namely surface-to-volume ratio and porosity inside the mesoporous layer. Furthermore, we determine the explicit functional forms of the effective parameters in the spatially smoothed model for the case of an ideal &ldquo;Spaghetti&rdquo; blend morphology.
1552	Electrically controllable spin-polarized transport in bilayer graphene with Rashba spin-orbit interaction	We study spin-polarized transport in bilayer graphene nanoribbons (BGNs) in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) and external gate voltages. It is found that Rashba SOI alone in BGNs can only generate current with spin polarization along the in-plane y direction. The spin polarization can be significantly enhanced by the interlayer asymmetry or longitudinal mirror asymmetry produced by external gate voltages, and the polarization components can be found along the x, y and z directions. Spin current with high spin polarization and high flexibility in the orientation can be obtained in the proposed device. Our findings shed new light on the generation of highly spin-polarized current in BGNs without external magnetic fields, which could have useful applications in spintronics device design.
1553	<strong>Effects of modal phonon local non-equilibrium in thermal reservoirs on thermal conductivity prediction using molecular dynamics</strong>	Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics, which is widely adopted to study heat conduction in bulk materials and nanostructures, uses thermal reservoirs to prescribe temperatures. A basic requirement for thermal reservoir is that different phonon modes are at thermal equilibrium. In this work, based on spectral phonon temperature analysis, the modal phonon temperatures are extracted from the overall temperature in graphene using the Berendsen, Nos&eacute;-Hoover and Langevin thermostats. It is found that although all the modes are at equilibrium in the Langevin reservoir, the phonon modes are in local non-equilibrium in the Berendsen and Nos&eacute;-Hoover thermostats, with optical phonons overheated in the hot reservoir and overcooled in the cold reservoir. This local non-equilibrium significantly affects the thermal conductivity calculation. Taking graphene as an example, we find that the Berendsen and Nos&eacute;-Hoover reservoirs predict lower thermal conductivity compared to the Langevin thermostat, owing to the over-excitation of optical phonons. Our work also helps explain some measured apparent thermal conductivities where the heating or cooling are inherently non-equilibrium.
1554	Piezoelectric modulation of nonlinear optical response in BaTiO<sub>3</sub> thin film	We study the nonlinear optical response in a strained thin film ferroelectric oxide BaTiO3 using piezoelectric Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) (001) as a variable strain substrate and La-doped SrTiO3 as a conductive buffer layer. The rotation-anisotropic second harmonic intensity profile shows hysteretic modulation corresponding to strain variation from the inverse piezoelectric response of the substrate. An enhancement of 15% is observed at 1.2 kV/cm, while a control sample shows negligible change as a function of piezovoltage. Reflection high-energy electron diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal the epitaxial interface. X-ray diffraction and piezoresponse force microscopy confirm tetragonal distortion and ferroelectricity of the BTO overlayer. Our results suggest a promising route to enhance the performance of nonlinear optical oxides for the development of novel nano-opto-mechanical devices.
1555	<strong>Phonon scattering by antiphase boundaries in the Fe<sub>2</sub>VAl Heusler alloy</strong>	The Fe<sub>2</sub>VAl Heusler alloy, which crystallizes in the L2<sub>1</sub> structure at 300 K, undergoes two order-disorder phase transitions to the B2 and A2 structures at high temperature. Quenching this alloy from temperatures where the disordered B2 or A2 structure are stable, allows stabilizing a nanostructured variant of Fe<sub>2</sub>VAl containing L2<sub>1</sub> antiphase domains (APDs) separated by antiphase boundaries (APBs). The size of these APDs can be controlled by the quenching rate and ranges from ca. 280 mm to 95 nm. An analysis of the lattice thermal conductivity (<em>l</em><em><sub>L</sub></em>) by a modified Callaway model shows that the APBs can scatter the phonons, leading to a significant reduction of up to 20 % at 300 K for this quantity. Hence, phonon scattering by APBs provides a new method towards lower thermal conductivity in Fe<sub>2</sub>VAl.
1556	Transport properties and thermoelectric effects in gated silicene superlattices	Low-dimensional thermoelectricity opens the possibility of improving the performance and the efficiency of thermoelectric devices by redistributing the electron density of states through the reduction of dimensionality. In this work, we explore this possibility in silicene by reducing its dimensionality through the periodic arrangement of gated electrodes, the so-called gated silicene superlattices. Silicene electrons were described quantum relativistically. The transmission, conductance and thermoelectric properties were obtained with the transfer matrix method, the Landauer-B&uuml;ttiker formalism and the Cutler-Mott formula, respectively. We find that the redistribution of the density of states together with the intrinsic characteristics of silicene, the local band gap and the large spin-orbit coupling, confabulate to the enhancement of the thermoelectric properties. In particular, the Seebeck coefficient and the power factor reach values two and three orders of magnitude higher than those found in gated graphene superlattices. These findings in conjunction with the low thermal conductivity of silicene indicate that silicene-based nanostructures could be the basis to more efficient thermoelectric devices.
1557	A 3-mirror Surface Force Balance for the investigation of liquids confined to nanoscale films between two ultra-smooth polarizable electrodes	We present a new technique, based on the Surface Force Balance (SFB), for the direct measurement of surface forces between two ultra-smooth and polarizable gold electrode surfaces across thin fluid films. Combining the direct interferometric measurement of surface separation and contact geometry with smooth electrode surfaces has proved challenging in the past, and for this reason previous measurements with the SFB typically involved two insulating mica surfaces, or one mica surface and one electrode surface, or an alternative less direct measure of the surface separation. Here, we demonstrate that a 3-mirror interferometer can overcome these difficulties:  the setup involves two ultra-smooth electrode/mirror surfaces between which the fluid is confined,  and a third mirror to allow for interferometric detection of the liquid thickness with nanometer resolution and at thicknesses much smaller than the diffraction limit of the light. We conclude with a proof-of-concept measurement across dry nitrogen gas. The technique should prove useful for studying the properties of fluids confined at the nanoscale inside a slit-pore of controlled electrical potential or subject to applied electric fields.
1558	Performance Enhanced Flexible Terahertz Modulators Based on Graphene FET with Organic High-K Dielectric Coating Layer	Fabricating a graphene field-effect-transistor (GFET) on a Polyethylene- Terephthalate (PET) substrate gives rise to a flexible THz modulator with a unfulfilling modulation depth (MD) of 15~20%. In this work, we proposed a robust graphene modulating layer where the graphene monolayer is coated with a high-K dimethyl sulfoxide layer (DMSO). With this organic nano-coating the intrinsic MD of the GFET based THz modulator is significantly enhanced to ~40% while maintaining a low insert loss (IL) of 1.3dB. Adouble modulating-layers modulator with a MD of 70% and a multilevel modulator with 4 levels amplitude shift keying (ASK) modulation are also successfully realized. The large intrinsic MD, low IL, as well as its flexibility, render this enhanced modulator extremely versatile in fabrication of novel devices for nonplanar THz applications.
1559	<strong>Electrical properties of boron-incorporated ultrananocrystalline diamond/hydrogenated amorphous carbon composite films</strong>	Boron-incorporated ultrananocrystalline diamond/hydrogenated amorphous carbon composite (UNCD/a-C:H) films were deposited by coaxial arc plasma deposition with boron-blended graphite targets. The effects of boron incorporation on the electrical properties of the films were investigated by hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Their electrical conductivity increased from 10<sup>&minus;7</sup> to 10<sup>&minus;1</sup> &Omega;<sup>&minus;1</sup>&middot;cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> with increasing boron content up to 5 at.%. From the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity, hopping conduction due to localized states produced by boron atoms is predominant in carrier transport. X-ray photoelectron spectra showed the shifts of Fermi levels toward the top of valence band with increasing boron content. It implies that boron atoms in the films leads to form localized states, which results in enhanced electrical conductivity.
1560	An atomistic model for the charge distribution in layered MoS2	We present an atomistic model for predicting the distribution of doping electric charges in layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). This model mimics the charge around each ion as a net Gaussian-spatially-distributed charge plus an induced dipole, and is able to predict the distribution of doping charges in layered MoS2 in a self-consistent scheme. The profiles of doping charges in monolayer MoS2 flakes computed by this charge-dipole model are in good agreement with those obtained by density-functional-theory calculations. Using this model, we quantitatively predict the charge enhancement effect in MoS2 monolayer nanoribbons, with which strong ionic charge-localization effects are shown.
1561	Enhanced four-wave mixing in waveguides integrated with graphene oxide	We demonstrate enhanced four-wave mixing (FWM) in doped silica waveguides integrated with graphene oxide (GO). Owing to strong mode overlap between the integrated waveguides and GO films that have a high Kerr nonlinearity and low loss, the FWM efficiency of the hybrid integrated waveguides can be significantly improved. We perform FWM measurements for different pump powers, wavelength detuning, GO coating lengths, and number of GO layers. Our experimental results show good agreement with theory, achieving up to ~9.5-dB enhancement in the FWM conversion efficiency for a 1.5-cm-long waveguide integrated with 2 layers of GO. We show theoretically that for different waveguide geometries an even higher enhancement in FWM efficiency of ~20 dB can be obtained. Finally, we theoretically show that FWM in silicon waveguides (both thin nanowire and slot waveguides) incorporating GO films can be enhanced by more than 35 dB. This demonstrates the effectiveness of introducing GO films into integrated photonic devices in order to enhance the performance of nonlinear optical processes.
1562	Effects of Curing Temperature and Nanofillers on Mechanical and Piezoresistive Properties of PDMS/MWCNT Hybrid Films	In this study, the conductive polymer nanocomposites (CPNCs) of PDMS/MWCNT hybrid films were prepared using the layer-by-layer (LBL) production method. The sandwich-structured films containing an ultrathin layer of piezoresistive nanocomposite were manufactured by means of the vacuum filtration method. In order to apply this technique, a suspension of CNT particles was prepared and the piezoresistive nanocomposite was manufactured. In the following, the mechanical properties of both pure PDMS and PDMS/MWCNT nanocomposite were investigated using a tensile test and Dynamic-Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA), and the results were discussed. Finally, the piezoresistive properties of the hybrid film, which contains an ultrathin layer of PDMS/MWCNT nanocomposite, were measured and the piezoresistive defects such as creep and hysteresis effects were investigated.
1563	<strong>Microstructural, vibrational, dielectric and ferroelectric properties correlation in hot-pressed PbMg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ceramics</strong>	Microstrctural, vibrational, ferroelectric and dielectric properties investigation reveals non-stoichiometric chemical ordered regions (CORs) and relaxor like dielectric characteristics in lead magnesium niobate (PMN) ceramics uniaxially hot pressed (HP) at 800 <sup>o</sup>C to 1200 <sup>o</sup>C. Occurance of (&frac12;&frac12;&frac12;) superlattice reflections along &lt;111&gt; in &lt;110&gt; zone axis SAED pattern as well as the presence of bright nano-meter regions in corresponding dark-field images in 800 <sup>o</sup>C hot pressed PMN demonstrates formation of the CORs as soon as perovskite phase is formed during calcination and remains unaffected with HP sintering tempreature. Lattice constant is observed to be invarint with HP sintering temperature. Separation between two broad peaks of Nb-O-Nb stretching mode is found to increase from 76.7 to 86.2 cm<sup>-1</sup> and the red-shift of O-B-O bending modes near 265 cm<sup>-1</sup> suggest an increase in the polar nano-size regions. Dielectric constant maximum (&epsilon;<sub>m</sub>) is increased from 8800 to 25000 and temperature of &epsilon;<sub>m</sub> (T<sub>m</sub>) is shifted from 278 K to 263 K with increasing average grain size from ~ 1.1 &mu;m to 2.8 &mu;m. Grain size dependence of the &epsilon;<sub>m</sub> and shifting of the T<sub>m</sub> towards lower temperature is correlated with core: shell thickness ratio calculated from the core-shell model. Increase in Grain and grain boundary resistances calculated from impedance spectroscopy and maximum polarization (P<sub>max</sub>) obtained from field induced polarization switching are consistent with the grain size analysis.
1564	The effect of Ti<sup>+</sup> ion implantation on the Anatase- Rutile Phase Transformation and Resistive Switching properties of TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films	We investigate here the structural phase transformation and electrical Resistive Switching (RS)<br />properties of TiO2 thin films (80 nm) after their self ion implantation with 50 keV Ti<sup>+</sup> ions at several<br />fluences. UV-Raman, GIXRD, TEM, XPS and AFM techniques have been utilized to investigate<br />the modifications in thin films. Both, the as-grown and ion implanted, films display mixed phases<br />of rutile (R) and anatase (A). Surprisingly, however, a phase transition from A to R is observed<br />at a critical fluence, where some anatase content transforms into rutile. Such ion beam induced<br />structural phase transformation has not been explored earlier in TiO2 thin films. This A to R<br />transformation increases with additional fluence. The critical fluence found by GIXRD is slightly<br />smaller (1&times;10<sup>13</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup>) than from UV-Raman (1&times;10<sup>14</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup>), indicating the first initiation<br />of phase transformation probably in bulk. All the films contain anatase in nanocrystalline form<br />also and the phase transformation seems to take place via aggregation of anatase nanoparticles.<br />Thin films also show the presence of oxygen vacancies (OV) Ti<sup>3+</sup>, whose number grow with fluence.<br />These OVs as well as thermal spikes created during Ti<sup>+</sup> ion implantation are also crucial for the<br />A-R transition. After implantation at the highest fluence, TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films show bipolar resistive<br />switching behavior. Development of conducting filament, formed by the migration of many oxygen<br />vacancies generated during ion implantation, can be responsible for this behavior.
1565	<strong>Perspective: Nanomaterials Design with High Pressure</strong>	The high pressure and high temperature phase diagrams of nanomaterials often differ significantly from their bulk parents offering novel approaches for the engineering of original materials. The importance or even the dominance of surface atoms in the nanoworld enhance the effects of the environment, geometry or even of intercalation if relevant. We explore the present knowledge and future opportunities of such effects on the high pressure phase diagrams of nanomaterials as nanocrystals, carbon nanotubes, fullerites, graphene and other 2D systems as well as nanoporous structures like clathrates or zeolites. Recent advances and future challenges in the use of extreme thermodynamic conditions to develop new functional nanomaterials, composites or devices will be reviewed together with the specificities of the experimental environment required for these investigations.
1566	Ion-implanted Silver Nanoparticles for Metal-Enhanced Fluorescence	Metal Enhanced Fluorescence (MEF) has promising applications in the field of optical displays, bio-sensing and photodynamic therapy. In this work, we exploit the plasmons of embedded silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) fabricated by ion implantation to enhance the fluorescence of Coumarin515 dye (C515) via MEF. Ion Implantation of 70 keV Ag ions in quartz matrix at different fluences was carried out to synthesize Ag nanoparticles inside quartz matrix. The formation of Ag NPs is characterized by the optical absorption measurements and approximate sizes of Ag NPs was obtained from the fitting of the optical absorption spectra with Mie theory calculations. Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) measurement was used to obtain the depth profile and concentration Ag within the substrate. From the RBS results, it was determined that front edge of the layer containing Ag was formed at an average depth of 16 nm below the surface, which closely agreed with Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM) calculations. Increase in the size of the NPs is observed as the fluence of the Ag within the substrate is increased. The MEF of drop casted C515 dye was studied using steady-state emission and excitation spectra measurements. Fluorescence enhancement factor ranging from 1.0 to 2.1 with a maximum enhancement for the largest size NP was obtained. The observed MEF was ascribed to a combination of plasmon enhancement with larger nanoparticles and to increased plasmonic hot spots.
1567	Multiphysics rectification of light and heat using liquid crystal	The detection and treatment of signals, as optical and thermal ones, are crucial for many relevant applications. Employing nanostructured metamaterials to design broken spatial inversion symmetry devices it were created interesting rectifiers, as  optical and thermal diodes.  However, such devices are monophysics, rectifying only one kind of energy. Here we show a multiphysics diode that rectifies simultaneously light and heat. It consists of a capillary tube keeping a nematic liquid crystal that holds an escaped radial disclination: an axial asymmetric defect the spontaneously arises in cylindrical cavities. Using the properties of the 5CB liquid crystal, we numerically measured thermal and optical rectifications of, respectively, 3.5\% and 120\%, comparable to carbon nanotube thermal diodes and  photonic-crystal-based optical diodes. From thermal, shape and molecular studies developed in this work, we concluded low working heat flux eases both optical and thermal rectifications, miniaturizing the multiphysics diodes favors thermal and disfavors optical rectifications, and both rectifications has different optimal molecular configurations. We believe the presented multiphysics diode can contribute to save materials,  increase information processed,   miniaturize complex systems and develop new structured devices.
1568	Multi-scale study of the deformation mechanisms of thermoelectric p-type half-Heusler Hf<sub>0.44</sub>Zr<sub>0.44</sub>Ti<sub>0.12</sub>CoSb<sub>0.8</sub>Sn<sub>0.2</sub>	Increasing the figure of merit ZT of thermoelectric (TE) alloys is a challenge that is currently attempted through various metallurgy methods, including nanostructuring and dislocation engineering. Microstructures with such level of complexity raises questions about the mechanical reliability of these new materials. Indeed, despite the values of hardness and elastic modulus known for the clear majority of TE materials, the data on deformation mechanisms are still rare. Focusing on the nanostructured p-type half-Heusler Hf<sub>0.44</sub>Zr<sub>0.44</sub>Ti<sub>0.12</sub>CoSb<sub>0.8</sub>Sn<sub>0.2</sub>, our multi-scale study aims to analyze the deformation mechanisms. Experiments conducted at macro-, meso- and micro-scale are designed to trigger and assess plasticity mechanisms. Compression testing on bulk samples subject to a confining pressure environment and temperature leads to an exclusive brittle failure. The mixed-mode failure mechanisms involve switching between intra- and inter-granular crack propagation, depending on the grain size met by the crack tip. Indentation toughness at meso-scale generates cracks, while TEM analysis of the crack tip area confirms no dislocation activity and 3D-EBSD technique confirms the mixed crack propagation behavior. At micro-scale, micro-pillar compression stress-strain curves and failure mechanisms are comparable with bulk samples testing analysis. These results can be used to provide design guidelines for more crack-resistant TE alloys.
1569	<strong>Hydrophobic Magnetorheological Suspension</strong>	We developed hydrophobic magnetorheological suspensions with improved stability against gravity. The space-spanning particle network arising from hydrophobic aggregation is responsible for this enhancement. The hydrophobic effect in the presence of field is overcome by decreasing amount of hydrophobic particles or the addition of magnetic nanoparticle leaving magnetorheological suspension a considerable magnetorheological response. This work emphasizes the advantage of hydrophobic force in control of sedimentation stability without the need for any anti-setting additive.

The surfaces of the nanoparticles were uniformly covered with iron oxide (Fe<em><sub>x</sub></em>O<em><sub>y</sub></em>). The resulting nanoparticles possessed a graded core/oxide shell structure and unique physical properties.

1571	Crucial role of electron correlation for conductance of &#xF070;-conjugated wires: a generalized tight-binding model	We propose to use the quasi-correlated tight-binding (QCTB) pi-approximation for treating single molecule electronics problems and demonstrate its advantages. Previously, this generalized tight-binding (TB) method has been elaborated for describing effectively unpaired electrons and other properties of large-scale bipartite (alternant) networks. Here, we construct a one-electron Green's function matrix (Greenian) at the QCTB level, and present analytic solutions for finite-size polyene chains and other conjugated molecules. The simplified wide band limit model is assumed in most formal and numerical computations. We give an efficient computational scheme which incorporates the bipartite symmetry of effective pi-electron Hamiltonians we construct. The known selection rule for electric conductance in bipartites is extended to take into account the imaginary part of Greenians. It is shown that even a very simple inclusion of pi-electron correlation effects removes specific quantum interference nodes (antiresonances) which occur within the standard tight-binding (TB) model. Systematic computations of the Greenian matrices at the full configuration interaction (FCI) level confirm this prediction about instability of the TB Greenian nodes with respect to more advanced theories. We find that QCTB results are frequently not numerically accurate compared to FCI. Nevertheless, in qualitative and quantitative terms QCTB, performed with the same ease as TB, provides an essential advance over TB. As an example of using QCTB for large systems we analyze conductance spectra in graphene nanoflakes. In particular, we show that 'zigzag' connections can afford significantly higher electron transmission than 'armchair' connections.
1572	Selective Activation of an Isolated Magnetic Skyrmion in the Ferromagnetic Background with Microwave Electric Fields	We theoretically reveal that pure eigenmodes of an isolated magnetic skyrmion in the ferromagnetic background can be selectively activated using microwave electric fields, without exciting gigantic ferromagnetic resonances, in contrast to conventional methods using microwave magnetic fields. We also demonstrate that this selective activation of a skyrmion can drive its translational motion in the ferromagnetic nanotrack efficiently under an external magnetic field inclined from the normal direction. It is found that a mode with combined breathing and rotational oscillations induces much faster propagation than the breathing mode studied previously by Wang $et$ $al.$ [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 92}, 020403(R) (2015)].
1573	Optically Modulated Electric Synapses Realized with Memristors Based on ZnO Nanorods	Artificial synapses based on compact nanodevices are indispensable building blocks for implementing artificial neural networks in hardware. In this work, we demonstrate optically modulated artificial synapses realized with ZnO nanorods. These artificial synapses advance preceding memristive synapses with regard to the ability of response to not only electric but also optical modulation. The high surface state densities of the ZnO nanorods endow the present device with high photoresponse, resulting in the optical encryption effect, while the subsequent decryption can be realized by applying electric pulses. The optical encryption and electrical decryption functions provide a novel concept to process massive data for artificial neural networks. Moreover, with the aid of the optical modulation, new methods are opened up for future optically-tuned synaptic devices for secured communications.
1574	Glass Fracture by Focusing of Laser-Generated Nanosecond Surface Acoustic Waves	Dynamic fracture of borosilicate glass through focusing of high-amplitude nanosecond surface acoustic waves (SAWs) at the micron scale is investigated in an all-optical experiment. SAWs are generated by an intense picosecond laser excitation pulse focused into a ring-shaped spot on the sample surface. Interferometric imaging of the sample surface with a femtosecond probe pulse allows quantitative measurement of the vertical surface displacements. Images taken at different pump-probe delays capture the SAW as it converges towards the center, focuses, and subsequently diverges. The amplitude of the SAW is varied by changing the laser excitation energy. Above a certain laser excitation energy threshold, a damage at the acoustic focal point is observed. A post-mortem investigation reveals a crater formed by the ejection of a piece of material. Numerical calculations matching the measured surface displacement profiles help us determine the time evolution of the stress distribution in the sample and at the acoustic focus. We find that the glass withstands a nanosecond local tensile stress of at least 6 GPa without visible fracture, which is well above the tensile limit observed in conventional shock spallation experiments.
1575	PROBING ELASTIC PROPERTIES OF NANOWIRE-BASED STRUCTURES	We report the analysis of elastic properties of a composite medium consisting of GaN nanowires embedded into a dielectric matrix, which constitutes the active material of nanowire-based piezogenerators. A non-invasive technique, Transient Grating Method, is used to generate and analyse the propagation of acoustic waves in the frequency range from a few tens of MHz to several GHz. Effective elastic moduli of the composite anisotropic material are restored then via the minimization of the discrepancy between the measured and calculated wave characteristics. The latter are simulated using the time-efficient computer model based on the explicit integral and asymptotic representations of laser-generated surface acoustic waves in layered anisotropic waveguides. The method adapts the Green's matrix formalism to the laminated composite medium under consideration. A comparison with a reference composed of a dielectric matrix without nanowires shows that the mechanical behavior is strongly influenced by the presence of the nanostructures.
1576	<strong>Exploration of the adsorption behaviors of group-IV tin nanotubes from DFT computations: A search for superior SO<sub>2</sub> gas sensors</strong>	The structural and electronic properties of the pristine and SO<sub>2</sub> adsorbed buckled tin nanotubes were investigated using the density functional theory calculations. The effects of SO<sub>2</sub> gas adsorption on the electronic structure of the nanotubes were analyzed in detail. SO<sub>2</sub> molecule was initially positioned on the armchair and zigzag stanene based nanotubes with orientations through both interacting sulfur and oxygen sites. The results suggest that the considered armchair nanotubes have direct band gaps at the K point, which indicate the semiconductor characteristics of these nanotubes, making them efficient candidates for gas sensing applications. Moreover, the considered (9, 0) and (10, 0) zigzag nanotubes exhibit also semiconductor behavior. Among the armchair nanotubes, the adsorption energy of SO<sub>2</sub> molecule on the (8, 8) armchair nanotube is the highest (most negative) of all, representing that SO<sub>2</sub> interaction with (8, 8) nanotube is energetically most favorable. The adsorption energy slightly increases with increasing the nanotube diameter. Besides, the adsorption of SO<sub>2</sub> molecule on the nanotube surface through its oxygen atoms is more favorable in energy than the adsorption by its central sulfur atom. The projected density of states of the interacting Sn and oxygen atoms show the formation of chemical bonds between these atoms, as evidenced by the increment of electronic density at the middle of the newly formed bonds predicted by charge density difference (CDD) calculations. Based on CDD calculations, we found the charge accumulation on the adsorbed SO<sub>2</sub> molecule, which indicates that SO<sub>2</sub> acts as a charge acceptor.
1577	In an Ionic Liquid, High Local Friction is Determined by the Proximity to the Charge Network	Structural heterogeneity in ionic liquids is to a large extent defined by nanoscale apolar pockets that act as spacers between strings of positive and negative charges that alternate. In contrast to this, recent work from our group and that of others appear to indicate that dynamic, energetic and mechanical heterogeneities are governed by the charged part of the liquid. In this article we study the dynamics of methane, a small apolar solute in the family of Ionic Liquids (ILs) s1-Alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Im1,n/NTf2-), with n=2, 4, 8 at temperatures that make the viscosity for each liquid similar and around 8 cP. We do this in an attempt to equalize the effect of the solvent on the dynamics of the solute. In all cases, we find that solute proximity to charge-enhanced regions coincides with translationally caged regimes (high local friction) whereas the opposite is true in charge-depleted regions. In a way, these ILs behave like a liquid within a liquid where the charge network is the high friction component.
1578	<strong>Flexible Graphene Composites with High Thermal Conductivity for Heat Dissipation in High Power LEDs</strong>	Multifunctional flexible graphene composites (FGCs) have been fabricated by using a mold-casting method. The acrylic co-polymers matrix of FGCs has an elastic modulus in the range of 18-68 MPa and high mechanical strength suitable for heat dissipation for lighting applications. Scanning electron microscopy images show that the graphene nanoplatelets in the FGCs coalesce in the through-plane direction, enhance their thermal conductivity by increasing the inter-sheet contacts among graphene nanoplatelets, and reduce the defects and grain boundaries. The heat dissipation properties of the FGCs were compared with these for aluminum heat sinks. For this, the operating temperature in the emitting area of a high-power UV-LED was measured as a function of the weight for each type of heat sink. Experiments on LEDs demonstrated that the FGCs with masses of 4.9 g and 5.5 g cooled down the hottest points on the LEDs at similar temperatures observed when the LED is operating on an aluminum heat sink with mass of 565 g. The heat dissipation results demonstrated that the FGCs could be used as compact and lightweight heat sinks for high power LEDs employed as lighting sources.
1579	Structural dynamics of LaVO3 on the nanosecond time scale	Due to the strong dependence of electronic properties on the local bonding environment, a full characterization of the structural dynamics in ultrafast experiments is a critical. Here we report the dynamics and complete structural refinement at nanosecond time scales of a perovskite thin film by combining optical excitation with time-resolved X-ray diffraction. This is achieved by monitoring the temporal response of both integer and half-integer diffraction peaks of LaVO3 in response to an above-band-gap 800 nm pump pulse. We find that the lattice expands by 0.1% out of plane, and the relaxation is characterized by a biexponential decay with 2 ns and 12 ns time scales. We analyze the relative intensity change of half-integer peaks and show that the distortions to the substructure are small: the oxygen octahedral rotation angles decrease by &#xF07E;0.3&#x00BA; and La displacements decrease by ~0.2 pm, which directly corresponds to a ~0.8{degree sign} increase in the V-O-V bond-angles, an in-plane V-O bond length reduction of ~0.3 pm, and an unchanged out-of-plane bond length. This provides experimentally accessible values for structural and electronic tunability in this class of materials.
1580	<strong>     Thermoelectric properties of nanostructured bismuth telluride (Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>) with annealing time and its composite with reduced graphene oxide (RGO)</strong>	In the present work, thermoelectric performance of EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) assisted bismuth telluride (Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>), prepared by hydrothermal technique has been investigated. The samples after preparation are annealed in vacuum chamber at 100<sup>0</sup> C for 6 hours and 10 hours to compare its properties with sample without annealing. The results show that the materials are nanocrystalline in nature, having rhombohedral lattice structure with preferred orientation along (015) direction. Lattice parameters from Rietveld refinement shows that &lsquo;a&rsquo; decreases while &lsquo;c&rsquo; increases with annealing time for Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>. Thermoelectric performance of the samples improve significantly with annealing time by one order of magnitude. These observations are in tune with the presence of antisite defects where Bi lattice sites are occupied by excess Te. Composites of Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) (1 &amp; 3 wt%) (10 h) have been prepared and characterized to investigate thermoelectric performance. For Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>- RGO (1 wt%) composite, a maximum value of ZT (0.29), higher than Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3,</sub> at room temperature is obtained due to increase in electrical conductivity of the composites.
1581	Y-doping TiO2 compact layer for efficient perovskite solar cells	To improve the electron transporting and suppress the charge recombination between the interface of TiO2/perovskite, a smooth and compact Y-doping TiO2 compact layer was successfully prepared by hydrolysis-pyrolysis method using an acidic titanium isopropoxide solution in isopropanol and yttrium chloride hexahydrate (YCl3&#x2022;6H2O) was used as the yttrium source. The influence of Y-doping on the microstructure, crystal phase, chemical composition, optical absorption of the TiO2 compact layer was investigated. And the electron transporting and charge recombination in the TiO2/perovskite interface of the corresponding solar cells were systemically analyzed. The planar perovskite solar cells based on the Y-doping TiO2 compact layer with a Y/Ti molar ratio of 5% obtained a photoelectric conversion efficieny (PCE) of 15.22%, while the undoped perovskite solar cells gave a PCE of 14.05%. When the 200-nm length TiO2 nanorod array was introduced between the 5% Y-doping TiO2 electron transporting layer and the perovskite thin film, the corresponding perovskite solar cells achieved a PCE of 18.32% under illumination of simulated AM 1.5 sunlight (100 mA&#x2022;cm-2).
1582	<strong>Conductive tail-to-tail domain walls in epitaxial BiFeO<sub>3</sub> films</strong>	The complex conductive behavior of ferroelectric domain walls is attracting more and more attention for its potential application as an independent nanoelectronic component. For the (001) epitaxial BiFeO<sub>3</sub> films, we find that the domain wall conductivity is various among 71&deg; domain walls, with tail-to-tail (T-T) domain walls more conductive than head-to-head (H-H) and head-to-tail (H-T) ones. Furthermore, it is observed that most of the conductive areas are composed by two parallel lines around the T-T domain walls. These experimental results can be well simulated by our newly-developed theoretical model based on the polarization configuration and a tunneling mechanism. Our work will help to understand the mechanism of domain wall conductance in materials and further promote the usage of domain walls in advanced nano-devices.
1583	A Hierarchical Approach to Chemical and Aggregate Equilibria	A new paradigm is presented to describe and quantify chemical equilibria.  The approach is especially useful for reactions yielding a quasi-continuous size distribution such as aggregation or polymerization.  The mean aggregation number &lt;N&gt;i is the central quantifying parameter where i is an index for the structural level in a hierarchical model. The change in Gibbs free energy for aggregation (or polymerization) is given by &#x2206;G2=-RT ln&#x2061;&#x3016;(1/&lt;N&gt;2)&#x3017;. Rather than postulating the equilibrium of chemical potentials as the starting point, the ansatz relies on a differential equation expressing the balance between subunit dissociation/association and the concentration of free particles. From this consideration a series of relations are derived, among others, the underlying thermodynamic pseudo-potential/chemical potential of the association/dissociation process. The compatibility of the approach with previous results like the law of mass action or the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is demonstrated. Discrete distributions in the degree of aggregation as well as quasi-continuous distributions can be elegantly derived and can be connected to the respective free energies. The work concludes with example calculations for a micellar and a colloidal pigment nano-particle system.
1584	Raman analysis of strain in p-type doped silicon nanostructures	In this work, 100 nm-thick boron-doped silicon beams with doping levels between 1&middot;10<sup>16</sup> and 1&middot;10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> undergoing uniaxial tensile strain are investigated by Raman spectroscopy. The structures exhibit a noticeable reduction in Young&rsquo;s modulus (~20%) compared with the value reported for bulk. The traditional Raman shift coefficients used to determine stress and strain in bulk structures are revised and appropriate corrections are implemented to account for the observed changes in Young&rsquo;s modulus. Interestingly, the Raman shift-strain relation in silicon nanostructures with strain along the [110] direction is found to be independent of size effects and doping. In contrast, the Raman shift-stress relation is found to be highly dependent on size effects. The dependency of the Fano line-shape parameters, used to fit the Raman first order peak in structures with high levels of doping, with strain is also reported. The results are shown to be crucial to accurately determine stress and strain from Raman measurements in doped silicon nanostructures and devices with size effects.
1585	Scanning Frequency Comb Microscopy--A new method in Scanning Probe Microscopy	We generate a microwave frequency comb having hundreds of measurable harmonics by focusing a mode-locked ultrafast laser on the tunneling junction of a scanning tunneling microscope having a metal sample. These harmonics, which are at integer multiples of the laser pulse-repetition frequency, are generated by optical rectification due to the nonlinear current-voltage characteristics of the tunneling junction. With resistive samples the harmonics are attenuated due to loading by the addition of the spreading resistance. At each value of the sample resistivity the microwave power is maximum at a different value of the tip-sample distance. This distance may be obtained by using different pairs of values for the applied DC bias and the DC tunneling current. Furthermore, with no applied DC bias, the same microwave power is obtained at the same tip-sample distance when this distance is determined by maximizing the microwave power as the criterion for feedback control. Using this criterion, in place of maintaining a specified set-point tunneling current as in scanning tunneling microscopy, offers the possibility of obtaining finer resolution in the tip-sample distance and greater stability with resistive samples. This new procedure may enable nondestructive measurement of the carrier profile of semiconductors with true sub-nanometer resolution, which is required as the semiconductor industry progresses to the sub-nanometer lithography nodes. It may also enable measurements with fragile 2-D materials such as graphene.
1586	<strong>Nuclear and magnetic small-angle neutron scattering in self-organizing nanostructured Fe<sub>1&#x2012;<em>x</em></sub>Cr<em><sub>x</sub></em> alloys</strong>	Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) in self-organizing nanostructured Fe<sub>1&#x2012;<em>x</em></sub>Cr<em><sub>x</sub></em> (<em>x</em>=0.21, 0.43 and 0.53) alloys has been studied. The relation between the nuclear (<em>I<sub>N</sub></em>(<em>Q</em>)) and the magnetic (<em>I<sub>M</sub></em>(<em>Q</em>)) contributions depends on the alloy composition and the extent of self-organizing due to phase separation (PS). When PS is pronounced with a large concentration fluctuation amplitude, the two scattering contributions are identical, whereas when the concentration fluctuation amplitude is very small, <em>I<sub>M</sub></em>(<em>Q</em>) is negligible compared to <em>I<sub>N</sub></em>(<em>Q</em>). The relation between the scattering signals is critical when assessing PS in Fe<sub>1&#x2012;<em>x</em></sub>Cr<em><sub>x</sub></em> alloys by SANS, which has been mostly ignored in prior works in the literature.
1587	Highly sensitive detection of photo-thermal transient stress by a sub-nanosecond pump probe with surface plasmon resonance	Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) has attracted increasing attention for non-invasive functional imaging in biomedicine and biomedical studies. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor is a potential acoustical detector with high sensitivity and wide bandwidth for use in high-resolution 3D PAM. In this study, we investigated a simple Kretschmann SPR sensor, demonstrating highly sensitive stress detection in the sub-nanosecond timescale by directly inducing photo-thermal transient stress. To do this, we designed and used a sub-nanosecond pump probe system. The SPR sensor clearly detected the transient response from the thermal elastic effect, while a simple pump-probe sensor without SPR did not detect it. Our experimental results demonstrate a simple SPR sensor that can detect stress with high sensitivity and sub-nanosecond time resolution. This technique could be used in high-resolution 3D PAM by mounting a small biomedical sample on the sensor.
1588	<strong>Graphene-based &lsquo;hybrid&rsquo; aerogels with carbon nanotubes: </strong><strong>Mesoporous network</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>functionality promoted defect density and </strong><strong>electrochemical activity correlations </strong>	Electrochemical activity of graphene and graphene-based &lsquo;hybrid&rsquo; nanomaterials is crucial for energy and water sustainability applications, which requires delicate control over its geometric and electronic structures. We demonstrate that precise control of the density of defects, hierarchical porosity, and topological interconnectedness, invoked in hydrothermally synthesized graphene aerogel integrated with multi-walled carbon nanotubes that can finely tune morphology, structure, defect density and enhance the electrochemical heterogeneous electron transfer rate (k<sub>ET</sub>). We prepared a range of three-dimensional graphene-based &lsquo;hybrid&rsquo; scaffolds (or aerogels) and their nitrogenated equivalents with varying graphene-carbon nanotube compositions using two schemes (approach 1 and 2). This study allows us to correlate quantitatively between number defect density (<em>via</em> Raman spectroscopy; RS) and heterogeneous electron transfer rate (<em>via</em> scanning electrochemical microscopy; SECM). RS provided microscale structural characterization revealing localized vibrations. The first- and second-order Raman bands are analyzed in terms of band position, intensity ratio and integrated intensity determining structural disorder, inter defect distance, number defect density. The role of oxygenated (carbonyl; C=O, carboxyl; -COOH) and nitrogenated (pryridinic-N and graphitic/pyrrolic-N) surface functionalities and bonding configurations besides hierarchical mesoporosity are emphasized for understanding the improved physicochemical properties. The defect-induced increase in finite electronic density of states (DOS) near Fermi level calculated using density functional theory (DFT) helped in establishing moderate defect density for enhanced heterogeneous rate as a critical state such that the whole system becomes electronically activated while maintained structural integrity (sp<sup>2</sup> network). Moreover, it enlarges the overlap between DOS for graphene-based aerogels and redox probe, which signifies experimental correlation establishments.
1589	<strong>Dynamic behavior of droplets under interfacial jamming of nanoparticles</strong>	Interfacial particle jamming is known for locking a droplet in a non-spherical shape; however, the effects of jamming on the dynamic behaviors of droplets are not well known. In this paper, droplet impact dynamics are studied on a mechanically weak superhydrophobic surface whose outer nanoparticles (NPs) were detached by the impinging droplet and jammed at the droplet surface during retraction. The jamming degree was enhanced by increasing the impinging velocity, and unusual parachute-like droplet shapes manifested increasingly clearly at the rebounding moments. Likewise, oscillation prohibition, bounce damping, and final deformation were each enhanced with an increase in velocity. The critical impinging velocity for final deformation was much smaller than that required to generate complete droplet coverage, indicating that considerable local jamming was sufficient to generate droplet deformation.
1590	KdV Acoustic Structure with Exchange-Correlation Potential in Plasmas	The effects of exchange-correlation potential(ECP) on the profile of dust acoustic solitary waves (DASWs) in degenerate dusty plasmas has been investigated. The plasmassystem is consisting upon three species such as degenerate ions and electrons, andsclassical dust grains. This study is comprising upon the linear and nonlinear analysissof long wavelength dust acoustic waves in non-relativistic plasmas. The linear acoustic wave have been analyzed by using the multi-fluid model whereas to study smallsamplitude DASWs, modified Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation has been derived bysusing the reductive perturbation theory. The effects of dust concentration (Havenesssparameter h) in the plasma, and exchange correlation potential have been highlighted.sThe dust concentration and exchange correlation potential affect the solitary wavesamplitude and its width remarkably. Our results can be used to understand the characteristics of nonlinear electrostatic waves exciting in a dense degenerate Fermi gas,spresent in metallic nano structures or presumably in near-supernova environments,sin the presence of massive charged defects.
1591	Predicting Stability of Nano-Fin Arrays Against Collapse by Phase Field Modeling	Silicon nano-fin arrays serve as fundamental components of modern field-effect transistor devices. However, during the fabrication process of the fin patterns, collapse is often observed, but a full understanding on it has not been achieved yet. Here, we study the mechanisms of this pattern collapse phenomenon by phase field simulations coupled with elasticity. Along one given deformation path of the nano-beam, we are able to track the free energy change, recognize the saddle configuration, and estimate the associated energy barrier for failure. Our simulation results capture the fin arrays transiting from being stable, to meta-stable, to unstable against collapse, with increasing aspect ratio. The model predicts that the structure is more stabilized when reducing the liquid wettability. In addition, from the free energy landscape, we identify the minimum energy path (MEP) for pattern collapse taking place in the presence of liquid evaporation. These findings improve our knowledge on pattern collapse and provide useful guidelines for designing synthesis pathways of stable fin structures.
1592	Powder consolidation of nanocomposite Nd-Fe-B magnets by cold deformation process	High-pressure torsion (HPT) was applied to nanocomposite Nd-Fe-B magnet for the following two purposes. The first is to obtain anisotropic nanocomposite magnets by development of deformation texture, and the second is to consolidate bulk magnets directly from powder compacts without sintering process. Although no texturing occurred in this set of experiments, the consolidation was successful and increased the relative density up to 90% of a nanocomposite magnet having the coercivity <em>H</em><sub>c</sub> = 4.4 kOe and the remanence/saturation magnetization <em>&sigma;</em><sub>r</sub>/<em>&sigma;</em><sub>sat</sub> =100/165 emu/g. The shear strain gradient generated in a disc after HPT allowed us to discuss a relationship between shear strain and porosity, as well as the significance of shear in densification process.
1593	<strong>A molecular dynamics simulation of thermal bubble nucleation confined in graphene nanochannels</strong>	Molecular dynamics (MD) simulationsare carried out to simulate thermal bubble nucleation processes in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems, respectively. It is found that the nucleation temperature of water confined in a graphene nanochanneldepends strongly on the channel height in a nanoscale heterogeneous system. Once a channel height is reduced below 3nm, the nucleation temperature in the heterogeneous system is higher than that in the corresponding homogeneous systems, which violates the classical nucleation theory that homogeneous thermal bubble nucleation sets an upper limit for nucleation temperature under a given pressure. The abnormal phenomenon is attributed to the formation of solid-like structure for the water confined in a nanochannel, in which the whole water system has a lower potential energy than that in the corresponding homogenous system. Decreasing or increasing the solid liquid interaction strength may reduce or increase the nucleation temperature, which can explain the nucleation temperature dependent on surface properties in various heterogeneous systems.
1594	Explosion of the thick metallic surface during ultrafast rise of a multimegagauss magnetic field	The technique of producing a multimegagauss magnetic field on the surface of a cylindrical conductor with a rise time of less than one nanosecond has been proposed and examined experimentally on a high-current generator with a peak current of about 2 MA. In experiments in the conductor region, a plasma with a density of 10^16-10^17 cm^-3 is preliminarily injected. The fast increase of the magnetic field on the conductor surface is realized, as the J&#x00D7;B force sweeps up the injected plasma in the axial and radial directions. It has been observed that such a high-rise rate of the field is accompanied by an explosion of the current skin layer with the formation of a surface layer of a dense high-temperature plasma and a powerful pulse of soft x-ray radiation.
1595	<strong>Scalability and wide temperature range operation of spin-orbit torque switching devices using Co/Pt multilayer nanowires<sup></sup></strong>	Spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching and retention properties in Co/Pt multilayer nanowire structures with various widths <em>w</em> down to 20 nm and the temperature dependences of the performance in the nanowire device with <em>w</em> = 20 nm are studied. Switching current <em>I</em><sub>sw</sub> scales down as <em>w</em> is reduced. The nanowire devices show high thermal stability factor <em>&Delta;</em> &gt; 100 for all the widths at room temperature. In the 20-nm-wide device, while a magnetization can be switched by current from -50 to 125&deg;C with a marginal increase in <em>I</em><sub>sw</sub> as the temperature decreases, <em>&Delta;</em> of more than 100 is kept up to 125&deg;C. These results indicate that SOT-switching devices using Co/Pt multilayers are scalable in nanoscale dimensions and can operate over a wide range of temperatures, offering high potential for a wide variety of applications including automobile and aerospace.
1596	Magneto-Maxwell nanofluid in von K&#x00E1;rm&#x00E1;n swirling flow with nonlinear radiative heat flux and chemical reaction	We study the impact of Arrhenius chemical reaction with activation energy and nonlinear thermal radiations in von K&#x00E1;rm&#x00E1;n swirling flow of Maxwell nanofluid over a rotating stretchable disk. The influence of magnetic field is studied by applying it perpendicular to the disk rotation. Brownian motion and thermophoresis features are incorporated due to nanoparticles utilizing Buongiorno model. Further, the characteristics of non-linear thermal radiations on heat transfer mechanism are studied in view of Rosseland approximation model. The mass transfer analysis is inspected by employing the binary chemical reaction with activation energy. Similarity hypotheses is performed to facilitate the solution of governing momentum, energy and concentration equations. The transformed non-linear equations are attempted numerically by using bvp midrich scheme in Maple software for visualizing the influence of governing parameters graphically and numerically. The major outcomes of present analysis reveal that fluid temperature is enhanced with growing radiation parameter. Solute concentration is an increasing function of activation energy parameter. Moreover, the reaction rate diminishes the solute concentration.
1597	Engineering of the Resistive Switching Properties in V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> Thin Film by Atomic Structural Transition: Experiment and Theory	Bipolar resistive switching has been reported in ITO/V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>/ITO structures. Synthesized from sol-gel process, the nanostructured V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>&middot;<em>n</em>H<sub>2</sub>O xerogel thin film endures significant structural transition during the post annealing step. The impact of structural transition of V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> film on the resistive switching properties is studied in this work. The switching voltage decreases from 6.5 V to 3.0 V when the annealing temperature increases from 220&#x02DA;C to 280&#x02DA;C, and then increases up to 5.0 V at 350&#x02DA;C. Above annealing temperature of 350&#x02DA;C, the reversible switching characteristics disappears. Thermogravimetric measurement show that intercalated H<sub>2</sub>O molecules fully evaporate above 350&#x02DA;C. X-ray diffraction shows that the xerogel phase gradually vanishes as the annealing temperature increases, and only &#x237A;-V<sub>2</sub>O&shy;<sub>5</sub> and &szlig;-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> exist at high annealing temperatures. Ab initio simulations are performed to evaluate the formation energies of oxygen vacancy in xerogel, &#x237A;-V<sub>2</sub>O&shy;<sub>5</sub> and &szlig;-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> phases. The results are in good agreement with the experiments: the formation energy of oxygen vacancy is significantly lower in xerogel than in &#x237A;-V<sub>2</sub>O&shy;<sub>5</sub> and &szlig;-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, enabling the occurrence of reversible switching when xerogel phase exists in the sandwich structure.
1598	A versatile apparatus for fermionic lithium quantum gases based on ansinterference-filter laser system	We report on the design and construction of a versatile setup for experiments with ultracold lithium (Li) gases. We discuss our methods to prepare an atomic beam and laser cool it in a Zeeman slower and subsequent magneto-optical trap, which rely on established methods. We focus on our laser system based on a stable interference-filter-stabilized, linear-extended-cavity diode laser, so far unreported for lithium wavelengths. Moreover, we describe our optical setup to combine various laser frequencies for cooling, manipulation and detetction of Li atoms. We characterize the performance of our system preparing degnerate samples of Li atoms via forced evaporation in a hybrid crossed-beam optical-dipole trap plus confining magnetic trap. Our apparatus allows to produce quantum gases of N &#x2248; 10<sup>5</sup>...10<sup>6</sup> fermionic lithium-6 atoms at nanokelvin temperatures in cycle times below 10 seconds. Our optical system is particularly suited to study the dynamics of fermionic superfluids in engineered optical potentials.
1599	Irreversibility analysis of the three dimensional flow of carbon nanotubes due to nonlinear thermal radiation and quartic chemical reactions	In this work, three dimensional flow of a fluctuating nanofluid is examined in moving (rotating) coordinates. Carbon nanotubes (MWCNT / SWCNT) are taken as nanoparticles whereas water is considered as the base fluid. Xue's model for effective thermal conductivity (carbon nanotube-based composite) is utilized. Entropy generation is analyzed in the presence of both homogeneous and heterogeneous mass concentrations. The dimensionless variables are introduced to obtain the dimensionless form of the boundary layer equations along with the entropy augmentation equation. Equations are then solved using an explicit scheme based on the finite differences, and the behavior of the entropy augmentation, Bejan number and temperature is elaborated. The effects of various dimensionless parameters such as Reynolds number, Brinkman number and radiation parameter on the entropy augmentation rate, and Bejan number are presented graphically for MWCNTs and SWCNTs. Variation in the engineering coefficients ( Nusselt number, skin friction, Sherwood number) are shown with various emerging parameters for MWCNTs and SWCNTs. It is found that the entropy augmentation rate can be controlled by minimizing the action of the Brinkman and Reynolds numbers. The results also reveal that the heat transfer (rate) is bigger for SWCNTs in relation to MWCNTs.
1600	Frequency temporal variation of electromagnetic pulse radiation produced in a high intensity laser-solid interaction	In this paper we present a time-frequency analysis approach for electromagnetic pulses (EMP) generated by a high power laser interaction. To resolve not only the frequency components of the signal but also how they vary temporally, a scanning time window moving across the signal is used within which a fast Fourier transform is performed. The optimum period of this scanning window varies with frequency and we describe how this can be varied for signals containing frequency components ranging from the megahertz to gigahertz. This approach is then applied to experimental data and shows the megahertz components arise tens of nanoseconds after the laser interaction compared to the prompt gigahertz frequencies.
1601	Synthesis,structural characterization and electrochemical performance of x%Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> / (1-x)%TiO2 Nano composites for lithium ion batteries<strong></strong>	<strong>Abstract:</strong>In-situ dual phase x%Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>/(1-x)%TiO<sub>2</sub> (with x=30,40,60,70) Nano-composites were synthesized by sol-gel using molar ratio Li:Ti=4.5:6 by varying heating temperature. TGA/DSC studies of dried uncalcined gel with Li:Ti=4.5:6 indicated the formation of LTO/TO phases around 600&ordm;C to 800&ordm;C. TGA/DSC of calcined powder at 600&ordm;C/5h exhibited structural stability of the LTO/TO phase at heat treatment of up to 800&ordm;C. XRDs exhibited varying wt%. of LTO:TO due to varying heat treatments of the same dried gel with Li:Ti=4.5:6. Composites of LTO with TiO<sub>2</sub> showed reduced band gaps and predicted increased electronic conductivity of the samples for enhanced electrochemical performance as anodes of Li-ion batteries. XPS showed that in both LTO and LTO/TO nanocomposites, Ti cations are in the oxidation state of 4+, indicating the charge neutrality and suitability for oxidation/reduction reactions during Li-ion intercalation/de-intercalation.
1602	Estimation of Magnetic Particle Size Distribution for Ferrofluids Based on Nonlinear Programming Optimization and Improved Bayesian Methods	Ferrofluid or magnetic fluid is a new type of functional material made up of nanoscale ferromagnetic particles. It is a colloidal liquid that becomes strongly magnetized in the presence of a magnetic field. For its fundamental research and industrial application, the particle size distribution (PSD) of its magnetic particles is crucial to characterize its material property like flow behavior. This work aims to develop efficient and robust PSD estimation methods for ferrofluids under two cases, known and unknown distribution types. The main task of the first case is to estimate the distribution parameters for a given PSD. For this purpose, Lp norm method is employed to convert the PSD estimation matrix equation into a constrained nonlinear programming problem. Then nonlinear programming method (NPM) is presented to estimate the PSD parameters based on the magnetization data. The main tasks of the second case are to reconstruct the PSD curve and estimate the distribution type and parameters. To achieve these goals, an improved Bayesian method is proposed by using the estimation obtained from NPM as its prior information. Then a non-parameter hypothesis test method, Shapiro-Wilk test method is introduced to determine the distribution type of the PSD. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, theoretical analysis and Monte Carlo simulation are conducted based on the material parameters and experimental results of two ferrofluid samples. Through the comparison, it is found that the NPM is less sensitive to the noise like measurement error and it can provide more accurate estimations than conventional inversion methods, such as least square and Bayesian methods. Moreover, the proposed improved Bayesian method is efficient and robust to the noise, which can be used to reconstruct the PSD curves of ferrofluids without using the conventional time-consuming experimental methods like transmission electron microscopy.
1603	Electrical and Thermal Conductivities of Few-layer Armchair Graphene Nanoribbons	The tight-binding Hamiltonian model and the Green's function formalism have been employed to<br />calculate the temperature dependent electrical and electronic thermal conductivities of metal<br />and few-layer armchair graphene nanoribbon semiconductors and the results were compared with<br />the mono-layer system. It was observed that due to the overlapping of the nonhybridized $p_z$<br />orbital perpendicular to the sheets, increasing the layers of the systems causes the conductivities<br />of the layers to decrease. Also, these quantities are calculated for three different values of interlayer<br />hopping of the nonhybridized $p_z$ orbitals. The results show that in low temperatures, the electrical<br />and thermal conductivities of the system increase when the interlayer hopping term is increased.<br />However, by increasing the temperature, the curves representing electrical conductivities converge<br />to the same value while thermal conductivity decreases.
1604	<strong><strong>Lead-free Epitaxial Ferroelectric Heterostructures for Energy Storage Applications</strong></strong>	With the development of electronic devices toward miniaturization, light weight and integration, dielectric film-capacitors for recoverable energy storage have attracted ever-growing interests owing to their fast charging and discharging rate. In continuation to our investigations for achieving high energy density, we have grown lead free BaZr<sub>0.2</sub>Ti<sub>0.8</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (BZT)/ Ba<sub>0.7</sub>Ca<sub>0.3</sub>TiO<sub>3</sub> (BCT) heterostructures and studied the structural, dielectric, ferroelectric and energy density characteristics.  The BZT/BCT bilayer epitaxial heterostructures were grown on LSMO buffered LAO single crystal substrate by optimized pulsed laser deposition technique. The ferroelectric phase transitions have been probed above room temperature with relaxor behavior. These nanostructures show high discharge and charge energy density 9.74 and 26.55 J/cm<sup>3</sup>,<sup> </sup>respectively. These heterostructures show high dielectric permittivity, large polarization and high energy density characteristics well above the room temperature which may be useful for both high power and energy density applications.
1605	<strong>Feasibility of 3D-printed precision scanners</strong>	A flexure-hinge-based nanoscanner, which can be manufactured at home at a low cost is proposed. A prototype of the said scanner, fabricated using a three-dimensional (3D) printer, exhibited a single degree-of-freedom motion. Limitations with regard to material, fabrication precision, and actuator force were overcome, and crosstalk was reduced by designing holes onto the side face of the flexure hinge. Fabrication of such holes could only be facilitated by use of 3D printing technology. Experiments performed in this study demonstrate that the proposed scanner can perform linear motion over a 10-&micro;m distance over a voltage range of 30 V.
1606	Focus Article: Solid-State Nanopore Hydrodynamics and Transport	The resistive pulse method based on measuring the ion current trace as a biomolecule passes through a nanopore has become an important tool in biotechnology for characterizing molecules. A detailed physical understanding of the translocation process is essential if one is to extract the relevant molecular properties from the current signal. In this focus article we review some recent progress in our understanding of hydrodynamic flow and transport through nanometer sized pores. We assume that the problems of interest can be addressed through the use of the continuum version of the equations of hydrodynamic and ion transport. Thus, our discussion is restricted to pores of diameter greater than about ten nanometers: such pores are usually synthetic. We address the fundamental nanopore hydrodynamics and ion transport mechanisms and review the wealth of observed phenomena due to these mechanisms.  We also suggest future ionic circuits that can be synthesized from different ionic modules based on these phenomena and their applications.
1607	Effect of surface residual shear stress on bending stiffness of rectangular micro/nanobeam structures	Surface residual stress and surface elasticity have a strong influence on the bending stiffness of micro/nanofabricated cantilever structures. This study presents a sandwich beam model with two surfaces and a bulk layer to describe the distribution of the surface residual shear stress. By considering the compatibility condition of displacement across the surfaces, we obtain a specific equation of the curvature varied with the surface parameters of prestressed sandwich beam. The solution of the equation of the curvature shows that micro/nanobeam structures undergo axial and bending deformations. The effective modulus of micro/nanobeams can be either positive or negative. The bending stiffness of micro/nanobeam structures can be either larger or smaller than that of bulk beam, which is determined by surface parameters.
1608	<strong>Improvement of response time on hetero-core optical fiber hydrogen sensor utilizing Pd nanoparticles</strong>	A hetero-core optical fiber hydrogen sensor that employs the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) phenomenon has been developed. It utilized spherical Pd nanoparticles, which were able to absorb and release hydrogen more quickly owing to their large surface areaper unit volume compared to that with a Pd thin film.The Pd nanoparticles were immobilized on the surface of the fiber sensor portion bythe electrostatic interaction. The Pd nanoparticle fiber sensor succeeded in detecting hydrogen by observing the difference between the light intensity spectra with and without 4% H<sub>2</sub>in atmospheric N<sub>2</sub>. A change in the optical loss response of 0.32 dB at a fixed 850 nm wavelength, and rise and recovery times of 1.1 s and 2.5 s, respectively, were observed upon exposure to 4% H<sub>2</sub>in atmospheric N<sub>2</sub>, which may be one of the fastest response times among optical fiber hydrogen sensors.
1609	High performance 33.7 GHz surface acoustic wave nanotransducers based on AlScN/diamond/Si substrate	Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices usually work below 20 GHz, due to constraints of material&rsquo;s performance and fabrication ability. This work breaks through the resonant frequency limit and the highest resonant frequency of excited SAW modes up to 33.7 GHz at Ka-band is reported. To achieve this, a AlScN/diamond layered structure was presented to obtain high electromagnetic coupling coefficient K<sup>2</sup> for SAW, which shows more than 200% higher compared to that of traditional AlN/diamond-based SAW devices. In addition, an improved and robust electron-beam lithography based nanofabrication process termed &ldquo;SELSP&rdquo; was proposed to realize high-resolution IDTs and 30 nm scale IDTs were demonstrated. The performance metrics of the fabricated SAW devices, such as resonant frequency and K<sup>2</sup>, are presented and discussed. This work promotes the development of SAW IDTs for super high frequency applications.
1610	<strong>Property-Structure Relationship in Lead-Free Relaxors</strong><strong> Ba<sub>5</sub>RSn<sub>3</sub>Nb<sub>7</sub>O<sub>30</sub></strong><strong> with Tungsten Bronze Structure</strong>	Lead-free relaxors Ba<sub>5</sub>RSn<sub>3</sub>Nb<sub>7</sub>O<sub>30</sub>(R=La, Nd, Sm) with tetragonal tungsten bronze (TTB) structure were prepared by a standard solid-state reaction process, and the dielectric and ferroelectric properties were systematically determined together with the structures and microstructures. Rietveld refinement result suggested that a single-phase tungsten bronze structure in space group <em>P</em>4/<em>mbm</em> was obtained for all the compositions. Both the dielectric constant (<em>&epsilon;</em>&rsquo;) and dielectric loss (tan<em>&delta;</em>) exhibited a broad maximum with evident frequency dispersion far below room temperature, which indicated the typical relaxor nature. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns revealed that the relaxor behavior in the present system originated from the incommensurate modulation. The dark-field transmission electron microscope (TEM) images confirmed the presence of polar nano regions (PNRs) in the areas generating the satellite reflections of incommensurate modulation, which implied a possible correlation between the incommensurate modulation and polar nano regions in tungsten bronze relaxors.
1611	Interaction between indium tin oxide nanoparticles and ferricytochrome c: conformation, redox state, and adsorption scheme	The conformations and redox states of ferricytochrome c, before and after adsorption onto or collision with the surface of indium tin oxide (ITO) nanoparticle, are studied to understand the interaction between the cytochrome c species and the conducting metal oxide surface. The resonance Raman scattering and the optical absorption spectroscopy reveal that the change of pH at moderate ionic strength induces conformational transitions and redox-state transitions which suggest intramolecular electron transfer associated with the conformation. The conformations of the cytochrome c species are maintained after adsorption onto or collision with the ITO surface, but the redox states are significantly changed and the change depends on the surface structure of the ITO nanoparticles. The adsorption or collision processes are governed by the pH-dependent electrostatic interaction between the proteins and the buffer anions on the ITO surface. This adsorption scheme differs from the traditional one.
1612	Rheological (extensional, shear) and morphological properties of linear low-density polyethylene nanocomposites in the presence of modified and unmodified silica	The objectives of this study are to investigate the effect of modification of silica nanoparticles on the rheological behavior of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) in both shear and extensional flow. The silica nanoparticles surface was modified by silanization reaction and with hexadecyltrimethoxysilane as silane agent. Melt blending method was performed to prepare the nanocomposites samples. Characterization methods included Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and rheometric measurements under shear and uniaxial extensional flows. Sentmanat Extension Rheometer (SER) and parallel plate rheometer were used to investigate rheological behavior of the nanocomposites in extensional and shear flow, respectively. The shear data illustrated that for all samples, storage modulus and complex viscosity of LLDPE with the modified silica nanoparticles were higher than the samples containing unmodified silica. The extensional rheology results showed that regardless of the type of silica, the elongational viscosity becomes larger by the incorporation of silica nanoparticles. LLDPE containing 2 wt.% of the unmodified silica nanoparticles demonstrated strain hardening behavior that was disappeared by increasing loading of the unmodified silica from 2 to 8 wt.%. Another interesting result was obtained for the LLDPE nanocomposite samples containing the modified silica particles. By loading of the modified silica nanoparticles in LLDPE nanocomposite samples, a fracture took place due to gel structure formation in these samples. Finally, Kaye-Bernstein-Kearsley-Zapas (K-BKZ) model was used to correlate the extensional rheological property of the present LLDPE/ SiO2 nanocomposites.
1613	Modulating the semiconducting properties of buckled tin nanotubes by metal/nonmetal codoping: Band gap tunability from DFT computations	By using the density functional theory calculations, the structural and electronic properties of substitutionally doped buckled tin nanotubes were investigated in detail. The dopants (B, N, Al, P) were substituted at two patterns into the structure of armchair and zigzag nanotubes. The results of formation energies indicate that the doped stanene based nanotubes are thermodynamically stable. The band structure calculations indicate that both pristine armchair (8, 8) and zigzag (8, 0) nanotubes act as semiconductors because of their band gap opening around the Fermi level. For the B, Al doped nanotubes, the Fermi level shifts to the valence band edge, whereas in the N, P doped systems, the Fermi level shifts towards the conduction band edge. Thus, the mono-doped systems exhibit metallic characteristics. However, there is a direct band gap between the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum for BN-codoped and AlP-codoped structures, suggesting the semiconductor property of these systems. Therefore, B/N and Al/P pair doping improves the electronic properties of stanene based nanotubes by opening the band gap at the Fermi energy. Total charge density distribution plots show that there is non-zero charge density between the dopants and Sn atoms, representing the formation of covalent bonds between them.
1614	Multi-scale simulations of polymeric nanoparticle aggregation during rapid solventsexchange	Using a multi-scale approach which combines both molecular dynamics (MD) andskinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, we study a simple and scalable methodsfor fabricating charge-stabilized nanoparticles through a rapid solvent exchange,si.e., Flash NanoPrecipitation (FNP). This multi-scale approach is based on microscopic information from MD simulations, and is able to access macroscopic length- and time-scales using a KMC algorithm, which allows direct comparison with experiments and quantitative predictions. We find good agreement of our simulation results with the experiments. In addition, the model allows us to understand the aggregation mechanism on both microscopic and macroscopic levels, and determine dependence of nanoparticle size on processing parameters such as the mixing rate and the polymer feed concentration. It also provides an estimate for the characteristic growth time of nanoparticles in the FNP process. Our results thus give useful insights for tailoring the FNP technique for fabricating nanoparticles with a specific set of desirable properties for various applications.
1615	<strong>Uniformity Analysis of NbN Nanowires Based on Element Mapping</strong>	Superconducting nanowires with a super-large ratio of length to width are the core components of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs).The uniformity of these nanowires directly affects the key parameters of an SNSPD, including the detection efficiency, dark count, and time jitter. Uniformity is also crucial to the response consistency and the product yield of the manufactured devices. In this study, we performed Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) mapping and statistical analysis of NbN nanowires with different widths. Based on this, we established a method to evaluate the homogeneity of superconducting nanowires from the perspective of the element distribution. With the help of AES element imaging, we drew the distribution images of C, N, Nb, Si, and O in the nanowires. Based on graphical analysis, the uniformities of the element distributions in both the transverse and vertical dimensions were discussed, providing an intuitive criterion for optimizing the processing procedure of SNSPDs to improve consistency and product yield.
1616	<strong>Superhydrophobicity resemblance of rebound dynamics of colloidal droplet on miscible colloidal films </strong>	The present article reports a hitherto unexplored phenomenon of colloidal droplet impact dynamics. Colloidal droplets impacting on a thin film of the same colloid exhibits bouncing and rebound dynamics typically observed on superhydrophobic surfaces. Colloids of multiwalled carbon nanotubes, graphene, silica and Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) are used to experimentally study the droplet dynamics on respective fluid surfaces upon impact with different initial kinetic energies. The droplets show unique behaviour of complete rebound twice on impact, followed by hovering and complete coalescence. The rebound is an elastic process with dominant energy dissipation due to bouncing induced oscillations and is similar to bounce observed on generic superhydrophobic surfaces. The bouncing behaviour has been explained by appealing to the concepts of surface pressure and elastic component of the interfacial tension in complex     fluids. The restitution coefficient and retraction velocity of the rebound is independent of the viscosity and weakly dependent on the range of impact velocities, which is a signature of superhydrophobicity induced bouncing. Mathematically, the contact time of the colloidal droplets is observed to abide by the scaling law &tau;<sub>c</sub> ~ (&rho;R<sup>3</sup>/&gamma;)<sup>1/2</sup>, which is associated in literature<sup> </sup>to bouncing dynamics on superhydrophobic surfaces. Additionally, the carbon nanotube based colloidal droplets display a unique phenomenon of partial coalescence following rebound and continues multiple steps of cascade and coalesce events. It is proposed that the upward capillary wave mobility and downward fluid drainage compete and govern the possibility of partial or complete coalescence.
1617	&beta;-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> MOSFET Self Heating and Thermal Management	&beta;-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is in attractive material for high voltage applications and has the potential for monolithic integration with RF devices. However, the limitation of &beta;-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&rsquo;s low thermal conductivity will need to be overcome to achieve high power dissipation devices. A combination of Raman nano-particle thermometry measurement and thermal simulation has been used to investigate self-heating and thermal dissipation in &beta;-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> MOSFETs. The peak channel temperature is close to the drain edge of the gate, with a measured thermal resistance of 88 mm&middot;K/W. Experimentally validated thermal simulations have been used to investigate different thermal management approaches: Enhanced lateral heat spreading, flip chip, and wafer bonding. Substrate thinning and wafer bonding to a high thermal conductivity carrier is predicted to be the most beneficial, potentially removing most of the heat transport bottleneck associated with the &beta;-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> substrate.
1618	<strong>Predictive modeling of misfit dislocation induced strain relaxation effect on self-rolling of strain-engineered nanomembranes</strong>	Combining atomistic simulations and continuum modeling, the effects of misfit dislocations on strain relaxation and subsequently self-rolling of strain-engineered nanomembranes have been investigated. Two representative material systems including (GaN/In<sub>0.5</sub>Ga<sub>0.5</sub>N) of wurtzite lattice, and II-VI materials (CdTe/CdTe<sub>0.5</sub>S<sub>0.5</sub>) of zinc-blend lattice were considered. The atomistic characteristics of dislocation and the resulting lattice distorting were first determined by generalized-stacking-fault energy (GSFE) profile and disregistry function obtained through Peierls-Nabarro (PN) model. Those properties were then used to calculate the accurate mismatch strain of those nanomembranes with the presence of dislocations, and as inputs into von-Karman shell theory to quantitatively evaluate the effects on self-rolling curvature and anisotropy. The theoretical results were further confirmed by atomistic simulations of different crystal geometries and dislocation configurations. Our results provide essential theoretical insights towards prediction and design of rollup configurations for strain-engineered nanomembranes containing crystalline defects.
1619	<strong><em>Terahertz Time-Domain Study of Cu Nanoparticles:</em></strong><strong><em>Investigation into The Negative Time Shift Observed for Cu Nanoparticles</em></strong><sup></sup>	<em>We report the investigation of Copper(Cu) nanoparticle colloids(NPs) by using Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS) technique. THz-TDS measurements are performed on various volumetric concentrations of Cu-NPs. We have observed a different behavior for the Cu NPs when compared with the Silver(Ag) NPs</em><em>. Most interestingly, Cu NPs have shown a gradually increasing  negative time shift and increase in amplitude corresponding  with the increase in the concentration with respect to the reference signal(the host media) instead of the positive time shift and decrease  in the intensity of the THz signal observed for the Ag NPs. We have modeled the observed THz signal peak profiles for the different volumetric concentrations of NPs colloids and determined the phase shifts with high precision. The negative time shifts measured were explained to be caused by the advanced phase shift observed through a dielectric-conductor interface as the electromagnetic field transmits into the absorbing media in the presence of a thin layer formation at the quartz and the colloid interface. We have repeated the measurements(both for Ag NPs and Cu NPs) for aggregation and sedimentation control up to 1 week. The control measurements shown consistent results both for the Ag and Cu NPs. Furthermore we have evidenced the presumed thin film formation at the quartz boundaries by using UV-Visible Spectroscopy technique. For the Cu NPs we have observed a thin film formation on the quartz boundaries but not for the Ag NPs, proving our hypothesis on the different behavior in between the Ag NPs and the Cu NPs. </em>
1620	Modeling of the in-situ nitrogen (N) doping of graphene-carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrids in a plasma medium and their field emission properties	A numerical formalism for investigating the effect of in-situ nitrogen doping (N-doping) on the plasma-assisted growth of graphene-carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrids is established. The growth rate equations for the CNT, graphene and graphene-CNT hybrids are set up considering the energy balance on the catalyst particle and the kinetics of plasma species such as electrons, ions, neutrals of hydrocarbon, hydrogen, and ammonia gas that aid in N-doping. With N-doping, the hydrogen ionic species density initially increases and then falls, promoting the growth of higher order hydrocarbons in plasma. The electron density also rises with N-doping such that the electron-mediated ionization and dissociation processes, increase eventually affecting the availability of growth precursors. The cumulative effect of the variation in the plasma species density with N-doping leads to the growth of nanostructures with high aspect ratio. In the present work, the field enhancement factor ( ) of the graphene-CNT hybrids is approximated as the ratio of its dimension along the y-axis to that along the z-axis. The   of graphene-CNT hybrids is found to be larger than that of the undoped and N-doped CNT and graphene. Moreover, N-doping further enhances the   of graphene-CNT hybrids.
1621	<strong>Bipolar electrocaloric effect in Pb<sub>1-<em>x</em></sub>Gd<em><sub>x</sub></em>(Mg<sub>1+<em>x</em>/3</sub>Nb<sub>2-<em>x</em>/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub> ceramic:</strong><strong>relaxor with super-dipolar glass state</strong>	The finding of large electrocaloric (EC) effect in ferroelectric and relaxor materials in the past decade opens a practical way of refrigeration in upcoming era. In this study, the indirect method is employed to investigate the electrocaloric (EC) effect in Pb<sub>1-<em>x</em></sub>Gd<em><sub>x</sub></em>(Mg<sub>1+<em>x</em>/3</sub>Nb<sub>2-<em>x</em>/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub> relaxors; <em>x</em> = 0 to 0.1 ceramics, synthesized by the Columbite precursor method. Electrocaloric temperature change (<em>&Delta;T<sub>EC</sub></em>) is calculated from temperature dependent heat capacity and <em>P</em>-<em>E</em> hysteresis loop measurements, using a thermodynamic Maxwell equation. Temperature dependence of the <em>P</em>-<em>E</em> hysteresis loop reveals an anomalous behaviour around the glass transition temperature <em>T<sub>g</sub></em> ~ 204 K, at 5 kV/cm applied field for <em>x</em> &ge; 0.05 specimen, which is in the vicinity of a crossover from high-temperature positive to low-temperature negative EC effect. This anomaly has been explained evoking the critical slowing-down upon cooling, of the polar nano-domains&rsquo; dynamics to that of the super-dipolar glass state. The maximum negative EC coefficient <em>&xi;<sub>max</sub></em> is observed to decrease from ~ 0.4 K-mm/kV at 164 K to ~ 0.1 K-mm/kV with increasing Gd-content, where polar nano-domains&rsquo; response to the external electric field is believed to be sluggish.
1622	<strong>Decoupling Thermal and Electronic Transports in Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> Nanowires by Porphyrin Adsorption</strong>	Decoupling the electronic thermal and electrical conductivities is one of the limitations hindering a breakthrough in thermoelectric efficiency. After a conformal surface coating of bismuth telluride nanowires (Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> NWs) by porphyrins, the thermal conductivity increases from 0.8 to 1.0 Wm<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup> at 300 K without any obvious change in electrical conductivity. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations assisted by Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) simulations of electronic transport properties indicate that the electronic thermal transport is enhanced by the depletion of surface charge carriers, which results by the transition from metallic to semiconducting behavior. Thus, the adsorption of porphyrin onto the Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> NWs layer suppresses the surface electronic conduction, resulting in thermal electronic conduction dictated by the bulk of the NW. The results mean that electronic thermal transport can be decoupled from the electrical conductivity by changing the density of surface states on Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> NWs
1623	<em>Loss mechanism and microwave absorption properties of rGO/CIP/PVA composites</em>	In this manuscript, the new type of Micro-nano structure rGO/CIP/PVA composites were fabricated by disperse graphene oxide in the core shell structure of CIP/PVA, aiming to improve the dielectric loss of the composite material not changing the magnetic loss and thus improve the microwave absorption capability.When the electromagnetic wave first reaches the rGO, a part of the wave is absorbed by its dielectric loss, and the other part is through rGO or refraction, which is consumed by the CIP through the magnetic loss.When the thickness was 2.5 mm, the effective absorbing width (reflection loss lower than &minus;10 dB) of composite materials with GO and the prepared CIP/PVA composite at 1 mg/g was about 8.4 GHz.
1624	Molecular screening effects on exciton-carrier interactions in suspend carbon nanotubes	Photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements are performed on suspended carbon nanotubes in a field-effect configuration, and the gate voltage dependence of photoluminescence spectra are compared for the pristine and the molecularly adsorbed states of the nanotubes. We quantify the molecular screening effect on the trion binding energies by determining the energy separation between the bright exciton and the trion emission energies for the two states. The voltage dependence shows narrower voltage regions of constant photoluminescence intensity for the adsorbed states, consistent with a reduction in the electronic bandgap due to screening effects. The charge neutrality points are found to shift after molecular adsorption, which suggests changes in the nanotube chemical potential or the contact metal work function.

1627	<strong>Ab initio studies on the Sn/Cu interfacial properties during lithiation of Sn anodes </strong>	The high capacities of Sn anodes are accompanied by large volume deformation and diffusion-induced stress, which result in fracture and pulverization of electrodes and electrical disconnection with current collectors. In this paper, by using <em>ab initio</em> simulations, we investigate the influence of lithiation on the Sn/Cu interfacial mechanical properties, such as interfacial strength, fracture location, and debonding. The results show that interfacial strength weakens severely upon lithiation. For most lithiated Sn/Cu interfaces, fracture appears within the Li<em><sub>x</sub></em>Sn slabs. However, at high Li contents, fracture is favorable at the interface regions due to the strong anisotropy of Li<em><sub>x</sub></em>Sn alloys. In addition, Cu<em><sub>x</sub></em>Sn alloys formed at the interface regions could increase the interface strength and enhance the deformation resistance. Based on the simulation results and a linear elastic fracture theory, we construct a diagram that can determine the optimal dimension range of Sn&#x2012;Cu core-shell electrodes. These findings highlight the interfacial failure mechanism of Sn anodes and provide a valuable guide for the design of heterogeneous nanostructure electrodes.
1628	<strong>Structural and Electrical characterization of NaNbO</strong><sub><strong>3</strong></sub><strong>-PVDF Nanocomposites fabricated using Cold Sintering Synthesis Route</strong>	Nanopowders and nanowires of sodium niobate (NaNbO<sub>3</sub>) were synthesized and subsequently used for preparing composites with PVDF using cold sintering technique in the weight ratio of 80:20 (Ceramic: Polymer). Phase purity of ceramic powders and nanowires was confirmed by X- ray diffraction analysis. Different phases of PVDF formed under various process parameters were also identified. TGA analysis was performed in order to check the thermal stability of the composite. SEM was used to study surface morphology of the samples and EDAX analysis also was carried out in order to see the distribution of polymer in the composite. Dielectric constant and loss tangent were measured and compared with theoretically calculated values. Theoretical breakdown strength and energy density were calculated and found to be as high as 1345 kV/cm and 6.1 J/cm<sup>3</sup> respectively at room temperature. Discharge efficiency of 64% was obtained for annealed nanocomposites.
1629	<SPAN style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Morphology dependent resonance modes in highly porous TiO<sub>2</sub> microsphere</SPAN>	Micro and nano structures of Titanium Dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) are well-known for their photocatalytic application. High surface area and high light scattering efficiency in such structures enhance their photocatalytic activity. The present work explores the possibility of enhancing photocatalytic activity through mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> spheres by exploiting the coexistence of high porosity and morphology dependent resonance (MDR) modes. A controlled synthesis of TiO<sub>2</sub> spheres with nano-crystalline grains of anatase phase and high surface area of about 96m<sup>2</sup>/g has been successfully accomplished leading to mesoporous particles with uniformly distributed pores of small diameters much less than wavelength of incident light. Despite the high porosity, MDR modes are observed in photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of a single sphere. As inclusion of pores may produce significant changes in the refractive index (RI) of the resonator, and as the quality and density of the modes depend on the RI of the resonator, it is important to have a procedure to determine the RI of the resonator as well as to characterize the MDR modes. An iterative procedure that is quite general is presented for mode identification and for the determination of the porosity-induced reduction in the RI and for ascertaining the presence of chromatic dispersion. Presence of high surface area as well as of MDR modes of reasonably high Q-factor makes these particles promising for photo electrochemical applications.
1630	Influence of TiO2 Nanoparticle size on creeping flashover property of  Transformer Oil-Impregnated Pressboards	Nanoparticles have exhibited great potential in improving insulating property of liquid and solid dielectrics. To explore their modification mechanism on transformer oil-impregnated pressboards, TiO2 nanoparticles with different diameters of 5nm, 10nm, and 15nm were synthesized and used to prepare transformer oil-based nanofluids. The creeping flashover characteristics of both pure oil-impregnated paperboards (OPs) and nanofluid-impregnated pressboards (NPs) were examined under lightning impulse and AC voltages. It was found that the creeping flashover property of NPs is significantly improved with the decreasing of nanoparticle size. Especially, it is enhanced by 2.44 times under positive lighting impulse as nanoparticle size reduced from 15 nm to 5 nm. The results of space charge decay and trap characteristics reveal the decrease of nanoparticle size can lower trap depth and greatly enhance the space charge dissipation rate, leading to more uniform electric field distribution at the interface between nanofluid and pressboards and higher creeping flashover property.
